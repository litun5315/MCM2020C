3 of the buttons stopped working after a month of using it  it was used twice a day  do not recommend it  go use your money for something more durable  oh and also big plates do not fit in it  very nice microwave  great price really love this microwave  has the one touch settings that i wanted along with the  30 seconds button   its a great size for a countertop   it can be a little noisy when it beeps as others have said  we bought this microwave 2 years ago as part of a home remodel  it was great while it worked but recently stopped working  sharp warranty is only 1 year  for the amount of money we spent on this i would expect it to last more than 2 years  was pleased with the packaging and easy instructions to set it up  worth  55 and that it was  prime  34  order  the finish is nice and matches our stainless steel black wall oven nicely  however  the button to open the door no longer opens on the first try or needs some help  and occasionally something internal to the microwave makes a noise when the tray is rotating  excellent small microwave   i recently moved to an apartment which did not have a built in microwave  but also a kitchen that wasn t that big   this microwave was perfect for it   its footprint is small  however it packs a punch   all my plates fit it and cooks everything evenly   the only downside is that when opening or closing the door  the whole microwave sometimes may move as it s not the heaviest out there  but i m not going to fault it for that  i just simply put my other hand on top of it while opening closing  works really well love this microwave   gives me more space in my kitchen    only con is the price  i never used this for my wife insisted we buy a new microwave after i bought this  i did contact ge and they gave me a 20  credit  and said not to worry about  paint peeling off  tell that to your wife  that was ok because i read some reviews which made it sound alittle difficult to use  had this for about a week and so far it s been great  the microwaving powder is quite strong  but the grill plate is too high for some bulkier food  that would be my only complain  this is a funny story    years ago my husband found one of these cube microwaves at a garage sale for  25 00   it was perfect for our daughter as she has an extremely small kitchen with very little counter space etc   recently i moved to a older home  new home to me with lots of charm and very little counter space  no room for an over the range microwave  my new little whirlpool cube fits perfectly into the corner space of my new little kitchen   love it  love it  love it    however  25 00 would have been an easier price on the pocket book  lol good price  has continued to work very well since december 2014  8 months   my only recent complaint is that the glass carousel no longer seems to fit tightly over the plastic gear in the center  it therefore makes a rattling sound as the gear turns  i don t see what could cause the loose fit  nevertheless  the carousel does turn  just not very quietly  br    br   otherwise  great buy  it is still easy to clean  i love using the 1  2 and 3 settings for one touch cooking times of 1  2 or 3 minutes  i really like being able to turn the microwave on for 30 seconds by simply touching   34 start  34  one time  some people have complained that the door is hard to open so that when the large   34 open  34  button is pushed  the entire microwave moves  but i have not had that experience  i seldom use the programmed settings for vegetables  popcorn  potato  etc  i had a bad experience burning a minibag of popcorn   the microwave didn t sense a need to stop cooking  however  it s fine for baking a potato  br    br   i do not understand the benefit of the rather extreme concave back to the interior  which contributes to the 1 4 cu ft interior volume  but the size is right for me regardless  certainly this was the best buy on amazon for my purposes  although it slides when you open the door  this is a great product  the size is perfect and it works great  br    br   because of how my kitchen is designed  i cant push my microwave against the wall   if you can  then your microwave will not slide  solid microwave for a good price  very attractive and useful mircorwave although only  5 it holds a nice size dish   i love that the controls are at the bottom  counter space is limited so this is peer   would be great in a dorm room too extremly satisfied great purchase   the microwave does the job and was a great price  excellent results works great  product was as describer and delivered promptly and on time  perfect for semi truck at 750 watts can run on1000 watt inverter i just received mine and  when it s running  you can see the interior light shinning through a gap on the top corner  not sure if this is normal or safe  so i ve submitted a question about it  for now  i ll give it a 3 star review for looks and the slightly annoying bang  the door makes when it closes  pending any heating and an answer to my question  i ll update then  i m attaching pictures of the gap  br    br   update  9 26 2015   well  the gap doesn t seem to be a normal feature  but it doesn t seem to affect the operation of the microwave oven in any way  i mostly use it for heating up leftovers and it works great for that purpose  have not tried it for any serious cooking  the loud door is far more tolerable now after a few uses  barely noticeable  updating my review to 4 stars  won t do five only because of that gap  we ordered it for a boat that we are rebuilding not real sure how its going to work yet  but it fits where we wanted it just perfect and we like the looks  that is about all i can tell you at the present time   terry good needed one in a hurry and my teen bought this  it s pretty powerful  it looks as if there are many brands that are actually this same machine  what a great unit   took some fiddling to install but the unit itself is really very nice  i had found a small blue cube micro wave some years ago   after 16 years of service it finally wore out   i love the cube shape and took a risk on ordering this little gem   i couldn t be happier   it is the great same size  the outside is fabulous and it has more power than the last microwave  would not hesitate to purchase this again  totally worth the price  love lg products  got product in a timely manner  works well enough for my purposes  just the right size  i dig the 1 touch feature for 30 seconds  start  and minutes  number buttons   it s also good that it has the removable glass rotator thingy  what brings the star count down are the button sizes themselves    uper tiny  and the handle  while this microwave is nice and light and the door seals well  that doesn t make for a good combination for opening the door  so i have to hold one side to apply opposite pressure to open the door  i think this could be solved with some super rubber feet  but i shouldn t have to add them myself  came in brand new package but item doesn t work at all  you can t use the   34 cook  34  feature with a timer going on the machine  but it heats quickly and is very easy to clean  this has been a good microwave for us  sure the paint has peeled inside  but for us it was only after 2 3 years  i just scraped it off  it is not needed for cooking  the thing that we really like is that the styling on the front completely matches our jenn aire stove right below it  cooking wise  it has been fine  and heavily used for many years  it is now reaching end of life  and i am struggling to find a replacement that fits the space and matches the stove  3yrs and counting  so far so good  lighter than the ge one it replaced   easy  simple to use touchpad   installation was easy and i am not the best when it comes to installation of appliances   i usually pay someone but the previous reviews indicated it was simple and they were right   you just need 2 people when you are ready to lift it up and hang it in place  install was really easy  and the microwave looks and works great  the buttons are really touch sensitive and it seems to clean very easily  just installed it  that part was easy after having read reviews for more expensive upmarket brand microwaves like lg and panasonic  we went to our local  canadian  wal mart to see what they had  br    br   the first thing i noticed about this one is that it is completely stainless steel  front and back  outside and inside  all around  it looks like a professional food service microwave  to me  the stainless steel interior is easier to clean than a white painted one  br    br   we have heard that microwave ovens don t last like they used to  we have one low quality unbranded otr one in a mobile home at the moment which was new in 1995   still working as well as it ever did  and another lg 900 watt in an rv from 2004  also a good runner at this writing  july 2013   br    br   we didn t want to spend a lot of money if the microwave was only going to last a couple of years  well  with this danby  we have a two year replacement warranty  if it dies before its time  we either get a new one or a refund of the money we spent on this one  fair enough  i thou    read more i couldn t enjoy our travels in our rv if i didn t have my sharp convection microwave oven  i just love it   excellent product    does the job   i have one in my home  and when an older over the stove unit failed in a rental  i immediately ordered another   a few things are tricky in the install  but were easily and quickly resolved   tenants happy  i m happy   in this case  the older unit had limited functionality  the whirlpool has several features new to them that are real benefits  love it  we really like the look of this microwave  we used the same model in our last home and liked it and just had a new home built and chose to have the same model installed in our new kitchen  we have never had any issues with it  it is classy looking  large enough for a casserole dish  and heats well  purchased this for college student and it has not been used yet  still in the original box  looks nice  however  awesome  very good item i was reluctant to get a microwave because of limited counter space that i have in my tiny apartment  so i talked myself out of not needing a microwave  but then i realize how convenient it is to have one and found this one that s just the right size  that s when i knew i had to get it  but don t let its size fool you   it can fit a full sized dinner plate  five star for sleek design and function  love it  the microwave does what it s supposed to do and is easy to use  i like the express settings so when you press any single digit it automatically puts in that amount of minutes  it is great for urban kitchen needs  for smaller kitchens  doesn t take up too much space or for bringing up flights of stairs it is nice and light  really compact  heats up food well  great for the price  our microwave was working fine  but had a number of rusty spots   i cleaned the inside really well and sanded the spots to bare metal   there was enough paint in the can to cover the spots as well as put a light layer on the remainder of the interior   i e  to give a uniform color appearance   the only issue is that it took a week for it to air out   you could still smell it a couple of weeks later   but eventually it went away   overall  i m happy   the 10 yr microwave continues to work well and now it looks nice again too  what a beautiful micro   i love it   works great  for the low price  it works very well  compact and nice looking  excellent  i love the shape and size  perfect for a small kitchen had not heard of this brand  was a little unsure about purchasing   really nice looking and very quiet   great value  very good this is the best  most efficient little microwave we have ever had  easily installed it is both attractive and operates easily this is the perfect size for the space we have and i think it s the only one that will fit  and good quality  i m happy with it looks great  works great  i ve been using it since may  probably daily  and haven t had any issues at all  it s stainless on the inside as well  so it wipes clean easily  food and beverages seem to heat evenly  great deal  love the versatality of this oven  it s large but heats food up quickly and is easy to use  only 4 star because of it s size  make sure you have room  mine is above my fridge which makes the push button to open the door ideal rather than pulling the door handle  we ve been very happy with this   not sure i liked the dial at first  but being able to dial in extra time is quick and efficient  i received the microwave and it didn t even work  i didn t have the original packaging so they wouldn t refund me  brilliant  lol low power but gets the job done  and good value for the money  as a den microwave or as a small office microwave  this is perfect and an excellent value  takes a bit longer than larger units due to lower power  but works well  prompt delivery and great looking microwave  i cannot wait to try out grill function  i already went through instruction book to familiarize myself with the functionality  great product looks nice and so far works great  very good deal for the price i only use a microwave to reheat coffee so when i bought my new house and it didn t have a microwave in the kitchen i was kind of like  meh  no biggie  however  after several weekends of cold coffee i caved and went looking for a small microwave that would look cute on the kitchen counter without taking up too much space  i am so freaking happy with this  it s literally the most adorable microwave that you could ever want  if you do   34 cooking  34  with a microwave  then this isn t your best option  but if you re looking for something to heat up a beverage or reheat something small then this guy is great for you  have i mentioned how cute it is   we replaced our over the range microwave with a range hood  we needed a small microwave to install in our pantry and this fit the bill  it holds a 12  34  plate and has multiple power levels for cooking  but we use it mostly for rewarming  it does take about twice as long as our old microwave but that s okay  one feature i really like is the one touch button for speed cooking  start will zap something for 30 seconds on high  1   1 minute  2   2 minutes  etc  that is quick and handy  this is a nice looking unit  it arrived right on schedule and was well packaged  so no damage  plus  all the features seem to work  i particularly like that the fan seems to be quieter than my old unit  my only complaint was  as noted by a couple of others  the installation instructions had the screws in the wrong places  fortunately  i didn t do the install myself  a pro did it  or the micro would have been on the way back to   34 home  34   the unit matches my other lg appliances  so  i m pretty happy  i ll update this after i ve used the micro for a while  ta  y all  not a power horse but great on space for my tiny kitchen  it works just fine  i needed a vertical microwave to fit a special spot in my galley   this unit has proven to have both the power and interior space to meet all my needs  excellent quality  fixed our  500 microwave  learned that mfg offer 10 year warranty  i was a bit concerned after reading some of the ratings  but i took the plunge    and i m glad i did   it does everything as good or better than advertised   as with most products  the manual could stand some extra effort  simplification   so those who don t read it do so at their own peril   both my wife and i are pleased with this product and hope it lasts as long as my original samsung  11 years   first   it s pretty big  something to considering if you live in an nyc apartment   second   the door makes a pretty loud noise when you close the door  third   there s a noise coming from the unit which sounds like the glass plate is shaking every time i use it  overall  it heats up my food  that s all i really need  getting good use in a small office  and working well   seems to be well built  and holding up well in a tough environment   good value  good this has been a great little addition  the plate is as large as a that of a larger microwave  but this fits in smaller space    in this case  in a corner  simple and basic microwave  works as expected and does the job  perfect for limited space on a countertop  just a month  no issues  no particular shortcomings  nothing really outstanding  just working as a reasonable microwave should  super love this microwave   it fit perfectly in the area i wanted it to   i wanted a simple  smaller microwave and this fit the bill   most microwaves are larger and have too many bells and whistles for me   it is very attractive   i wanted some stainless to match my other appliances   i have another danby product  dehumidifier  and find danby to be a good product   in one review i read it said the microwave slid when opening the door   i haven t found this to be a problem at all   the price for this is great   would definitely recommend it  so far so good  it s just big enough to fit my large ikea plates  i didn t think it would be  so i was pleasantly surprised  i didn t want to sacrifice counter space  and this was the best option  it seems to heat up pretty well  sometimes it takes a little longer than other microwaves  but for me an extra minute isn t a big deal  for the size and price  it s a fantastic buy  br    br   edit  just thought i d update  it s been 2 years and it s still going strong  no issues whatsoever  it works just as well as when i purchased it  it s ok perfect for our backroom   very pleased with the product  what can you say about a part that fits specific applications  it replaced the broken turntable motor in the microwave  now the microwave doesn t burn things on one side and leave the rest cold  so  it s great that the microwave is works again  the motor was considerably cheaper than having to get a new microwave  which is the best thing about it  br   it was easy to swap out once the cover was removed from the bottom of the microwave  getting to the turntable motor in a counter top microwave takes a chisel  or snips  etc   to cut the tabs holding the cover panel to the sheet metal bottom of the oven  then it s just a case of removing one screw and unplugging a connector  just reverse the process and its back in place and you are in business  the cover plate may need a screw to hold it in place when you reassemble the microwave  it wasn t included with the motor  but is easy enough to find at the hardware store  or scavenge from some old  unused electronics   excellent i have had this microwave for about 5 months now and it is working perfectly  the settings on the front are easy to use  i regularly use the 30 second option on the   34 start  34  button  and it cooks evenly  1100 watts is good enough for everything i cook and i like the fact that there is a light when you open the door  i think 5 beeps at the end of cooking is excessive but i do like the fact that there is no reminder beep after 1 minute  plenty of items need to sit in the microwave for 2 minutes after cooking and a reminder beep is annoying  personal preference though   it is big enough to take a dinner plate but still a nice size for a small kitchen  i like the look of it too   clean lines  i knocked a star off because the door button needs a lot of pressure to open and the microwave slides away from me unless i hold it with the other hand  perhaps putting the microwave on a non slip mat would solve that issue  we had the olver range model in our house but had leave it when we downsized into an apartment  this is the countertop model of the one we had to leave behind  as the wiseman said br   i have a happy life when i have a happy wife  i love the simple controls of this microwave could not have asked for anything better  the price was so cheap and the microwave works very well  br    br   the door is kind of hard to open  when i open it with one hand  i tend to push the machine a little  br    br   no issues with heating and seems to work well  br    br   the sound is kind of loud  but it is a microwave  a little smaller than i anticipated  but still great   i should ve just read the dimensions better very nice microwave  good size  programming buttons very clear and easy to use  the only reason i gave this 4 stars is the door closure  maybe for some folks  having a door that latches so tight you have to hold onto the oven itself when pushing button to open door is a good thing but not for me  really wish there was a way to adjust this a bit aggravating to have to hang on to it so i don t shove it off the stand to open the door  and one small note   i haven t figured out yet if you can use timer and then go ahead and cook in it without shutting off the timer  my old one you could and find that to be a feature i miss have written to danby to ask if i m missing something on how to do this but they seem to be slow to respond  update  danby took over a week to respond but it s as i feared you cannot set timer and still use microwave to cook oh well but definitely gonna miss that feature from my old microwave  and make sure that when you check a review for danby microwave  it is for the actual model you are looking at amazon has chosen to lump all danby model reviews so whereas this review is for 1 1 and 1000 watt  some reviews are all the way down to the  7 and there seems to be a wide gap in reviews  works very well if you properly prepare your old microwave first by degreasing  sanding  cleaning and taping it off before applying multiple light coats  the oven  stopped working  1 month after i got it  samsung is unhelpful  a repair guy came said he fixed it  it is still not working  br   i have been chasing samsung for 2 weeks  i like sharp microwaves  my mother had one for 40 years and i have had one for 30 years before both required repair  my microwave needed a new magnetron and fuse which i fixed for  125 00  my mother s microwave had to be replaced as we could not find all of the replacement parts we needed  hence  i purchased the one above  almost an exact replacement  it works very well and is easy to use  but i am not happy with the outward appearance  too much black and it looks cheap compared to her original one  good this is a very good microwave  it is perfect for places with limited counter space  it is small  you won t be able to cook full meals with this microwave but it is perfect for basic microwave uses such as heating up frozen vegetables and reheating leftovers  so far it has worked just fine  i have not used it yet but it looks exactly same size that we have   hope it works well  then it s a great deal   matched its description  successfully replaced broken part on my samsung dishwasher  does the job needed  which was mostly just to keep the top dishwasher rack in highest position  i have used lever to raise and lower but it s just not some thing i need often  hard to install  had to really press on it using tools  before it made an audible snapping sound and settled into place  it only goes in one way  in a specific place  so pay attention because force is required and forceful install in wrong place will destroy it  since it is a hard plastic  i could see where the plastic mounting tabs showed stress from the install   i worried they would break off during my efforts   important to know that these are side specific  you need to buy a right or a left to fit the need because it cannot switch between them   when one breaks  the others carry the load and break sooner so buy spares  ensure your purchase specifies right  left  or both  good i love it  hoping its lasting  my friends and family was excited thought i changed my dishwasher works well  but same gripes as other reviewers  no handle  slides too easily  perfect space and size  i have no cabinet space and this works perfectly  but you can t put a regular size plate in it  still serves their purpose  the push buttons are ok but occasionally have to push harder to operate  we love this  one of our favorite parts of the kitchen remodel  such a space saver and it just is cool  i read some negative reviews   all stemming from not have a revolving plate and might be damaged if someone pushes down on it  well duh  i have a 5yo and 8yo   they know not to stand on in the microwave  and it s 2015   who needs a revolving plate  i use a microwave for quick stuff  not rotisserie chicken and what not  we are super pleased with this microwave  i bought this m w for use in an apartment after reading the good reviews on amazon  functionality and performance and even look wise  this has been a great buy  no complaints there  but a couple of important downsides to this microwave   it is loud and keeps beeping even after the timer is done  there is no 30 second timer which is already mentioned in some of the reviews q as  so  that is a fact  just confirming here  very pleased  save space  loved it this microwave is great  the size is perfect for my small studio apartment  not a lot of countertop real estate  and the stainless steel finish looks really nice   sturdy construction and works very well  the light turning on when you open the door is a nice feature  i docked it a star because the buttons are a little more difficult to push than other microwaves  but not too big of a deal  not as fun as i thought i would be fits my counter top  i have a small apartment  well and i am very pleased   does not take up a lot of room and seems to work very efficiently   thank you  am very happy with  this i wish i could give this zero stars  bought this last year to go with my kitchen remodel  every appliance i own is lg  washer and dryer included  luckily  they still work  i work all the time and prefer my food grilled  i rarely use the microwave  just bought it as a just in case method of heating leftovers  my microwave died today  just stopped heating  everything else apparently works on it  apparently  a faulty magnetron is a wide spread occurrence  i did a live chat with an online rep  she wanted to send me to a service tech over an hour away  i declined  i explained to her similar issues from most owners of this model and stated this should be looked at as being recalled  no way we all messed up our units  i forwarded her to the amazon reviews  she was basically like yeah  ok  do you want me to find you a service center  at the end of our conversation  she just ended the session  i wasnt finished chatting with her  i will never buy an lg appliance br    br   chat

great day  i didn t measure well and this wonderful piece of equipment was much too large so i had to return it so sorry i d have loved to keep it my mom really likes it just as advertised   nice looking  easy to clean and large interior    mno problems thus far  great  installed easily and looks great  it s only been in use for about a month but we have no complaints  fan is quiet  big enough to put lots of things in  but doesn t take up too large of a space on the counter  i can say this honestly as i have less than 9 linear feet of countertop available to stick anything onto  i purchased this in 2010 and it worked great  then a couple of weeks ago i came into the kitchen and saw the se error code  i wasn t able to set the clock so i unplugged it and started researching what the error code meant  as you have probably read in other reviews  this is a common samsung problem  the steam from cooking on the stove underneath the microwave damages the cooking sensor which causes the entire oven to malfunction  and please understand that i haven t used my stove top for cooking on a regular basis  br    br   after a couple of hours  i plugged it in to see what happened and was able to set the clock and use it  i was thrilled but cautious  which was good because within 10 minutes i heard the microwave beep and start cooking  i shut it off and watched it and within 15 seconds  i saw   34 baked potato  34  on the screen and it started up again  so now it s unplugged and will be replaced  br    br   samsung says it s out of the warranty period but will send a technician to fix it for more than it will cost me to purchase a new unit  i did get five years out of it so i m chalking it up to lessons learned   no more samsung microwaves  when they have this many ovens with the same problem  you would think the company would make things write  to be fair  i have always owned samsung televisions and been very happy with them  maybe the microwave business isn t for them  good machine great microwave   simple and compact  great value for the money great little microwave  really worked  the once rusty bottom inside of my microwave looks brand new  fit my microwave cart perfectly and works really well   great microwave at any price   i really think it s more powerful than 700 watts though  very satisfied   looking great  aaaa prompt shipment  great quality  stylish microwave  perfect for limited counter space  great item and seller  good microwave oven   priced right  setting too high will burn everything till learning curve is over   expect to burn a lot of food   8 26 15 re review  turn table inside quit working  5 star very happy with it simply the best microwave we have ever owned as described  a great little microwave for the price  it is a cute microwave that fits into the space i had   it is a little smaller than i had imagined and the   34 crome  34  on the outside is a little hard to clean   i works well and i am happy with it  great product powerful and beautiful microwave  very good product for the price  great product  looks nice    exactly what we were looking for  arrived in great shape two days after we ordered it  it is everything i wanted it to be  got it for my 92 year old mother who had a microwave die on her  so far she is very happy wit it  time will tell if it is a substantial product  but the price was very good  cheaply put together   very low quality for the amount of money spent  spend a little more and get a quality product  he has worked perfectly right out the box  it was simple to set up and easy to use  i ve used it to defrost meat  make beverages  bake potatoes etc etc and its been great  excellent value for money  it lived up to its consumer report s best buy status we had a samsung microwave that lasted a few years prior to burning out and dying  it s funny how quickly you get used to living without one  br    br   but we did miss popcorn  frozen foods and the other microwave friendly albeit limited uses that they have  in shopping around online i was sold in a large part by the positive reviews and we re enjoying the quality touches  br    br     great build quality this unit is very heavy and sound br    br     easy to use br    br     lot s of quick short cuts like  popcorn  melt   soften  pizza and so on br    br     large blue led clock and timer  br    br     sleek  elegant and transitional design br    br     super powerful exhaust is fantastic  ours is vented to the outside  br    br     bright white goes well with all our other appliances br    br   please note this is a basic microwave and lacks many of the features found on models priced at twice the cost  however  considering what we use a microwave for this unit couldn t be more perfect  this unit is huge and heavy so if you re handy  and can diy i suggest having someone to help you or take advantage of local installation by amazon approved installers if that service is available in your area   or a local installer of your choice  br    br   that said  with 1 000 watts of power this oven is extremely fast and efficient  if you don t need all the bells   whistles i couldn t recommend this microwave strongly enough  fine product  absolutely fine  br   actually  i recommended it to a friend   it was the right size for her  br   she ordered and received from you   fits perfectly for her too  br   i like the handle on the door   makes it easier  not built to last more than the length of the warranty   do not buy   anyone giving it high marks has not had it for two years  fits in my studio without taking up to much space  i have no down side to comment on this little microwave  it functions perfectly for what i need it for   which is heating bowls of isomalt for working hot sugar art  love it  i looked a long time before i found this microwave  it was very hard to find one where the interior light goes on when the door is opened  not just when it is in operation    this one does  is logical to operate and fits nicely on a counter top  the only thing on my wish list that is lacking is power  it s only 1 000 watts and i would have preferred 1 200 watts  this is a great little microwave  it fits perfectly in my tiny space so that i have a little more needed counter space than i did with my larger microwave perfect size for my dinner plates  i like the express cook buttons that allow me to hit one button to start cooking  cooking times for store bought frozen foods seems to be just right for this microwave  good quality for a low price  pretty simple very good works as expected  great value  i am in a wheelchair   cannot stand to reach our over the stove microwave   purchased this to place on he counter   now i can microwave to my hearts content   works great and priced right   would recommend it to everyone  exactly what i wanted  looks great for the price and works well  could not ask for more  love this  good size for countertops br    br   had it since january 2015 and loved every minute of it  it came with the diode which may have caused the problem and i would not have known it  good call  great value for the price  full array of function controls  takes up small amount of counter space  yet has plenty of room for a full 10 1 2  34  dinner plate on its motorized turntable  nice microwave arrived quickly was actually 40 dollars cheaper than in the local big box stores   very quiet  sleek look  grill function works well  so far we ve had it only a week but it seems to be doing the job as described  it s great great stuff   saved me from having to buy new oven   it s been a year  and it s still good  my over the range microwave died and the manufacturer no longer makes the model i have   because it will take me some time to find what will look correct with what i now have  i needed a microwave oven quick   took a chance  because i didn t want to spend a lot of money  and purchased the danby 0 7 cu  ft  countertop   i couldn t be more pleased   it works just great for what i need and it arrived in two days  it works  nothing fancy  no bells and whistles  it s small its basic and that s all i needed  big enough to fit a dinner plate and small enough to push into a corner  perfect  fast delivery  great microwave  the color description on the can is   34 snow white  34   the reality is this paint is an off white color   my ge microwave is a bright white color and this paint did not match   i still used the product and it worked well   if the directions are followed  the spray applies evenly and covers well with several coats   for my needs i liked this product better than the touch up paint with brush application   you also get more paint with the spray can  great small size  easy to clean  amazing price  very nice little microwave and doesn t take up a ton of space on the counter  the button pad gets very easily torn up  i m not a heavy handed person   owned this a few months and the pad is torn up  looks like something was chewing on it  especially the start and clear buttons   would have spent a bit more for a sturdier pad  otherwise it works great and looks good  works well  great small size  easy to figure out controls  great little unit  only big enough for one dinner plate  but does the job well  the microwave and is nicer then i expected for the price  it is stainless steel inside and out  they also include a replacement key pad cover  the only thing i do not like is the glass turntable did not come with a wheeled undercarriage to allow for smoother rotation  but other then that very nice and i would by again  this part was exactly what i needed to repair my microwave   easy install  it was great   the product came as described   on time and the right product  doesn t work on a pure sine wave inverter  great price  shipped in good speedy time   a very small dent that we decided we were not going to complain or worry about   oven was mounted  and neither of us felt it was worth taking out and starting over     works great  convection or micro  wave   fits under my cabinet   is pretty quiet   i ve only used it to heat up things   works great   takes up only a small amount of countertop  great product  really like it  and the price was amazing  br   i got in time and it was pack well  br   i would recommend it to others  one caveat let s hope it last a few years  br   martha good paint to touch up the interior of a microwave part was received on time and works perfectly  big enough for me  easy to use controls  great price we bought this microwave less than three years ago  it was handy and compact  it has now burned out in a spectacular and very dangerous flashing of fire and loud noises  buy something else  very   very good i event toast bread in it  thank you samsumg and amazon tooooo i ve had this microwave for about a year now and i am very happy with it   it fits in the corner of my kitchen counter and works just great for reheating foods and cooking vegetables  love the size  but didn t last a month  it works fine  i have been very happy with the microwave  it fits the space i have perfectly and so far has been working well  exactly what we hoped for in every way  br   after needing to retire our well loved advantium  we opted to replace it with a more basic microwave  br   after rewiring from 220  what the advantium required  to regular ol  110  we bought this ge microwave combo br   and had it installed  what separates this unit from other combination models  well  for one    br   we can use the timer and the microwave at the same time  something we kind of took for granted br   in having had the advantium for so many years no other microwave seems to have this stupidly basic br   feature  something we learned the hard way by initially purchasing a top rated sanyo unit  br    and they questioned us when we kvetched about the timer use of microwave conflict  insisting we were br   asking for too much  right     br   back to this ge  stainless steel interior is wickedly easy to clean  the  beep  tone isn t obnoxious  and the heating br   element cooks evenly  br   just perfect in all ways  can t say more about it  br   thanks  easy to install looks great  good microwave  bigger than i thought but still works well for my needs  fits right under my bed  for easy storage and use  definitely a perfect space saver microwave  it has been about two months and my husband and i love this microwave  we have plans of putting it in our new island as a built in  it looks great and works really well  the convection feature is a huge bonus   i would buy again  i wanted a small microwave to heat food more than cook it in the first place  for example  i bake a large casserole in my oven  keep it in the fridge  then later heat meal sized portions  this danby model is perfect for that  occasionally  i ll prepare a frozen dinner or pizza and its good for that too as long as the food container does not exceed the 9 inch  or so  interior rotating cooking surface  br    br   one thing to be aware of  and that is this is a 700 watt microwave  most food packages show microwave times for 1100 watt microwaves  this means you must cook things longer with 700 watts  no problem  do an internet search for   34 microwave 700 watt conversion chart  34  and you ll see plenty of charts you can print  i posted one i printed to the inside of a cupboard door and consult it when i need to convert the 1100 cooking time shown on the food package for my 700 watt danby  example  4 minutes at 1100 watts shown on package   6 minutes 17 seconds on a 700 watt microwave  br    br   this is a small sized unit with 700 watts of power  it may no be for everyone  however  it meets my needs exactly  also  it looks and performs well  i have had no problems with it  i m a satisfied customer  took off rust under turntable with dremel motto  br   then applied three coats ann hour apart br   very happy love the microwave  it works great and adds such style and flare to our kitchen  this model is a newer version of one that we had for many years  it fits perfectly in the custom cabinetry that we have  it looks great and functions really well  we re very happy with this purchase   fantastic  love this little bastard   saves my counter space and looks great  installed easily   so far i ve baked a chocolate cake and cookies with convection method  both turned out perfect  microwave works as i expected  everything we wanted in a microwave   all black looks better than just black face   has the 30 second add on feature which we both like   slides around  but that can be remedied with non slip material   has a nice   34 lip  34  at bottom so can be clasped while pressing buttons or starting which prevents slipping in the first place   great price for product  but time will tell for sure  so far i like this microwave   it seems like good quality materials and also well put together   it s doing a great job efficiently heating  exactly what i was looking for  i would of like more selection in the color what a huge waste of money   we bought this microwave specifically because it would fit into the little compartment of my husband s otr truck   we ve never had issues getting a microwave to work in the truck before    and to make matters worse when my husband called their posted phone number for assistance he kept getting passed around from one  um  i don t know  person to the next   we would have returned the microwave if he hadn t already put it in the truck and left from home before he discovered that it doesn t work on the power source  why not    we still don t know    looks like he puts back in the too large microwave and has to take it out and set it on the bunk in order to make a meal  br    br   we gave it a 2 because it is the perfect size and it does work if you want to use it in a house  but for some reason will not work with the power inverter otr trucks use  everything was perfect  excelent thanks was drawn to this one after reading all of the positive reviews  they were spot on  i m very happy with this purchase   this gives off a tremendous amount of heat on the left side and the back   simply touching the left side casually after it completed a fast heat cycle left a burn on my forearm   i then felt around the unit without touching and found the right side cool the top reasonably so and the back burning with heat   since this is a countertop unit and the side will be exposed in most applications my experience is that this unit is dangerous   especially if you have children   i am returning it immediately  worked great  looks like a new microwave  nice product for the price   delivered quickly  awesome microwave  seems much expensive than i paid for it  i did not care for the way the bottom of the microwave was not finished   i need a better finished bottom   the filter on the bottom does not fit in tightly enough  it fits perfectly under my cabinets   the measurements given by everyone are accurate  i was terrified this would blow the ancient fuses on my already electrically overtaxed retro apartment  but it runs with just a small dimming of lights  whew  it heats nicely and is quite spacious  the only annoying thing is that start stop are the same button  but   34 cancel  34  is a tiny button near the top of the panel  so often i go to clear the screen from leftover time and end up starting the darn thing again  i am used to cancel stop being the same button  i ll reprogram myself  in the meantime  i love it  br    br   side note  there is a cardboard y thing stuck to the side of the microwave which is not mentioned in the other reviews or in the manual   leave it there  if you go to the manufacturer s website  you can find out it s a mica panel to protect a vent  it s tempting to toss it because it looks out of place with the rest of the shiny chrome  but just leave it  trim kit  bought along with the ge microwave is just fine  not large enough to fill the gap in the kitchen cabinets since it is replacing the large size ge advantium built in microwave  had to get cabinet installer to fill the gaps between the cabinetry and trim kit  looks fine  is perfect if the area you are using it in is the exact same size  so watch out for that  this is a very slick looking unit  but unfortunately it doesn t heat things up fast enough  probably because it s 950 watts instead of 1100 like many others  the grill feature is a nice addition  allowing you to cook items you normally wouldn t cook  in a microwave   cosmetically it s a treat to look at  different than all the others out there   you can see the food inside while it s cooking  but because of the black interior it s not as easy to see as others   the front is all plastic    stainless it s not   the controls are nice  the push button opener is easy  the unit is relatively quiet while cooking  and overall we re quite pleased with it   however  if you like to nuke your food in the shortest time  you should look elsewhere  big enough for a plate of food   works great  doesn t take up the whole counter  great price  1000 watts works perfect fit perfect in cupboard  nice sleek design  easy to clean  haven t used the grill part yet but expect i will soon  working well so far   good the only thing it did was cover the spots    when i turned the microwave on it sparked   i had waited 24 hours   it is a ge mstainless on the out side   wasn t cheap and was a gift   suck it up and buy a new one  good price for good product br   the price was right and now after some three months of use  i ve not had any problems with it the paint did a great job  would buy again  nice i got a good bargain on this  looks good on the countertop  though small in size with limited power  it works perfectly well and serves the purpose  very nice small microwave  small footprint but still powerful enough  also good for putting it on a higher place   like on top of the fridge   all the controls are at the bottom part  great design   compact and efficient   easy to use  we have only used for quick cook and reheating and it does both jobs just fine  love it  just as described  works great  e z fix fit perfectly  worked great fantastic microwave  i bought it to replace a pos ge micro that failed in less than a year  very powerful  very intelligent settings and very attractive  looks and works great  easygoing to read key board   my old microwave is going strong  planned obsolete is no longer going to take me over  paint works great  prep took a while as old paint may not like the new paint and bubble  so prep  really nice fit and finish stainless interior wipes clean get it perfect size  and it works great  br   i love it   have had the microwave for about a month nice size and works very well and  quiet  shipping was a little slow due  to being out of stock but seems to be a good product made her in  usa  from what they say      this is exactly what i was looking for   not too large but will hold a dinner plate   heats food well  love the express cook feature  simply push  1 2 ect for however many minutes you want  it starts   runs till finished  also like the fact display goes back to clock time instead of saying end like my previous one  could not be happier   loved this when i first got it  purchased after reading really great reviews  however  i noticed that the top got really hot  and several weeks after purchase it got so hot that it shut itself off  this didn t happen again  so i kept it  until a month and a half after purchase i went to open the door to put a cup of coffee in and the top part of the handle broke  saw a piece of plastic shoot across my counter  i am returning and getting another brand  not going to waste my money on another of these cheap pieces of equipment  it has the 3 things i cared about   a light that goes on when you open the door  a quick one touch feature  30 seconds  plus single minutes  and it is the right size and power for my uses  i ve only had this about 4 months but so far it works very well  it s more powerful than my last microwave  i just got the microwaves yesterday and will add more when i know more   but so far it is good  i like the look and the ease of use   i cannot wait to try the grill feature   the grill feature does make it heavier  but not too much   also when comparing microwaves remember to look at the wattage as this is a bit lower than some and so cooking times will be a bit longer  died after a year    34 service may be needed  keyboard shorted  34  message   was told the replacement part cost  165 for smart board but may also need a new keypad  150    never again with ge products    buyers beware      works great for the price   innovative shape  perfect for limited coutnerspace in a small apartment    it s been very good  it replaced a much larger unit but this is a much better size  different controls of course but they re acceptable  the one time i used the dinner plate feature  it was spot on  the reason i knocked off one star  considered two  is because the turntable ring and plate dislodge easily if a heavy object is slid across or not centered when setting down  love this microwave   perfect size for our office counter  works very well and looks nice  the cord isn t long enough  so i have to pay more money for a longer cord  solid  nice size   working fine so far   good price and quick service  this is a very nice microwave at a great price  i wish it was 1 100 watts instead of 1 000  that little bit does make a difference  the only thing i can say is a slight negative is the noise on start up  it is kinda loud  but i would definitely recommend this microwave  perfect for a countertop  good  cheap microwave   i was able to tuck this into a cabinet which is great  since i do not like a lot of clutter on the counters   no complaints   works as expected   for what it is    a 5 5 stars  i purchased this for a gift and didn t open the box  the recipient informed me that it was defective   the door wouldn t close  i chose to have it repaired locally  as it was heavy for me to take to po   needless to say  it discourages me from ordering large objects through amazon   i can t speak to the good qualities it may have   i just wish the quality control had been better  perfect fit  i went to several appliance stores locally telling me i couldn t get one to fit  love the look and bot microwave and convection  wok great  was great until 6 months after received  it just stopped working  trying to contact the manufacture  will keep you posted on their customer service  great product at a good price and easy to install  had it for a while now  so far no malfunctions  decent size  i do wish it was a little quieter   the beeps are very loud  and it would also be nice if it had one of those buttons to press to just add 30 seconds to the current timer count  but overall pretty good  entry level  small and powerful  was here in 2 days with prime  best way ever to shop  recommend both the microwave and amazon prime   bought this microwave in 2011 to replace a 30 year old sharp carousel that was given to us 20 years ago  the sharp didn t heat evenly  but it lasted much longer than this one did  this ge microwave looks great and heats fast and evenly for the most part and i love the inverter defroster  but it is impossible to make good popcorn  no matter what settings i use it always ends up with lots of unpopped kernels and some of it burned  i wish the door closure was designed better  as with most modern day products  the plastic parts just don t hold up to everyday use  it currently only works if you slam the door hard  i have a feeling that its days are numbered and i won t be replacing it with another ge microwave   i bought for my father in law s truck  in terms of its size  it was perfect fit for the truck with inverter built in but as other people described  it s not working properly with the inverter  i think it will work normally with normal ac but not through the inverter  the inverter was rated as 1500w  so  50 inexpensive microwave works better than this one  i had to return it     perfect for my needs  compactness  appearance and performance   a very high quality product  looks good  only worked a week  first   timer would work but no heating occurred  next dy everything looked like it was good   lit up  revolving  timer working  but food temp was not changing  cancelled replacement and have not been refunded  covered well  prep was most work br    br   one can did the entire cavity adorable and it works great  not as powerful as my old one but the added counter space more than makes up for it  my covered corningware fit in it perfectly but my plates don t  a standard 11  34  plate fits mine are 11 5  not a big deal for me but if you reheat on plates you should measure them  compact  stylish and very efficient  wish it was all stainless steel  this microwave is fantastic   it fits into the corner of the countertop which i consider the dead space   i am unable to reach most things placed in this space but the microwave is perfect   i have more counter space   i would rate the performance a 15 out of 10 because it s so great  it is a fine microwave but i am not that happy with it  working but you need to set extra time to get your food warm up  what i normally warm up in 30 seconds when i had ge microwave oven now takes 1 minutes and 30 seconds to warm  i could have return it but i don t want amazon to tag me as product return guy  not recommended for anyone who is looking for fast action product  good value for money  satisfied fits into my cabinet space perfectly  glass rotating plate does not shift as my other microwave did  a good deal like it very much  heats evenly and easy to use  very good works great i loved the price on this microwave  so did my 90 year i ll grandfather   we bought it and he was excited to have back the way he can cook most of his meals  sadly though  half of the button do not work  he can not set the clock or defrost    i offered to try and return it  but he needs it to cook  and it can do that i guess  but i don t recommend this product at all  the unit burst into flames at the rear  right  shelf support  after 18 months of service   i was warming a cup of coffee  br   stay safe and don t buy this item  very nice and useful product got it quickly   it works great i love ge   i m an energy star freak   then tonight  1 5 years after i ve moved into my brand new house with brand new appliances  this microwave caught on fire while popping popcorn using the popcorn button   the popcorn was fine    but the entire top of my microwave has melted into gross plastic blobs   thank god i was paying attention  it is just the right size  it doesn t crowd the space  several samsung appliances looked interesting  features appearances  when we were upgrading our appliances  then i found a problem after diving into the customer reviews   the overall ratings are good  but for customers who give them low rates have catastrophic failures  e g  smoking induction ranges  more than other brands   we decided to stay away from samsung brand for our major purchases  as we got most of our appliances sorted out  we still need a microwave  this one  again  looked interesting  i thought ok how bad can it be  its neither too heavy nor too expensive  let s take a risk on this one  but i was wrong   long story short  after one month  the turntable starts to make noise  after 3 repair attempts over several weeks  we were left with the turntable not turning at all  to add to the insult  these 3 repair attempts don t even register in samsung s system  so even if the lemon law is more and more applicable to my case  i would have trouble claiming it   based what i found after taking apart of our broken samsung tv  i think the company put too much emphasis on using their own components  and some of them are not very good  that could be why we are seeing a pattern of reliability problems across its product lines  was extremely happy with the performance of this oven while it worked  however after only 4 months of moderate usage it stopped working completely  it made a loud droning sound  followed by the smell of electrical burning  and then would no longer would heat up anything  i would also note that the mechanism to open the door is annoying  it is located under the control panel and it would be better to have it on the door handle  arrived in well conditon  good quality product i love it however i had to return it and repair my old one as the door hinge did not allow for flush placement on left side  as its in a rv and thats the way rv mfg installed it we love our new microwave  i have absolutely nothing negative to say about this machine  it works great  and was delivered speedily  thank you  danby  for an affordable microwave that really works well  ii had the same problem that many people do with the ge caf eacute  microwave  the paint was peeling off after a couple of years and ge would not stand behind their product so i bought this paint and masked off the interior s good areas sanded and prepped and cleaned real well and sprayed a couple of coats  sprayed really nicely  covered well  not easy to run unless you really squirted in one place for too long  dried quickly  minimum odor  nice sheen looks like new  this was a good fix although i think it s probably temporary because the product problem was endemic to the unit and will probably continue to flake off but i m hoping that using this bought me a couple more years  the product came quickly and i was very happy  i would only wish that there was a little bit more in the can but for what it s advertised for it s perfect  there were some issues about the exact measurements  other than that it fit well  this was bought as an emergency replacement for a wonderful sharp combo oven   the convection circulating fan had failed  and there was no time to have it repaired   the fan motor simply needed to be replaced   the microwave function still worked perfectly  but i needed the convection oven for holiday baking   it was just before thanksgiving and i couldn t find a replacement of the the sharp locally  and no time for an on line order  br    br   i found this samsung locally  and it looked like it would fill the bill   it did save me from holiday disaster  but i ve been far from pleased with it   you have to memorize ridiculous sequences of the controls that offer you only numbers as feedback so the manual near at hand is essential   it will only accept two entries for sequence cooking  i used three much of the time in the sharp for extraordinary results cooking rice and polenta   now i have to enter the first two stages  then the third after the first two are finished  br    br   the temperature of the convection mode is incredibly erratic  i set 200 degrees and when i checked the oven temperature during cooking it was at 350   today i set it at 400  the maximum  and it never got above 350   i think the control circuit board is failing because i looked at the clock when it was 6 12 and the oven clock read 10 something   i reset the clock  then looked at it this evening at around 8 30 and it read 1 something  br    br   the only good thing about the appliance is that the beeper can be shut off    i hate those electronic beeps    as far as i m concerned samsung should stick to making phones and not try to produce products they don t have enough concern about to do well   i will avoid the brand for appliances  better than what s available at sears  works great  easy installation  i didn t like the black center as it doesn t match our kitchen  but for the price i m living with it     this kit fixed my microwave and it arrived before the weekend  worked great for a year or so and now the door won t close properly so have to get a new one   i expected better quality out of a microwave this expensive  excellent microwave and excellent convection oven combined in one compact unit  i think it met and exceeded my expectation you need atleast 2 to paint the entire microwave   2 layer  i am new to this   but it delivered good results thanks my niece was thrilled with the microwave being delivered to her door   nice size   works great  the microwave did a good job of heating  but had enough problems that i sent it back after 4 days  br   1  it blew the circuit breaker  which had held up to other microwaves of similar power for years  br   2  when starting  it made a worrisome bumping noise  br   3  the spindle rotating the plate often made a grinding sound  br    br   amazon   ups get 5 stars for making it easy to return  we bought this unit for a remodeled high end kitchen   i has been installed for approximately six months and we are extremely happy with our purchase  no issues whatsoever  i love the easy automatic open close feature and not having to bend down to put items in the microwave  the unit holds much larger plates and platters than i was able to put in my former microwave  which is really nice  it also has many useful features such as a sensor that can tell how much an item needs to be heated to be ready  as this was part of a kitchen remodel i simply told the product number to our kitchen cabinet company and they made the cabinets such that it would fit in perfectly as a built in   the item fits in well with our suite of other stainless steel appliances   no complaints  i highly recommend  fabulous oven  great price  so easy to use   really glad i found this   have the 4 4 cu ft all refrigerator on it s way too  works great  sorry for the delay  i just got my microwave working today  2 25 15   i was not certain if it was the magnetron and diode  causing the problem  but since the magnetron  in my oven  was 10 years old  i figured that might be the problem  however  after installing the new kit  my general electric  jem31wa  002  was still not functioning  so  i ordered new door switches  and after checking my old oven switches  i learned that the   34 bottom  34   normally open  door switch was not functioning  so  i changed it out  and   34 voila   34  my microwave is functioning perfectly  it took some time  but it is worth it  i don t regret changing out the magnetron and diode  as my old ones were probably on their way out  anyway   i had not troubleshot  the old magnetron tube  if they are still in working order  perhaps i can use them again  later  my most gracious thanks go out to martin microwave inc  and amazon  product works very well indeed  very nice microwave   i only use it to reheat things   size is nice  does not take up much counterspace  cute  affordable and durable   just weaker wattage than any microwave i ve used  also doesn t fit a standard size dinner plate  the machine is attractive and is performing within the range of all advertised claims and meets expectations  the control logic is intuitive and practical  great for microwave purposes  looks great and easy to clean   grilling  didn t seem to work well as shown   maybe practice makes purpose   dont throw away the instructions if you want to try other cooking methods  really great microwave  since living in an apartment in nyc meant small kitchen space  we needed something to fit accordingly  this microwave was the largest smallest microwave  perfect for our usage   simple  functional and good value  this microwave is rather quiet   love that the beeping noise ends after a few distinct beeps  my old microwaves beeps forever  br    br   easy setup  easy usage and easy clean up  love this microwave  i have limited space in my kitchen  it slides perfectly in the corner  one of the best micro waves i ever had i love this microwave  i only require quick reheating or a baked potato every once in awhile  it s the perfect size  love my new microwave   it looks great and works great too   love not having the microwave on the counter  great service  very good for a small and compact microwave  very reasonable price heats fast  reliable  amazing for the price  good quality product and good price  the button to open microwave door is very hard to push  i m sure it will get easier with use  delivery was on time the microwave look great more better then the picture and very good size very happy with this microwave i never got this item even though i examined it and placed and order for it of wehich i cancelled  it probably works better than the oster ogb8902 b0 9 that i got instead but has electronic problems  good product  stainless inside is easy to clean with rounded corners  designed well  good value for basic microwave looks good  and seems to be holding up a couple of months later  i gotta say    this microwave looks slick in my kitchen  nice led display    sleek metal samsung look    goes nice with my new samsung washer and dryer set    also works great and the controls are laid out intuitively  decent size and good finishing  works great  i had a small paint chip on the inside that would spark because bare metal was exposed  a couple of coats of this paint saved the day  it has a use that is far more than cosmetic  it saved me about  175 because i did not have to buy a replacement microwave of similar quality because i did not trust using a paint that was not microwave friendly  good unit but a rough sound when operating  wow  my microwave looks like new  this paint is very high quality and covers very well  i needed only 1 coat but did 3 coats just to use up the can because if i ever need to paint this old thing again  its probably gonna be time for replacement  excellent microwave   we had very limited counter top space and didn t want to take up a lot of that precious space with a full size microwave oven   this product fit the bill perfectly   it s been working great for several months now  no complaints at all  this microwave is whatever  it heats up your food  but that s about all it has going for it  the bottom three numbers don t work  they never have since i bought it  also  the paint is already chipping on the bottom inside  it s really compact though  so it s a good choice if you have limited counter space  i purchased this drawer microwave from amazon for a new custom designed kitchen we were installing in our home   my wife couldn t understand why i wanted it because she had never seen one before and didn t think the whole   34 drawer thing  34  was a good idea   she eventually  reluctantly  agreed because she didn t want a microwave to go over the stove and there were no other good options for our kitchen design   once it was installed  she said she liked the looks of it  built into the island    everyone else that has seen it really likes the way it looks also because it s kind of unique   when my wife used it the first time i don t think she wanted to admit i actually had a good idea but the drawer microwave works perfectly and it s easy to get cookware in and out since it s waist high with the door open   my adult son used the   34 sensor reheat  34  button on a restaurant leftover meal he was warming up to eat   the feature evidently   34 senses  34  the air inside the microwave as the meal is cooking and stops automatically when it s ready   pretty cool feature   i love the microwave   it adds to the custom kitchen design look and it works great    i think my wife even smiled one time when she used it  steel case was damaged on back side   was able to us because it was hidden when installed under cabinet   the only complaint about the unit itself is the stainless steel interior gets scotched from the glass turntable plate unless you rare very careful   the microwave oven features are great   very easy to use and looks great  lasted 2 years and then fell apart  the tabs that hold the window in place all broke off on their own  lg does not care since it is out of warranty  they want to charge me over  100 for a new door  it arrived in perfect shape and i just had to plug it in   i have been using it every day even though i have an over the stove one too   it is so handy to do small jobs along with the big one  perfect fit in my tiny kitchen   love the cool blue digital read out  i bought this for a gift for a family member about 500 miles away  he says he s very happy with it and that s all i need to know the samsung counter top grill microwave contains a lot of features including a soften melt setting and a grill capability but is probably too large for most countertops  an obvious drawback considering what it is advertised to be for  however  after using this microwave i can say that it works well and  while some its components are plastic  it seems pretty well constructed to me  the grilling feature   the microwave includes a grill and a setting for accomplishing grilling and the soften melt feature are nice  i tried the soften melt feature  for example  and it worked fine  i also think this microwave is attractive so that is not a problem  the only real problem i can see with this microwave is that it is just too large for most countertops  if this is not a problem for you then i recommend this microwave  otherwise  i recommend looking for a smaller microwave  works very well over the range microwaves are a wonderful way to save counter space  this one gives you the option of venting the fan to duct work  or back into the kitchen  and fit under my standard height cabinets very well  be advised that this requires a 20 amp gfi outlet to be installed inside the cabinet over your stove  this isn t hard to work out  because chances are in a newer house  your existing vent hood has electrical for it s fan and light  watch a few youtube videos of these being installed and you should be fine  my husband has been using this for the past month in his high school classroom  and his students have been using it every day to warm things up   it s already been getting a lot of use  and is holding up great so far  of course  i know it hasn t been used that long  so i ll be sure to update my review as they use it more  br    br   the nicest features of this are  br    br     it s a microwave that also grills and crisps food    so it really functions more like an oven than a microwave   it comes with a grill rack  and you can cook meat on it   when you use the grill function  you can put metal into the microwave       but just be careful that you take out the metal once you use it as a microwave proper  the gill function works fine  but doesn t make your food quite as crispy and nice as a regular toaster oven does  br    br      the crispy plate is also perfect for doing pizzas  and the students who have been using it to cook frozen pizzas have said that they are evenly cooked  br    br     the 1 000 watts make this pretty powerful   it s good at evenly cooking food  and doesn t leave those cold places in frozen dinners like cheaper microwaves do  br    br      there are ten power levels and a plus 30 seconds button  so you can easily add more time to your cooking time  br    br     a standard variety of pre set buttons make this good for doing basics such as popcorn  veggies  and potatoes  br    br     the exterior has a scratch resistant coating  and the stainless steel facing doesn t pick up smudges and fingerprints like stainless steel often does  br    br   the measurements on the 1 1 cubic foot microwave are  11 11 16 h by 20 3 8 w by 15 13 16 d in inches  br    br   overall  this is a really nice microwave   as i mentioned at the start of my review  i will update this as my husband and his students use this more  but  so far  they ve really liked it and it s held up well to constant use  quality merchandise    great value  works great  looks good but sticks out from cabinets  i had it installed and they had no problems what so ever  had it installed for a few weeks now and works fine  it s a microwave  you plug it in  fan speeds are great  first time ordering an appliance online and so far very happy  i know you get what you pay for  in most cases  but in this case  i don t feel i did  i expected it to take longer to heat than my old 1000 watt  but it takes at least twice as long  the turn table rattles  and because of it s light weight  you have to hold it with your left hand while pushing the button to open the door with your right  otherwise you will push it across the counter  very displeased  i loved this when i first received it  it looked great and didn t take up a lot of space  i really wished it hadn t died  but after 1 year of very  very light use  i turned it on  with a cup of coffee in it  and it threw out a small spark and some smoke and then it quit  it was quite scary  because i was standing next to it   i would definitely not recommend this microwave  this is a fabulous microwave  it does both jobs of a regular microwave and a toaster oven  what more could you ask for  presets are a bit off but it is pretty convenient to have  you can grill in this as well  though i haven t tried it yet   i ll keep you posted  i would recommend this product to others  perfect for my application the first thing you should know about this microwave is that it is big so make sure you have adequate counter space to accommodate it  i only use it for simple things like heating things up quicky  for this it works well  i haven t yet tried its grilling feature  samsung countertop microwave  1 1 cubic feet  stainless steel is a must buy for people who enjoy cooking meals in their microwaves instead of just zapping snacks and melting cheese   the counter top microwave is larger than most models and this one can cook main course meals and side dishes for you and your family   a medium sized pizza can be cooked inside it s designed to   34 crisp  34  instead of being kind of on the soft side like other microwaves   just press the easy to use preset buttons for all of your cooking needs and if you want to   34 grill  34  your food with the grill layer that works similar to the one found in a convection oven but don t expect the same results  br    br   overall  i have to recommend this microwave for those who prefer to cook their meals the fast and easy way instead of using a cumbersome stove or for apartment dwellers   you can t go wrong with a samsung countertop microwave  1 1 cubic feet  stainless steel  especially if the price is right  had the danby 1 1 cu ft model for a couple of weeks now  and really like it   stainless steel inside and out is really nice   didn t buy from amzn   got it for  90 from a warehouse store with a super liberal return policy  you know which one    and so far we really love it   one thing i wish it had   a   34 one minute  34  button   but it s a snap to reprogram the popcorn button for a one minute cook time on high  so no biggie  but it does mean that you have to punch in the time when you want to make microwave popcorn  this is a powerful and great looking counter top microwave  it s replaced my old 1000 watt sanyo  it has some features you don t find on many microwaves including a power saving mode  which turns off the led clock   a grilling element on the top  and ceramic plate  in theory you could cook a pizza  heat up some bacon all while retaining the crispiness  i d probably heat up frozen egg rolls before i do the any of the prior though  the grilling feature is gimmicky to me  first you lose height for reheating taller items  and i m not one for having an issue using the oven for a frozen pizza or a pan for your bacon  maybe even a toaster oven if you wanna reheat those chicken mcnuggets  there s also one more minor issue  the rotating glass plate is raised a bit too high around the edges than i m used to  so make sure you lift your item high enough to clear the glass plate when taking anything out  works exactly as advertised in my ge profile microwave  color match is darned near exact  i prepped with a wire brush on a drill to get as much loose paint off as possible  then sprayed in many coats to get coverage  i removed 1 star simply because the paint is very difficult to apply without drips  ould just as easily remove a star from the painter  me   the paint leaves a slight texture or roughness that was not present with the original paint which was quite smooth  nonetheless  i will trade this look anytime for the flaking paint of the ge oven  cleans nicely  and has held up without blemish since my purchase and application about 6 weeks ago  br    br   1 can will likely cover about   of a microwave interior adequately  since my oven was flaking  i needed about this much coverage or slightly less  if i had stripped the entire interior  i would have been short  solved the problem  easy to remove and install  just like the video shows  great item  works well  first i want to say i have no issue with the microwave   it is a great little machine   the turntable is nice and not usual for small and low powered microwave   my issue is with the price though   it is not worth over  50  even that would be too high   it is almost more worth it to find a cheaper one directly from wal mart etc  very basic  works fine  a little noisier than i like  both mechanically and the door  and is a great price for what you are getting  for instance  the microwave i am replacing cost about  800  i wouldn t say the same negatives on that one    but it cost 8x as much  this one is a good deal if you aren t looking for top of the line  great product  fast shipment this is not a one touch simple to use microwave as advertised  i bought it because many reviewers stated that the start stop button was also an   34 add 30 seconds  34  button  it is not  even the picture buttons are not easy  first you have to push one of them  then the number of them you are cooking and then the start button  that is 3 touch  not 1  i bought this for my parents in their nineties  no way they can use this  it s going back  p s  the inside is stainless steel and would be easy to clean  great suction not noisy i purchased this microwave at best buy  from reading the other reviews i guess whirlpool does have a problem with the way these units are packaged  my lg microwave suddenly stopped working and i am ashamed to say that the majority of my cooking is done in the microwave   tv dinners  oatmeal  popcorn etc  so i wanted to buy and take home my purchase immediately  after shopping at home depot  lowes and costco i found that none of these retailers kept over the range microwaves in stock  the same proved to be the situation at best buy except they had this whirlpool microwave that had been returned because of shipping damage and was available for immediate sale and for  100 00 off its  249 99 regular price because of a large dent on the left rear that cannot be seen after installation  i had read reviews and intended to buy a samsung unit but  i did not want to wait 3 days for delivery and for  150 00 i figured it was worth the risk  the installation went well  i found the instructions and templates provided good information on the installation procedure  i was able to install this microwave by myself  the lg unit i was replacing came with the home so i don t know how old it was  other than i bought my home 1 1 2 years ago  and it was considerable heavier than the whirlpool unit  the door on the whirlpool unit opens and closes better than the lg unit  it is extremely easy to operate and has been functioning flawlessly for the 2 weeks i ve had it installed  i have never been a fan of whirlpool dating back many years ago to a whirlpool washing machine i had owned  bad memories last a long time  this purchase seems to be a winner for its appearance  ease of installation  its functionality and unbeatable price  if anything in this situation changes i will update this review  but as of today i could not be happier with the service it is providing me  great microwave  it is much more expensive than the typical small microwave but is worth it for something of better quality and at least some elegance of design  controls are simple and light to the touch  i don t miss having a numeric keypad  doesn t clean well  and retains odor   but it heats very well   vapors accumulate on all interior surfaces  door panel  interior housing    this may account for the retention of odor   worth a try as microwaves go for general  light to medium use  great space saver  as far as microwave cookers go  this beats everything else because it includes a toaster grill  i really prefer using the toaster grill rather than the microwave even if it takes much longer to cook    so it s perfect for me  this unit looks really slick and it s so easy to use  very intuitive  it s about twice the price of other units but this is a high quality samsung product  i love it  br    br   highly recommended  i picked this unit up primarily for the convection oven function but have come to really appreciate its versatility  that said  the unit is not without issues  br    br   the short story is  the microwave function works perfectly and is perhaps a bit more powerful than my built in unit  the grill function is great   provided you use the pan that comes with the unit  the convection function is wonderful but never and i mean never use parchment paper in the unit   fire   the preheat function is problematic and 7 time out of 10 will cause your unit to stop working for at least 15 minute after it shuts off  especially if you interrupt it when it is the 10 minute post preheat time frame to try to use the convection oven setting  the unit is very sharp looking and feels solidly built  the two racks and accompanying pan are also reasonably well made  br    br   now for those who are interested  the long story  br    br   microwave  br    br   works just great  seemed to have more power than my built in unit so i did a boil water test and found it got the water percolating about 30 seconds faster than my primary unit  the kids and i have learned to dial the time back when we use this unit  br    br   grill  br    br   love this feature  i made the following   grilled cheese  upper rack and pan   7 minutes with flip at half way point  turned out beautifully  open face bagel with cheese  upper rack and pan   5 minutes  grilled to perfection  br    br   convection oven  br    br   i had pretty good but not perfect results here  baked russet potatoes  medium  were only partially cooked after 30 minutes when cooked at the maximum 400 degree setting  my convection oven cooks them much more completely in the same amount of time at the same setting  sweet potato fries were kind of a disappointment as well  they just did not crisp up like they do in my standard convection oven  chicken breasts and battered shrimp cooked in here were done more to my satisfaction but i did note that ineeded to keep the temp up about 25 degrees hotter than my standard oven to get the same result  french bread pizzas were a complete disaster when cooked on parchment paper   the paper caught fire  i checked the manual about using parchment paper   i use it all the time in my standard oven for all sorts of baking   and there was no warning about using it   but i can tell you it is a big no no  br    br   preheat function  br    br   well  this function is pretty worthless on my unit  i have successfully been able to use it and then cook exactly 2 times out of 10 in the 2 weeks i have had the unit  the first time we used this function the house smelled like it was on fire  the unit quit working and we thought it had burned up  the next time we used it  it cycled through the preheat and then the 10 minute after preheat time period and then shut down   it completely turns off  including the time display and will not work at all   the next time i let it cycle through  both the preheat and 10 minute cycle   the unit remained functional and i was able to convection bake afterwards  then the hubby ran the preheat and interrupted the 10 minute after preheat cycle to attempt to convection cook   the unit shut down again  as i said  we have tried this 10 different times and never been able to use the convection function directly after the preheating is done  even waiting after the 10 minute period of time is dicey  sometimes the unit remains functional  sometimes it shuts down  the hubby is frankly worried about this and so we never leave the kitchen when the unit is in use  br    br   slim fry  br    br   we have not tried this function yet but i will update when we do  perhaps this is the answer to my issues with oven fries  br    br   overall  this is a better multifunction machine than i thought it would be  i was highly skeptical of the convection oven side of the equation as my prior experiences with these sort of units  toaster oven convection oven  have lead me to conclude that they are okay at best  the oven on this unit really does a decent job with some finagling on the temperature side   ignore the standard advise to lower by 25 degrees vs  regular oven on this unit and you should be fine    for the price the unit seems a solid investment  my only reservation being the preheat function which i think i will just chose to not use going forward  br    br   recommended with above reservations  we needed a new microwave and after reading the reviews bought this one  great microwave  easy to use  fits in the corner perfectly  great for thawing  reheating and light cooking   really saves space  makes great popcorn too  color matched great  easy repair  we ve had the microwave for only a few months   the door design is similar to our last microwave that lasted only two years   we chose this brand because they seem to make a superior product   so far it heats well  it s easy to clean and has had no problems  works great  is a combination microwave oven worth the extra cost   this samsung counter top grill microwave certainly is   i ve used the   34 combi  34  button  30  microwave power combined with a single temperature top heating element  along with the   34 crusty plate  34  and grill rack to cook bacon  hamburgers  and frozen hamburgers   all came out tasting like grilled meats  not microwaved meats   br    br   the regular microwave features work like any standard microwave   the interior is easy to clean   the microwave door is a mirror that takes a little getting used to  see the attached photo    the only thing i don t like about this appliance is that the mirrored door won t allow you to watch your food while it s cooking  br    br   this is a beautiful kitchen appliance that performs the function of both a microwave and a toaster oven   but everything cooks with the speed of a microwave   at 950 watts  the microwave is a little less powerful than my old 1000 watt sears microwave  so i need to set it for slightly longer cooking and reheating times  br    br      cleaning tip   if you grill bacon  you ll get grease splatter on the roof of the microwave   bon ami removes this easily  without scratching the interior  we live out in the country where we are forced to use propane for heat   and we have a gas powered oven   so we usually don t make pizza at home due to the cost of propane   and most pizzas are too large to fit into our toaster oven  additionally  when it s hot outside  cooking something in the oven turns our whole house into an inferno   so we live out of the microwave  being able to cook a frozen pizza and have it be crispy   from the microwave  is so nice  it doesn t seem to ever get to the point where it gets it as crispy as i d like it   but i do like just about everything burned to a crisp   i m odd that way  br    br   because of the grill element on the top  there is not as much height clearance as we had in our previous model   but for the vast majority of things we cook  this is not an issue  br    br   the stainless steel finish is a nice modern update to our kitchen  this model has a lot of power for a compact unit  great microwave for my home  great i m not a  cook everything  every meal  kind of girl  but we do use it quite a bit for side dishes  this samsung counter top microwave seems like a nice starter microwave   it s not incredibly large  but for one person  it works fine   there are a number of pre set cook options that could come in handy  we tested this on the frozen dinner setting   the frozen dinner box was supposed to cook for a shorter time period than the microwave s pre set  but only by a small amount   the cook was even and overall  it tasted good  as far as looks go  this is a sleek little microwave   it seems to get dirty easily  though  especially the button used to open the door   it s not too loud while cooking  though  which is a plus  br    br   overall  this does what it should and has plenty of bells and whistles for those who use their microwave as their jack of all trades  works perfectly saved me the purchase of a new microwave   can t argue with that  i   always leery of appliances that blend several functions or operations into one device  my past experience has been that it is better to get one appliance that does one thing well than to get one appliance that does three things mediocre  but one thing i can say after running this samsung multi function baking  broiling  microwave  convection oven through its paces  is that it really does everything very  very well  because the interface is not intuitive  more on this in a moment   you will have to spend some time with the manual to figure out how to cook things the correct way or the way you want to  you will also have to extrapolate a little bit  because samsung does not cover every possible foodstuff and every possible cook method  still  by keeping the manual handy  i didn t have any problem making delicious food in any of the modes that i tried  everything except broiling   which looks like it would be quite messy   br    br   i started simple  with the microwave  while every microwave that i have touched in the past twenty years was literally self explanatory  just choose a setting or power level and cook time  this samsung oven requires you to select the type of food  the weight  what you are trying to accomplish  heat  defrost  etc   and it calculates everything for you and runs it  now  this sounds like a lot of tedious work  and in fact it is  but the first thing i defrosted was frozen japanese sticky rice  in a regular microwave  i usually just put it in at high level for a minute  stir it up  and i end up with a sometimes mushy  sometimes not  sometimes cold  or cool  or hot  sometimes perfect  sometimes inedible bowl of rice  using the bread setting on the samsung  i put the rice in  pushed the buttons and turned the knobs according to the instructions  and i ended up with perfectly defrosted  not hot  not cold  not a grain neglected bowl of rice  it was  in a word  amazing  defrosted without even getting hot  wow  the microwave continued to impress in this fashion  popping popcorn  defrosting frozen berries  warming cold bread  all to perfection  br    br   for baking or actual heating  again  following the instructions of the manual  i made a number of excellent dishes  what i failed to notice  however  was that the cook times for everything i made were predetermined by the oven  that is to say  before starting i never knew how long anything would take and in fact  until you push the start button  the oven never indicates the cook time you are in for  because these were main dishes and the length of time was not egregious  this didn t matter for the most part  until i tried the slim fry function  br    br   now  i have experience with these so called   il less  fryers  which is essentially what the samsung oven turns itself into in the slim fry mode  so  i prepped my potatoes and waited for my wife to come home before starting on the main dish prep  but before i did that  i started on the potatoes  the first step was to fast preheat the oven to 400 degrees  and it has a dedicated mode for accomplishing this  i turned it on and set to work on my other dishes  eight minutes later  i was ready to go  but the oven was still fast     preheating  i cut to the chase  put in my potatoes on the crisper tray  set it on the small rack that came with the oven  is there a reason why the tray does not sit in a fixed position on its sister rack    selected my quantity and hit start  the timer promptly displayed a cook time of 32 minutes  wait  32 minutes  i could drive to mcdonald    order fries  sit in the parking lot and eat them  go back in and get another order of fries and take them home to serve with dinner and i   still have 5 or 10 minutes before my slim fries were ready with the samsung  we had a fry less dinner  and slim fries  admittedly  delicious  crispy and light fries  for dessert  br    br   i don   know a serious chef who doesn t work within given time constraints  it   part of the task after all   there are even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows   so if you ask me  how  exactly  is a chef supposed to get the most out of this samsung  i have to answer honestly  i have no clue  not knowing the cook time up front is a serious handicap  i suppose if you used it enough for a wide range of foods under an extensive range of conditions  and kept notes along the way  you could develop an accurate chart of cook times that would allow you to get the most from this oven  but as it is  i think this is a nice microwave with a lot of great features that is hard to use for much of anything else  samsung has some good ideas and a great microwave  but with the quirky implements  required reading manual and the   e  l let you know when it will be done when we  e ready to let you know  feature  it is impossible to rate this any higher than three stars e even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows   so if you ask me  how  exactly  is

equipment  all as dedscribed  this thing is awesome  it looks just like a tv which cracks me up  it s a bit smaller than most microwaves in terms of counter space  but also a bit taller  it has no number pad for entering a specific cook time  instead you just hit the start button multiple times to add 30 seconds  it is powerful and simple  no complaints  perfect fit  excellent product and service first off  my family and i are very happy with the microwave portion of the samsung counter top convection microwave   it looks great in our kitchen and the stainless steel matches our major appliances   the black ceramic interior is also a nice touch   looks great and should be easy to clean   the turntable is a bit larger than that of the countertop microwave it replaced  and in operation the microwave is very quiet   one downside of this particular unit is it isn t the most powerful microwave out there   rated for 1000 watts compared to other 1200 and 1250 watt microwaves in this price range   however  it is sufficient for home cooking tasks   setting the power and time is easy  br    br   the other function we ve tried is the convection oven   we used it to cook some frozen hors d oeuvres  fancy name for pigs in a blanket  using the included metal racks and ceramic crusty plate   even though we preheated the oven as directed  we found we had to cook our food far longer than expected based on the time listed on the package  so there was no real time savings over using our conventional oven   in addition  the exterior of the unit becomes  very  hot when using this mode   i suspect that we will not be using the convection mode very often  though it is a nice feature to have  br    br   as for the slim fry   grilling   combined cooking modes  i have not tried these yet and i m not sure i will   these modes  seem  to use both microwave and convection heating  but it isn t clear how much of each from the very short included manual   it is also very unclear when the included metal racks and crisping plate should and should not be used    even looking through reviews and questions here you can see that samsung is giving very inconsistent information on this subject    in any event  i will take other reviewers word for it that slim fry is a mediocre substitute for actual frying   as for grilling  the grill elements only reach the back third of the oven  and i m not sure it is worth the inevitable mess created to try grilling in this oven  br    br   so overall i would give this samsung four stars for microwave cooking  three stars for convection cooking  and two stars for the other functions   four stars overall since it does its main job very well h the inevitable mess created to try grilling in this oven     so overall i would give this samsung four stars for microwave cooking  three stars for convection cooking  and two stars for the other functions   four stars overall since it does its main job very well  good this is a lovely oven  also a microwave  i have used this for a variety of purposes  as an adjunct to my regular oven and microwave  br    br   i would suggest this as an excellent choice for a counter top oven and microwave  but     make sure that you have the counter space   this is quite large  and the venting in the rear requires some space  i could not put it in a special shelf for the microwave i had  because of the venting    for that reason  i would give this 4 5 stars  as it is not nimble  and is a counter hog  it works fine but can get pretty hot  beautiful      microwave looked nice  but did not heat  it seemed like a fan was only blowing cold air  amazon has great return policy  however  and it made the unfortunate buy easily reversed  to address the leading question  br    br   yes  metal racks  that work  during the use of the microwave function  and the universe does not condense into a singularity and explode  what else from my childhood has changed  do you no longer have to turn the dial on a phone to make a call  drop a dime in the slot to call someone from a payphone  br    br   anyway  yes  there are metal racks for the microwave and the other function  follow the instructions  br    br   here s the skinny  br    br   this is more than just a microwave  you can see in the description all of the functions  and they all work pretty close to as they are described  br    br   that s the first real issue with the   34 smart oven   34  as the box labels it  the descriptions on the webpage here  they re almost as complete as the instruction manual  there s a bit more  but overall i would have liked a bit more in terms of device ideas and how to utilize it  especially with the concepts cooking types involved  i think the slim fry concept is great  but i d like to understand how it s working better so that i can do more than chicken wings and fries  br    br   you will also note several comments on the lack of timer  it s true  no   34 non cooking timer   34  br    br   in exchange  though  you can actually generate a crispy crust on that microwave pizza  br    br   the drop down door is nice  but keep it in mind as you handle placement  on a countertop  it drops down flush but this does require that the oven is a little taller than my previous microwave  br    br   functionally  i d like a better option when using the grill or slim fry settings than letting the grease food drippings to just drop down onto the turntable  especially because that thing gets wicked hot  as is reasonable  so you have to wait a while to pull it and clean it  br    br   but the functions work well  so that s the main thing  br    br   in all   great oven  not perfect  but i ve never met a perfect microwave  works great before this microwave found its place on my counter this week  i hadn t known how much i would love it   it heats food quickly  is easy to use  once you review the manual   and can serve the same functions a microwave and toaster oven do  br    br   what makes this microwave different    br     it has many possibilities  br     pizza is crispy on the bottom  when reheated  even on the microwave setting  br     it can be simple  or you can dive into all the stuff it can do  br     the size is comparable to our old 1 1 cu ft microwave  yet it can do more  br     the colors are awesome   the stainless is only on the front  which makes for less to clean  and the gray top and sides are not stainless   so they will keep cleaner  br     the dials and quick microwave settings are smart   to reheat something for 30 seconds  just press the button on the bottom right  once for 30 seconds  twice for a minute  etc     or  press the microwave button  turn the dial to the time you d like  backwards or forwards  and then press the start button  br     the clock setting is easy to set  br     the convection oven works for settings up to 400 degrees   preheat the oven first  and then select the convection oven   you ll need to read the directions in the manual first  but then it s easy to navigate from there on out  br     the oven includes a crispy plate  two wire racks  that worked great on the convection setting   a glass plate and ring   i baked some cheese onto the plate while using the convection setting and it cleaned up super easy  br    br   what may concern you    br      the microwave does need to be on a sufficiently powered circuit  not on a power cord    it does not have a long cord  so you need to be able to place it right in front of the outlet you are going to use or close to it  br      don t use plastic plates that are not microwave safe   one review for this microwave was mistaken  they said you couldn t use plastic in it   not true   you just have to use microwave safe materials   there s a thorough and easy to reference list in the manual  which is located inside the microwave oven when you unpack it   br     the oven does have a heating element on the top because it is a convection oven  so you will want to make sure you have a microwave safe plastic cover that you can use when you are microwaving   otherwise  it s going to be a pain to clean it up  br    br   other matters to address    br   it s always interesting to read other people s reviews   one reviewer didn t like the manual  because a cookbook wasn t included   honestly  i ve gotten so many cookbooks over the years with appliances and i ve never used them   the manual for this oven seems small  but it is packed with all the essential information you ll need to use it  and more   no recipes  but all the guidelines for cooking vegetables  reheating foods  etc   i don t cook in my microwave oven normally   i did bake spinach artichoke dip in this oven  though  on 375 degrees for 30 minutes and it came out perfectly  br    br   another reviewer lamented the lack of a timer on this microwave oven   that s not true actually   if you use the microwave function  the time counts down normally   if you use the convection setting  you have to select how long you want the oven to cook for and then it will turn off automatically when it is done   if you find you need a few extra minutes  it s very easy to turn it right back on   to use the convection oven  you do need to preheat the oven first  but that s not a problem   one feature that was awesome was that when i took my dish out of the oven to stir it  the oven did not start cooking again until i pressed the start button  so the time didn t keep going either    most people i know use the timers on their ovens or use a stand alone timer that they can take with them into another room if needed or move to where they will hear it when it goes off  br    br   all in all  i m very pleased with this microwave   it covers the basics and beyond very well   i don t expect it to do everything  grill  slimfry  microwave  convection   but  the fact that it microwaves and bakes so well is enough for me   many appliances claim to do too much and we expect one appliance to do it all   i prefer to do grilled cheese on the stove and frying on the stove  so i don t want to do them in this oven and risk having to clean up a mess   i m extremely happy with what i ve used it for so far ics and beyond very well   i don t expect it to do everything  grill  slimfry  microwave  convection   but  the fact that it microwaves and bakes so well is enough for me   many appliances claim to do too much and we expect one appliance to do it all   i prefer to do grilled cheese on the stove and frying on the stove  so i don t want to do them in this oven and risk having to clean up a mess   i m extremely happy with what i ve used it for so far  a good  small  functional  no frills oven  we decided to put up a chimney exhaust in our new kitchen  so a bulky  over the range microwave was out  plus  we never use it to   34 cook  34  from scratch  why have such a giant wasting space  my dear  handy  wood worker husband built our new cabinets  so it was no problem to create a perfect space under the counter for a new smaller microwave  love the drop down door  plus the features are incredible  slimfry  convection  and grill   note  the samsung is not meant for under the counter  however we were able to provide plenty of air circulation  so it has not been a problem  love this little microwave   we recently sold our home and have had to live temporarily in a small one bedroom with very little counter space   i found this one and based on reviews  decided to buy it and i am not disappointed   works better than any microwave i have ever owned before   very pleased with my purchase  i ve had this microwave for a couple of months and i have no problems with it  it is working very well  great for the money i love this microwave so much  aesthetically  it s the coolest kitchen appliance i own  it s also pretty powerful  that said  it s kinda small inside and square plates  16 oz coffee cups  and popcorn bags can pose difficulties  e g   when the popcorn bag starts to fill up  the tray stops turning   i still wouldn t trade it in  after several months of use i m happy to report it s still running strong  it heats food evenly with cold areas and is large enough to fit just about everything i cook  the sleek design and color also look nice in my kitchen  love it  this is a very versatile microwave  the basic functions of a microwave   heating  reheating  defrosting   all are performed excellently  but this unit does so much more   it comes with stacking parts that allow you to heat or reheat two plates simultaneously  which is extremely convenient  best of all  it is a convection microwave  so you can pretty much do everything you would need with this microwave   bake a cake  broil  etc  you can cook fried items in a manner that limits oiliness  i like the pull down door  rather than the open out variety   that function saves space  actually  decently sized   a little smaller than my previous microwave  but as much size as you could need  stainless steel is great   matches the rest of my kitchen   and its a high ended looking device  very solid  well built  good value for money and does everything it promises  great unit   we use it in our semi and it works wonderfully well  great size and shape for a compact area  i would definately recommend this unit   easy install  no video or instructions required  if you can get out to see where it is  you can get to it and install it  unit is running fine with no issues  i love this microwave  small is what i needed but  wow what great extra features and it is beautiful  i am beyond happy  yes it is small but  that is what i needed and what i am used to  i can t get my largest dinner plate in but  i can get my smaller ones in  i love how the back is rounded  i had a sharp half pint that finally died after 24 yrs  this has way more features than the sharp  i have very little counter space so  thank goodness i found this  yes  it is pricey but  well worth the money to me  update   62   62   62 i  purchased it 12 20 14 and it died april 3rd 2015  whirlpool has been  very nice and will be sending a replacement  this microwave overheats if popping more than two or three bags of popcorn   once it overheats  it automatically switches to the lowest power mode available  thus making it take forever to heat anything  you have to let it rest for 20 minutes or so to cool down  br    br   the microwave works well if you don t use it too much at once   but for more intensive use  buy something more powerful   really nice  the grill doesn t toast as well as a dedicated toaster oven  but the microwave is fast and easy to use   the fast preheat and the convection oven cook accurately and are perfect for smaller households   i haven t used the air fry yet  super cute  works great  because it s compact  some bowls and plates fit a little snug and the rotating plate has no off  otherwise  it s fantastic  fantastic product  made microwave look brand new again   has a strong odor for the first day   dries quick and looks great  came with a huge dent in the side  heats great  gets very hot    nice size for an apartment    gift for sister   she s happy with it  works great no issues after two years  the microwave died yesterday involved in black smoke  luckily we were able to manage  the mess before the whole house burned down  stay away from this company  great buy it is small but works well  i liked it i purchased this microwave in february  2014  it was  perfect size but stopped working within three months   after contact with whirlpool via phone and email  i was told by the whirlpool product review board to dispose of it in accordance with law because there was no dealer where i lived to return it to   i took it to my local metals  disposal site and provided proof of compliance to whirlpool   the whirlpool product review board then promised repeatedly over a three month period that a check would be sent for the purchase price   they apologized for the delay  at one time emailing to me that my buy back check order was stuck in the system   then  after three months of promises  whirlpool stopped all communication with me  more than two more months have passed since then and i still haven t received my buy back check  i don t expect to get one   do not buy this product   you can see from several of the reviews that you risk buying a lemon   in my case  i lost  152 78 and spent many  many hours  time and money doing exactly what whirlpool told me to do to collect on the warranty   whirlpool apparently does not honor it s warranties  at least not for this product  br    br   p s  10 days after this review was posted  whirlpool issued a refund check  a little loud  but is a great fit for our family of 7  perfect for apartments direct replacement in my rv for the original that lasted over 15 years   i hope i get that same life out of this one   all of the previous reviews were spot on  in the fact that the new one is very hard to get the two mounting bolts to start  took about 40 minutes  and the new models fan and motor are far louder than the old one was   but the unit works great in all categories  very pleased   we put the unit inside a cabinet with a sliding shelf   one less thing exposed in the kitchen  the 3rd one in almost 15 yrs   a good reliable model  what can you say about a microwave    it does the job looks nice   i am happy with it and the big plus it was delivered right to my door   no hunting around   carrying it in and out of auto   seems to be good quality awesome replacement  great quality with bells and whistles put in my older 2001 ge spacemaker microwave oven  works perfect and same replacement number  love the size and design   i have had it for over 6 months and still working well with no issues  i am really upset  i just got a mc11h6033 1 1 cu ft counter top convection microwave w slim fry as a gift  i contacted the chat support as i had a few questions  all of which were answered with  no  but only after i was basically told yes to all three questions and then dared to question the yes  br    br   i asked if there was a timer function  told yes  then told no after i asked the rep to tell me where it was located  and how to set and use it  who makes a microwave in 2014 that doesn t have a timer  br    br   i asked if there was a more extensive food prep guide recipe book available to use with the unit because the microwave oven owner s instructions   cooking guide literally only lists 1 food item per function  there s 1000s of foods that could be made using things like the slim fry function  but no way to know which of the 1 9 settings to use because there s only 9 food items listed in the microwave oven owner s instructions   cooking guide under the slim fry entry  there is apparently no app with this information available either  neither is there a formula for figuring out how to slim fry additional foods other than those listed in the microwave oven owner s instructions   cooking guide  this problem persists throughout the microwave oven owner s instructions   cooking guide in that every function other than straight microwave or straight convection cooking does not give enough information to be able to choose the correct function and setting for foods other than those listed  i only found this information out after asking which setting to use to cook pre breaded fried okra  i was answered  you can use the slim fry option 2 for pre breaded frozen fried okra  i asked  how and where did you find that information  he replied  i have gathered the information from our internal database  i stated  i don t exactly have access to your internal database  now do i  so  no additional cooking info publicly available  i guess if i want to try to slim fry frozen cheese sticks  i ll need to contact customer service and ask which setting to use because apparently  in the world of frozen food  pre breaded frozen fried okra is equal to that of frozen prawns  shrimp   breaded  that s the example food for slim fry option 2 as per the microwave oven owner s instructions   cooking guide  br    br   i asked if there were sheet pans  cookware  or bakeware available to be purchased from samsung  or elsewhere  that were known to fit in the unit  specifically sheet pans  standard size 1 4  quarter  sheet pans won t fit because the 9 5 x 13 size is determined by the usable flat surface area and not the outside of the pan itself  no standard 9 5 x 13 sheet pan is 9 5 x 13 on the outside dimensions that i am aware of  so  where would i get pans that fit  apparently customer service  nor parts  has a clue  who makes the inside of an appliance  capable of being a convection oven  too small for standard size bakeware  toaster ovens don t count   but they do at least have after market sheet pans available out there that fit in them  if i d wanted to make cookies on pans that small  i d have expressed interest in a convection toaster oven to make 6 cookies at a time  not a convection microwave oven  it should also be noted the microwave oven owner s instructions   cooking guide makes a big deal out of you choosing the proper cookware  this is covered from pg 22 to pg 25  br    br   i was told by customer service  initially  that what i was looking for was available  and to contact parts about those last two questions  i did  i checked online and i called  the girl who answered actually hung up on me after i insisted that customer service had referred me and that indeed those parts should be available  after she ended our conversation abruptly  i brought the absence of those parts to the attention of the customer service rep i was chatting with  br    br   other than the above  the straight microwave function and straight convection function work well  the drop down oven style door is a really nice feature  the blue display lighting is pretty  br    br   how does a company make a product without giving the consumer  or providing to the consumer at an additional charge  adequate instruction or equipment to use their product  i just don t understand how someone puts out a product with 1000 uses and only reveals 20 of them  obviously people like me don t test them out or question the developers or designers or engineers before putting a product on the market without adequate instruction or equipment to use their product  br    br   obviously  my logic is lost on samsung   or it s too complex a logic for someone who works there to have figured out  in any case  with a hefty  249 on sale to  399 full retail price tag  the mc11h6033 1 1 cu ft counter top convection microwave with slim fry is definitely not worth the money since you can t use it to it s full potential  br    br   review update  br   so  as of christmas day  i still hadn t found a commercially available sheet pan that actually fit inside the unit  my mother gave me an old broiler pan that she had for a long gone oversized convection toaster oven  br    br   i was using just the convection oven feature on the unit for the first time  i d only used the slim fry feature to that point  to cook a dish for christmas dinner  all of a sudden it just stopped working  the unit head cut off and there was no display visible  i thought maybe i d tripped the breaker  i unplugged the unit and checked  i had not tripped the breaker  but i turned it off and back on just to be sure  i plug the unit back in and nothing  i ve been found something else to plug into that outlet so that i can make sure the outlet was in fact functioning correctly  it was  i then pulled out the owners manual and proceeded to the troubleshooting section  it recommended unplugging the unit for three seconds and plugging it back in  i unplugged it  and left it unplugged for a solid five minutes  i plugged it back in and still nothing  br    br   for a unit this expensive to conk out while using one of the features for the first time  definitely says nothing good about the unit  for the unit to conk out while making christmas dinner  that was just a headache i didn t need that day  i would dub this a completely unreliable unit  br    br   i regret that i never did have the chance to try french fries using the slim fry option  love my little microwave oven  good solution for a tight kitchen  slightly underpowered but works well  we ve had it and used it for over two years now  sep  12 to present  and it has worked fine the whole time   we don t slam the door or pull down on it and it seems to be holding up fine   we use it two to three times a day  br    br   like another reviewer said  you cannot cook while the timer is running  great range and matched my whirlpool stove perfectly   there was a little dent on the side  but it was not visible once it was installed   great br   buy and if needed in the future  i would purchase this item again   works fabulously and is very nice and easy to use  this is a very nice microwave   very easy to use with a great size to accommodate just about any item you need to prepare  works fast and i would highly recommend it it s a great microwave  easy to clean  although the add listed the unit as   34 used  34  it was in fact brand new and i am thrilled to my socks      it is installed in our motorhome and works like a charm  thank you thank you thank you  i liked the microwave  but it was damaged when i received it so i sent it back  nice microwave we loved this microwave  it had the perfect features  aesthetics and price  br    br   except it quit working  three  3  separate times  we have had to take off work three  3  times to wait for service technicians only to have the unit fail again   the issues began within the first five  5  months and have continued  br    br   the problem is that the unit will turn on  motor running  turntable turning  light on  but no heat is generated  food comes out at same temperature it went in  it has been the same issue each time the unit stopped working properly  br    br   most frustratingly  at my last call to amana  i pointed out that they have spent more in repair costs   400   than the original cost of the unit  in the interests of everyone s time  it seemed reasonable to try replacing the unit   i was told by jason and chris  supervisor  that amana s policy was to repair not replace  so only option was a fourth service call to report the problem  per policy   i asked chris whom i should direct concerns about this policy  and he said customer service  br    br   less than helpful  i was fairly certain that i was already speaking with customer service  i never was provided with an email address  physical address or alternate phone number to express concerns about the policy  bad business model  br    br   we are going to replace this unit with a samsung  one of consumer reports highly rated machines  yes  it cost a little more  but the amana has become excessively expensive in time and frustration  never again  works very well  happy with the purchase  perfect for what i needed  i love this microwave  exactly what we were looking for  it has been working great for several months now  it was perfect for our very limited space  a microwave box suspended below the cabinet and off the counter  it is quite a nice stainless steel look  complementing other appliances and black granite  this is a great microwave  this little microwave is almost perfect   i m having a kitchen remodel and didn t want to build in a microwave  which  let s face it  is mostly a giant water boiling machine   i got this little one to use during my remodel and i plan to use it once my kitchen s remodeled  too   the time goes up in increments of 30 seconds  1 minute  1 30  2 minutes  etc   i wondered if that would work for me  but it s just fine   i also found out  however  that the power goes up in increments 25  50  75  100  sometimes  i use my microwave to   34 soften  34  butter and i need the lower power of 10   if the microwave offered increments of 10  20  30  etc   it would be perfect   because it doesn t  i may have to take this one to work and get myself a different microwave for home  shipping was fast and the packing was supreme  easy to install  we are doing a remodel and i had my points to use  so happy i used them on this microwave  my other appliance are whirlpool and it looks great with everything  cvm1790ssss replaced our old caf  series microwave at no cost  within 5 years of purchase  as part of ge s   34 touchpad replacement program  34     kudos to ge for doing the right thing for that   br    br   pro s  br    touchpad completely redesigned  obviously less heat sensitive   br    inside is stainless vs  enamel like the old one   that is an obvious upgrade   for sure  br    the goofy tilt open top bar of the old unit is replaced with a fixed plate and top vents  br    shortcut buttons are more useful for us vs  the old set up  br    br   con s  would have given a 5 star except for   br    control panel redesign includes a dial   it is very easy to use  so only a con for being less attractive  br    handle is plastic covered with metal looking coating vs  real metal like the old unit   it seems very stout and the ge rep said the peeling was addressed this year  so we are hoping for the best  br    emblem is now black vs  the original red like all the other pieces in the caf  set  easy fix   below   br    br    we talked the installers into letting us keep the old emblem   the red emblem is held on by just 1 screw  easily removed    the red emblem cap  metal  was easily separated from the mount plug with a knife and affixed on top of the new black emblem with some gentle adhesive   an easy fix and no damage to the black emblem or stainless fascia  perfect size for my small kitchen   very attractive   easy to operate and performs well  worked great  this sharp drawer microwave is amazing   it has buttons to both open and close the drawer for you   we love the easy   34 top loading  34  system   plus          it looks great   we highly recommend this item  i thought i would wait to make sure everything was working correctly before i commented  the microwave is the perfect fit for my kitchen  it works exactly as expected and i was surprised a dinner plate fits too  it takes up a corner of my counter but it s very sharp looking   i ve had many compliments  i am a very satisfied customer  it is a great microwave   had to replace the one that came with the house  same model  since my boyfriend burned the inside of it   it is quick  quiet and i love all the features about it   easy to keep clean unless you date my boyfriend   then he will burn it one way or another so keep him out of the kitchen  it perfect for a studio or smaller kitchen  it fits a standard 10 5 inch ikea dinner plate just fine with space to spare  but anything much larger would probably not fit  br    br   power wise its fine  it takes 2 30 to 3 00 minutes to bring a mug of water to boil  and heats up my leftovers just fine  clean design and stable carousel that rotates 360 degrees as it cooks  one reviewer complained about an unstable carousel  but i think they forgot to install the circular runner that provides support on the periphery of the carousel glass plate  the runner is taped to the inside packaging with the owners manual  this turntable is exactly like the one that came with the microwave   the original cracked because my son dropped it  so found this one on amazon and it works fine  looks good  works well  does the microwave thing  venting is open at the top  though  things can fall in  that s a strange design  after 17 months there was a popping sound  and electrical smell and it died  we just warmed food up in it  no serious cooking  it is a great size and convenient  is it worth the price for a year and a half of service  it lost the high setting about 6 months ago but we didn t care too much  you might want to pass on this model  i have had mine for over a year and it is perfect  no one even notices it and it is using corner space i would not otherwise use  if trying to heat large amounts or use it a defroster or substitute oven then this might be too small for you  however  if you use a microwave for reheating food  cooking small amounts  popping popcorn and heating water it truly is perfect  what a great value  seemed to work fine in the house but didn t get along with my rv inverter   returned   bigger than most 700 watt units  br      handle sticks out quite a bit so not a   34 space saver  34   not as powerful as i hoped     no issues  i love the product  installed it for peb7226sfss  and it looked great  the only problem was the screws came with it  for mounting to the bracket   were too short  i went to hd purchased longer screws and screwed in perfectly  damn good clock but not a valid microwave  magnatron fried just like the other reviews  whirlpool should be called swirlpool because you are sending money down the drain when you purchase their products  this is a unique microwave in style and performance  br   it doesn t heat as high as most  but the size and shape is br   what sold me   it fits nicely into a corner of my counter  br   i don t use a microwave for much other than reheating br   things  so this for me is perfect   it is a very basic microwave  br   i really like that the light goes off after a bit if you leave the door open  this microwave has a very elegant design   the engineers were able to minimize its footprint by putting most of its electronics on the bottom instead of on the side   i would prefer green leds instead of blue  but mostly i m happy that it fits on our counter and under the cabinets without taking up much space  love it so far  when our microwave died   we decided to try to find one a little smaller   was slightly hesitant to buy this one as it is only 700 watts   my old one was 1100   but i really don t notice a lot of difference   have torun this one a little longer sometimes  30 seconds to 2 min longer     but this one disadvantage is more than made up for by the increased counter space that i have because this one is so much smaller  kitchen timer works well   haven t used the defrost setting because the 700 watts is so much less than my old microwave that something frozen does not cook  right away so the defrost setting is unnecessary   the clock works well and is easy to set   never used the clock on my old one as it was difficult to set   have not heard of this brand before  but i would certainly buy it again  the small size and the unique design with the rounded back are what i love about this microwave  unfortunately  the quality is just not great  the glass plate got a chip on it within the first week of using this  i ve never had that happen to me ever before with any other microwave  the plastic layer over the buttons has bubbled up and looks really cheap  if these two things were fixed i would give this 5 stars because it s just a perfect size  excellent product  saved our microwave  great item      a little noisy but works good  the microwave works great  i really like the fact that it has a little smaller outside dementions than similar microwaves of this power rating  one complaint  they offer 2 extra months of warrenty coverage  if you register online immediately  i did and they didn t give them to me  also  the coverage starts on the day of purchase not day of receipt from ups  amazon   the additional warranty i purchased from assurant solitions does start on the day of receipt   is cheaper than the warrranty from danby  i wonder why  product has not default but the weight is way too much for the size of the microwave  easy to use  could the weight has something to do with the power of the engine  only the technicians will be able to say something about it  but will definitely recommend it to whoever is looking for good but affordable microwave  outstanding for the prize  creates a perfect custom look  we have been using this microwave for a few weeks and so far are happy with our purchase  it was easy to install  looks nice  and is doing a fine job of heating up our food   we have no concerns at this time  very much enjoying this range  i used to have double wall ovens and a jenn air cooktop with grill griddle  we ve downsized but this oven gives me most of the benefits that i had with that setup  br    br   the small oven is perfect for 95  of the needs for my wife and i  but i do expect the large oven will get a work out at thanksgiving when we have at least 7 for dinner  the power boil is terrific  and the grill griddle is very handy and easy to clean  br    br   i debated quite a bit between this and the pgb950sefss  the main differences  br    br     this model has a porcelain top surface  the 950 is stainless br     the 950 has a double ring  19 000 btu boil burner   this has a single ring 17 000 btu br     the 950 has dual broiler burners  this has one broiler br     the 950 has a ball bearing roller rack  i believe just one of the three  where this has all standard slide racks br      700 msrp price difference br    br   to be honest i prefer the porcelain top surface of this oven aesthetically  but that s definitely a matter of opinion  the other features just didn t add up to  700 for me  i did use the broiler for a small frittata and that worked fine  but i can see how the double broiler could provide more even heat on a larger dish  the power boil is excellent on this  i don t see 10  higher btu making a tremendous difference  br    br   i also considered these other five burner double oven ranges  frigidaire fggf304dlf  kitchenaid hgrs505xss  lg ldg3036st  and whirlpool wgg7550bs   all have their benefits and drawbacks but the ge has the largest ovens and i got a good price through amazon  whirlpool   34 gold  34   i thought i was getting the   34 best  34  kitchen appliances   not     i have to press the clear button after every cycle to reset it  i also have to wait about 1 2 minutes  after every cycle  with the door open  for the light to come back on  or it will not reset   because it has been just over 1 year since purchase  whirlpool will do nothing for me other than refer me to one of their overpriced repair people   never again whirlpool    i bought this to replace my decades year old ge microwave   after reading all the reviews  this microwave convection was close to top with the added feature that it might actually work with the existing ge wall mount  it didn t   overall  this seems to be a nicely designed unit   i am using convection cooking all the time now  or even starting with microwave and ending with convection to warm things i won t nuke  br    br   it seems to me that a proper review would be done a year from now  and not before the plaster has dried  working well  good size and good price   i like this  ugh    i wished i had not purchased this microwave    the only good things about it is the rounded back to fit nicely in the corner of my counter  the 30 second quick start button  and having the light stay on while cooking    it s the weakest wattage microwave i ve ever had    having to relearn how to do simple things that take 1 1 2 times the amount of time to cook    i miss the traditional power level buttons and being able to key in 15 minutes instead of pressing the start button 30 times     i do not recommend this at all  worked perfectly  looks good   works well excellent product  i recommend it delivered in 2 days  a day ahead than promised  good product  many features and easy to use  i so wanted this small microwave to work   my plates fit  a small cup fits  but my normal coffee mug is too tall   the inside is only 5 5 inches high from the rotating plate  not 6 3 4  34  as the website describes   so my 6  34  coffee mug doesn t fit   returned  br   if whirlpool would make the same mike to hold 12  34  plates and a 7  34  mug  i would buy that   a little more power would be nice too  works great had unit professionally installed 2 year ago but it has a habit of turning itself on  had been doing that and latest episode is using it and it wouldn t go off  have to unplug it after every use until latest episode  this unit is unsafe and dangerous     jvm1540dmww  stay away from it    easy to use  great product i received this as a housewarming present  it fit perfectly in the space i had in my kitchen   it worked fine for several months no complaints  however a few times i discovered it would turn on by itself  it freaked me out but i d unplug it and then plug it back in the next time i needed to use it   after about a year the microwave started sparking inside the microwave from the side panel   at first i thought there was some metal in the microwave  but there wasn t and it happened a few times since   i was scarred to use it so i stopped and forgot to unplug it until it started turning on again by itself   i thought the thing was haunted  it really creeper me out   i eventually googled it and i now realize my mistake i should of returned it for repair earlier  this is a serious fire hazard   i did not purchase this one from amazon but it is the exact same model number and color   black and stainless steel    if your microwave turns on by itself unplug and return or replace asap   item had tarnished spots on it  not what i expected for the price  looks very cheap  product just isn t built to last  when buying these types of appliances best to get something you can unplug and replace   this product and company just do not hold up   equipment brand new 5 27 13  installed aug 13 stopped working 15 months later  great microwave and very fancy  but it does get hot when you used it  i usually leave it open for a few minutes when i finished using it  the item was fine  the price was great too compared other sellers  i bought this for my brother and he said it is great   great price point and it works really well  very pleased with my purchase  worked pretty well for a couple of years and then just made a popping noise and died  i guess i ll just buy cheaper ones from now on  mine caught on fire   the inner top service cover that is made out of plastic caught on fire  works great the danby 1100w microwave oven has proven to be the right purchase for my apartment  the unit is fairly compact given it s power rating  and because i have limited counter space size does matter to me  in my opinion the danby is an excellent product  and made in america    very good   videoid mobypru8yotebw  i bought this microwave recently  it seems to be noisy to me  either i got defective one  or it is normal for such microwaves  please listen the sound from the video  comments are welcome  i will update the review if it can be fixed  i bought this for an easy to use microwave for my elderly parents  they love it and use it way too much now  powerful for it s size  fits anywhere  especially above refrigerator   full disclosure  owned the previous model psa1201rss for two years  this model has a tsb out for peeling door handles  as one other reviewer wrote   however  their review is not for this improved model  if you have an advantium oven with the peeling door handle don t just order the handle   replace the whole door  it is a new handle design that addresses the problem  my door was replaced under warranty  br    br   bought a new house  miss our oven so much we re having one installed here  if you re considering one remember this  br    br   1  you cannot run it as a microwave with the metal tray and or racks in   it will dramatically shorten its life br   2  you cannot run it as an oven without the metal tray at least in   it will dramatically shorten its life  br   3  you cannot soak the control panel down with soapy water to clean it   you can short it out  you clean it simply by wiping with a microfiber cloth  done  br    br   all three of these points are in the owner s manual   which i m going to speculate a lot of people don t read  when i sold my last house i purposely put the owner s manual around all the racks outside of the oven and wrote a note to the new owner    34 do not use until you read   34  br    br   ok   rant over   here is the goods  br    br   this does almost everything  my fiance and i have used ours for  br    br   we have used it for proofing dough  as a warming oven  and we have used it for baking and cooking as a convection oven  it isn t quite a true second oven replacement  read on  but it provides completely even temperatures for baking so things like cookies  cakes  pies  etc  come out perfect every single time  br    br   you can program it to come on at a set time  cook for a set period  at a set temperature and then stop  br    br   the speed cook function is tremendous  it combines the microwave and halogen oven at the same time  because the microwave is used at reduced power  you can use the metal tray  not the racks  for speed cook mode  br    br   you can bake two large potatoes  crispy skin on the outside  cooking trick  brush with olive oil for crispy skin and sprinkle with kosher salt on the outside  in 13 minutes  they are fluffy inside  not microwaved   34 streamed  34  tasting  br    br   you can cook  reheat  frozen foods in 1 3 to 1 2 the time on the package  so frozen taquitos can be booked in 9 minutes instead of 27  you can bake crescent rolls in the can in about 1 2 the time you would in a conventional oven  crispy outside  flaky inside  br    br   there are hundreds of pre programmed cook settings for a wide range of food items and dishes  whether you re using it as a simple microwave to cook bacon  or you re using the speed cook function to roast meat  yes  you can even roast in it  br    br   the capacity for a microwave is huge  at 1 7 cubic feet  and if you re a family of 2 or 3  you ll probably find yourself using this for most of your baking needs  i rarely used our oven  br    br   so what can t it do  br    br   certain food types won t bake well using speed cook or the convection halogen cooking   that is why i say it isn t a perfect stand in for a second oven if you want 100  versatility  it can t broil  the 240 volt version apparently can   in addition we have found certain vegetables  like whole spaghetti squash  or a whole roasted cauliflower  won t cook properly in the oven  the insides never seem to heat up when used strictly as a conventional convection oven  as a microwave or speed cook no problem  br    br   we found this to be a huge time saver   and we just bought this unit for installation in our home  br    br   oh  and on the peeling handles   again that was the previous model  this model has the redesign and does not have that issue ok mode  br    br   you can bake two large potatoes  crispy skin on the outside  cooking trick  brush with olive oil for crispy skin and sprinkle with kosher salt on the outside  in 13 minutes  they are fluffy inside  not microwaved   34 streamed  34

br   oh  and on the peeling handles   again that was the previous model  this model has the redesign and does not have that issue  hard to beat for the price  bought this for a temporary living situation and couldn t ask for more for the price  as an older person the only improvement would be larger buttons for the start stop but that would add cost  cooks fast and is an excellent choice  great product for the money  looked large in the box  but fits nicely over the range   looks great and works great   has met all expectations and for a lot less than other microwaves for more  great price easy to use great for dorm rooms we have had this microwave for about 6 years now  the light button has just stopped working but everything else works on it still  br    br   pro after reading the manual we were able to type in a button combo that mutes the annoying beep  this was a nice feature to add in  it cooks fine and we are happy with it  br    br   con  minor inconvenience  when cooking popcorn  about 3 bags of it one after another  there is a thermal cutoff sensor that shuts the microwave off if it gets too hot  this is easily solved by just letting the microwave cool off or cooking bags of popcorn on a plate  br    br   this microwave is extremely cheap and if we have to  because it would cost more to replace the control panel light button than it would to replace the whole thing  we would probably buy it again  this is a beautiful microwave that happens to match all our other appliances  i bought it to replace a samsung that had burned out  it does an adequate job but the food  cooked for the same length of time is not as hot as with the samsung  each microwave had the same power but the samsung was more powerful  i should add that it was also more expensive  the whirlpool is a good buy  love this drawer microwave   we have kids and it is so easy for them to make popcorn or warm up their milk   besides that i am 5 2  34  and reaching traditional microwaves is always tough and impossible to clean without a stool   not with this one   so great  this is an excellent paint  follow the steps when painting and be sure that you do this in a well ventilated space  in all seriousness    shame on you ge  br   i purchased this microwave a little more than a year ago  and of course it is now out of warrantee  and thus falling apart    literally  br   the   34 metal  34  handle is not actually metal  it is cheap plastic with metallic looking tape on it  and the tape is peeling off  when i called ge they said   34 it s probably due to the heat from the stove below   34  i told them    34 it s an over the range microwave    it should not fall apart because of heat   34  to which they replied    34 sorry  new handle is  100 bucks plus another  100 for someone to come out and install it   34  br   i wish i could post a picture of the defective part here but the site doesn t allow me  br   after a lifetime of thinking ge was the go to brand for good quality products    this microwave will be the last ge appliance i ever buy  appliance was the right one to match my other appliances but did not work on power up  there is not a service tech that is backed by the company seller  so it had to be sent back  my money was refunded pronto but i would rather have the applince impressive for the price works great  quiet and powerful  opening the door is two handed sometimes but a good value  ugh the headaches   purchased 4 years ago and everyone seems to be having the same problems   mine was wonderful while it worked   then after 2 years the dreaded beeping  touchpad operating by itself  started happening   luckily i purchased the 5 year warranty   so out came the repair man   after much hemming and hawing  the door electronics needed replacement    550 00 and it worked again   fast forward to 2014  guess what  yep same problem starts again   touchpad not working  beeping  self activating all over again   so again trusty warranty comes in handy   out comes another repair man   yep hemming and hawing    another  550 00 for new door with electronics   this time the warranty company calls me   complaining they  just repaired 2 years ago   i explained these are happening to velos units all over the internet   they agreed to repair one more time  or refund my purchase price   ill have think on it    buyer beware everything is good so far  the price was low and i didn t know the brand  but took a chance  i have had no problmns  a very nice product  i especially like the night light  great   seems to be holding up just fine   i sanded and cleaned the area as directed and put on several coats  allowing the paint to dry in between coats  i finished it off with a light sanding using extra fine sand paper  the color is slightly off  but otherwise it looks and feels like new   i also have plenty left should i need to touch  great space saving option if kitchen area is tight   plenty of power to get small jobs done   we use it at a small cabin and it really saves a lot space in our small kitchen  this microwave was new to my home when i moved in  after 18 months  the door switch broke  which meant that any time the door was shut  the microwave spontaneously turned itself on  and didn t turn off until the door was opened   fortunately  this occurred while we were home    otherwise the microwave might have started a huge fire from continuously running empty  because  it was out of warranty  frigidaire customer service was ridiculously unhelpful  the representative told me that i would have to pay  150 00 just to send someone out to confirm what the problem was  and then pay for additional parts and labor to fix it  instead i ditched the piece of garbage and bought a samsung  i would never buy a frigidaire product again  p s  i also had a similar experience with my two year old frigidaire gas range  where the glass oven door spontaneously shattered while sitting idle  run fast and far from frigidaire  works great and saves space in our tiny kitchen   it s small though   cannot fit anything larger than a dinner plate or taller than a large coffee mug  exactly what i needed to repair my microwave at about a 1 4 of the price that most appliance parts retailers wanted  ok it  works very  well  it s easy to use  it  runs quieter then our old one   and  it heats and reheats everything we want  the only thing i notice is it s very  light weight  it tips easily  if you lean on it  this was rated fairly high by consumer reports  and usage over the past month or so has borne that out  it is roomy and it cooks fairly evenly and quickly  the basic controls are fairly intuitive  though apparently i have to set the power level before i set the cook time  rather than the other way around the way it was on my previous microwave  the special features  like the warm up with sensors that shuts off when the food starts to steam  are things that i don t seem to be able to get the hang of  after playing with the inverter defrost button and keypad  i was able to start using that in the cooking of certain frozen convenience items  i don t like the push button opener  i think that is what will break first  and then i won t be able to open the door  i do not regret the purchase so far  if the machine lasts ten years like the prior microwave it will have been a great purchase  i have a small kitchen  this fit perfectly in a corner on the counter  it looks super cute and i have received several compliments  it s small  and fits perfectly in a corner  microwaves things  i love my unit   have had it for years   very easy to operate   could have not purchased regular oven   this one does it all   would highly recommend  i just got it today  works great  just the right size  just the right price br    br   you could not get a better one for this price  not very big  fit into my small kitchen just fine  this little sucker has been heating up our food reliably for going on a year  it fit into a cabinet space that no other microwave could fit into  yeah  it s a little underpowered  but you get used to that  br    br   it fits a whole plate  which is nice  but sometimes if you have a larger item it will catch against the wall and not rotate  full size popcorn bags have this problem for example  br    br   but overall  great option if you need a microwave to fit into a very small space  arrived full of dents and broken exhaust mount  had to have ge repair come over and send a replacement   seller should have replaced unit but ge made it work out   oven seems like it will be okay but ge does have their problems   let s see if this one lasts longer than 3 years  the ge oven i replaced did not  when i broke the plate in my microwave i didn t know what to do  br    this was perfect and solved a huge problem  this is a good turntable place fo rmy microwave perfect fit  good never worked well  intermittently stops working   then starts again   i would have returned this in the first week  but once this monster is hung on the wall  and it s made its first bag of popcorn  who keeps the shipping box    it finally died after the fan would not turn off  now it s completely inert   the only bright side is it will fit in my community s garbage cans   this unit has been a frustration since installation  we purchased and installed this over the range microwave as a replacement for a 25 year old one   this is sharp is just perfect   we required one with the recirculating feature because we have no way to vent it  and this type is not easy to find  love this  microwave is not on the counter or looming over the stove  i ve had it a year now   no complaints  smooth opening and closing  nothing spills  i just received this   i was looking for the most compact microwave with the best reviews and this was it   so far  i tried boiling a cup of water and fixed a baked potato   it works just great   yes  i would recommend this  gets the job done and it was a great price  as advertised  compact  works great  figuring out how to warm without presets is kind of complicated  not impossible however  it fits nicely into the corner of the counter   doesn t take up as much counter space  but    it does not cook as fast as a large microwave but for popcorn and heating coffee it does just fine  family is so busy with working and kids  when old microwave died right after moving and expecting a baby  money was very tight  my mom saw our needs and purchased this microwave as a surprise   this little thing is just right for our smaller kitchen  it reheat foods fast and works great   family is very pleased  the person who designed this should have won a prize  makes the most of a small corner space and is more efficient  about 20  more efficient  great purchase  great for work i love this little microwave  it fits on my countertop easily and does not take up a lot of space  it is large enough to heat everything i use a microwave for   the controls are intuitive and easy to use  the high setting is only 700 watts which is less than the 1100 watts i was used to so cooking tends to take a bit longer   the only minor annoyance i have after several days of use is that i have to remove the turntable to fit my coffee cup in the oven   my cup measures 6  34  tall and is just a tad too tall to fit with the turntable in  however  i found if i remove the turntable and set the cup on the spindle that turns  it fits perfectly  27 trim kit isn t 27 inches  it s 26 and 1 2 so there was a 1 4 gap on both sides  would look nice if it fit purchased as a replacement for one that had been destroyed by a tenant who microwaved a plastic cup   the first one was a nice model   this one has served well  as well  i love love love it  i got rid of my previous huge  shrine to the microwave  cabinet  set this cute little one in the corner where it occupies counter space that s unusuable anyway and gained several valuable square feet of cabinet storage on my wall  it does everything it needs to perfectly  no keypad  no problem  it s small but who roasts a turkey in the microwave  it will still hold four ears of corn  a large round casserole dish  and plenty tall enough to do just about anything you want  i m sure i m saving energy too by not using my huge microwave to warm a half cup of coffee  get one  perfect worked so much better than i expected   two light coats and it looked like new  fast shipment  decent product   doesn t cook evenly  very well made with stainless interior  cooks well but has few bells and whistles  which is fine  four stars because visibility while cooking is not what i m used to   still a good deal for the price this microwave works well on a counter top   my previous microwave had a analog timer so i m obviously not too picky about microwaves   it should get the job done on most foods   the quality is a bit iffy though because the first one i received from amazon was half   34 caved in   34  literally   it s really lightweight and simple in design   a good inexpensive option for regular everyday heating  this is just adorable  not quite the power of my old and huge microwave oven   this one is sleek and small and very high tech looking   it tucks in under my kitchen countertop and in a corner  out of the way   i have to nuke things a bit longer with this one  but that s okay  wonderful product  my first time using anything like this for microwave repair of burned areas  i was not sure if it would work  but to my surprise it exceeded my expections  i highly reccomend this product  great item  good price   great quality  very nice add me to the list of the great disgruntled   ours stopped working after a year and 4 months  it heats food  but the turntable doesn t spin and you can t change  anything on the touch screen   stick the food in and it just hums  a fire waiting to happen  br    br   wish i would have read reviews here before i bought it   it was the pretty one the wife loved lol  people are being honest about this lemon   i did buy a square trade warranty after reading these reviews  lucky and square trade is being good about it  this stuff adheres well  dries quickly and leaves a washable surface   i used it to replace bubbling paint on a microwave with a painted mild steel lined cavity  cheap quality  br   but you always get what you pay for    love this product works fine this microwave cavity paint has worked out great so far   we have a ge in cabinet microwave oven combo unit so when the paint began to peel off the top of the microwave i was really worried because to replace this unit it is over  1000 due to it being a specialty item   so i sanded down the top of the microwave really well   be sure to get all loose paint off   should be totally smooth   then when the paint arrived i shook it up real well and applied a coat to the top of the microwave   it was actually a pretty good sized area i needed to cover   after letting that coat dry for a couple hours i added a second coat and after a couple more hours i added a third coat   i want to make sure it was coated good   so far we have used it for a few weeks and it still looks great   i showed it to my son and he said the inside looked brand new now   i let it dry for 36 hours before use as the can didn t have any recommendations or directions for how long to let dry before use   the smell is overwhelming and i would suggest using eye protection if you must use it inside as the fumes come out toward your face   i would take a counter top unit outside to treat   i didn t have that option so i had to just do it  love the microvave especially the prompts which makes initial usage inherently friendly and easy to navigate heats well we re very satisfied with it  i love this new little microwave  i had no room in my small kitchen  but i hardly know it s there  it takes up so little space  the only thing i don t like is  there are 2 removable separate plastic parts under the glass plate turn table  more parts to worry about should they ever get lost  the plate rests on one of the plastic parts  the turner with wheels  which makes the plate about 1 and a half inches higher than the bottom  which makes smaller space to fit tall items  there is no grove in the floor bottom in which the plate would normally sit  br   the whole unit is easy to clean  all  including the inside  is flat and smooth  no dials or protrusions  it has only a 30 second button  so must press the button 8 times to get 4 minutes  which perfectly heats a cup of coffee  the only easy cook button is for popcorn which only gives you 2 and a half minutes  i don t know why the manufacturer would choose   34 popcorn  34  when coffee tea is used much more often  this small microwave fits my big dinner plates easily  i am very happy with this product  so easy to use and clean  same as it was described  best part  i did not have to go anywhere  it came to my house right  on rime the quality and deliverry where very good but i returned it unused as it weighed too much and the rounded corners in the rear didnt fit my application  its a nice unit but didnt work for me  very well made and easy to install  great shipping on this bulky item  it s ok but not perfect   the  buttons  are hard to see in dim light and offer zero tactile feedback   it s way to easy to hit the 30 second button more than one time if you re not careful   i stuck some small felt adhesive pads over the buttons i use frequently  that helped quite a bit  you can find them in low light and when you press it you know it  love it  excellent   easy install  microwave works like new  even though it s a ge magnetron  it solved my frigidaire model plmv168cc1 over  the range microwave no heating problem  saved us of having to buy a new microwave  happy outcome    perfect for a small family home  dorm or guest house   although the controls are not conventional they are excellent once you understand them   the bottom slides too easily on counter tops every time you pull open the door  easily corrected by adding a pad or rubber feet   available at a big box store with blue logo for twenty bucks less  works great i was a little worried about the quality of this trim kit after reading previous reviews   but the thing is beautiful   my husband had to do some work to fit the thing in our space   the results were wonderful   and now i have a built in microwave in stainless steel to match my other newer appliances   the look is very nice  cute little m w  have been working good so far  no issues  good enough for a couple to warm up heat things in small quantity  takes a little more time  quite natural as its just 700 watts  but reasonable enough  overall  a nice buy  br    br   pros  easy to operate  many quick options  cute little and looks sturdy  a big space saver if you have small kitchen space  br   cons  none so far  br    br   overall  a no non sense simple m w for day to day use  serves the purpose      very roomy compared with my last one  its very quiet and heats well  so far so good  i bought this for my truck to use off of an inverter but it was so attractive and functional that the wife made off with it  overruled  it does look nice in the kitchen  fits great in the corner and looks good there  effiient spacious easy quiet fast doe what it supposed to do i purchased this for my office and am more than glad i did this is a perfect kitchen microwave  i am thrilled with it  great price for the value you get  must say i am very satisfied  i was looking for a very   34  small  34  microwave for my rv  this one is perfect and looks very nice   turntable fits an average size tv dinner  barely   it arrived in an amazon outer box  with just a couple wads of paper  thank goodness the regular packaging was done proper  tightly packed box from manufacturer   the amazon box was tore up  no markings to say    34 fragile   34  luckily it worked  it appears to function just the way it should  no issues  clean design  easy to read display  i would have gave it 5 stars  but a pass down the microwave aisle at the local walfart saw similar or even better values for price and size     although just a few dollars on price  i bought this micro to go on my boat because of its compact size and can fit into a corner   even rebuilt my cabinet on the boat to accomodate it  now i have found out it will not operate on an inverter i received this microwave and it didn t work  i plugged it in and tried several outlets  but the clock didn t light up and it didn t respond to me pushing any of the buttons  it was really easy to get a new one from amazon and they shipped it very quickly  so far  the second one has been great and exactly what i wanted  however  i had to return the first one that didn t work and the shipping methods were extremely inconvenient  ups will only pick it up from my house during the day when i m at work  i had to take it to the post office  but i don t have a car so i had to carry it and walk several blocks  in addition  the max shipping reimbursement wasn t enough  so i m out another  5 for their mistake  i got this for my new 1 1 apartment in the city   i m so in love with it      br    easy set up br    perfect for small spaces br    works amazing br    my coffee food gets super hot br    price is affordable better then the high priced ones br     stainless look  classic  easy clean up  br   i honestly don t have anything negative to say about it  i purchased this to repair my microwave and to save big bucks on a new one  it s been a while since i purchased it and it is still turning steady and strong great product super simple to use  no bells and whistles  and tiny  tiny footprint   works in my small kitchen  so i m happy with the purchase  i love this microwave  it is cool  works great  and frees up the counter  it fit seamlessly into the required hole listed in the specs  and if you want a range hood and not a microwave over the stove  this is the only way to go let me add to the list of unhappy customers  we have had this microwave for about 4 years  it first failed within the first year and was replaced by the manufacturer without any issues  they came to the house and installed a replacement  earlier this year some of the buttons on the control panel ceased to operate  i obtained a replacement panel and it worked ok for another month  then  it ceased to heat anything  i replaced a defective diode and it ran ok for a few more months  then yesterday while it was running i heard a poof and it shut down  probably blew the internal fuse   it also emitted an odor of something electrical overheating  br   this time i m throwing in the towel and will not attempt a repair  the id label indicates that it was manufactured june 2010  i would expect to get more than 4 years out of such an appliance  br   when it worked to did an ok job  but no better than the  50 counter top unit i keep on hand for when the main unit fails  br   this time around i ve ordered an lg and hope for better service  my wife called them and asked if they had a little time bomb inside   how else could the thing die right on time   the oven made the sound of shorting electricity  gave off a few whiffs of ozone  and that was it   the young girl at the other end of the call said that they may be able to look into getting us a new part  but we would have to pay for labor   i m not going to throw good money after bad   i m just not going to buy frigidaire items anymore  br    br   we have purchased the gallery stove and oven  which we absolutely love  and then we purchased the gallery microwave  which died   and we purchased the gallery dishwasher  which doesn t wash dishes    we also have a frigidaire furnace  that cracks me up every time   which works great  never realized how small 0 7 cu ft was going to be  but now i do  ah well  it works like it should  just don t expect to put a huge plate on their   quick touch buttons are the best  anywhere from 30 seconds to minutes with one touch please see above  am pleased with my choice  good value and works well so far   timer seems to work well  good booklet with directions  awesome product and delivery  microwave looks spanking new now  you cant find this product in stores lord only knows i hope i wont be diagnosed cancer in a couple of years as   result  i bought this in 2011  and it needed repair  outside of warranty  to the control panel in 2012  the control panel just died again  may 2014   and samsung won t help  they did offer a free diagnostic visit  but after i asked to speak to a supervisor  they withdrew the offer for the free diagnosis  chintzy product  poor customer service  prep surface carefully   be sure to leave no residue on surface to be painted   use multiple thin coats   allow sufficient time between coats for it to dry   the color matches my microwave very well  this product came super fast  and exactly as described  the only down side is that it doesn t get as hot as it should  i do live in korea and have to use a converter box  so that might be what s effecting it  other than that it is perfect  it works well  does everything i bought it for  easy to set  and operate  does take a while to warm up for baking  but operating on 110v it is to be expected very easy install to replace our 2001 version of this unit  able to retain the old mounting plate  plus all hanging screws  rear vent  and power cord lined up perfectly  a 10 minute change out of the old unit and install this unit  some features updated improved over the past thirteen years  only obvious design flaw is the faint grey almost invisible text on every control panel button  especially the start pause and cook time buttons  in its infinite wisdom  ge placed these two major buttons directly below the huge control panel knob  so they re always in shadow because no overhead light shines on them  would have made more sense to print the text in bright white like ge did on our profile slide in range  or maybe even back light the buttons  the old unit had a design flaw where the door s handle lower fastener broke off all the time requiring a service call and part replacement  this one has a stronger handle  but the buttons are very hard to see  if we had it to do over again  we d choose a different model brand  perfectly fit in my kitchen  and power is ok  it has everything i need for a basic microwave  i ve been using it for several days  haven t found any problem yet  cooling fan vents out of the front of unit   only vent fan opens exhaust louver   vent fan is manual only unlike implied in user guide   if manual vent not operated in conjunction with any cooking then possibility exists of damaging cabinets   strongly recommend getting a normal exhaust   vent fan and a countertop microwave  great product  have owned 4 sharp carousel microwaves over the past 30 years or so and they always stand out over other microwaves i have used at friends and families homes  the ease of use and guaranteed result is worth it every time  the microwave is stylish and easy to clean  the design has changed little in the 3 decades because it works and does not need changed  the size as well is perfect for cooking anything microwavable  having 1200 watts is a huge plus when cooking things like baked potatoes and frozen stuff that on a lesser powered microwave would take longer then posted times  but this oven will do the job in less time more often than not   it is a stylish powerhouse  i recommend this product because it works  rarely do you find a product that works as well as it says  read the instructions carefully and it will do the job  its a microwave and it works like a microwave  nothing fancy has the quick start buttons  was the cheapest 1000w one i found and i have no complaints  love it       i am happy with my  purchase br    and look forward to my next deal  br   keep the deals cinubg   lol arrived in two days instead of the week as reported  this was a great plus  it fit into the same spot as old sharp  another plus  the mounting brackets were in a different location   constructed less sturdy than the old ones  the medal was cheaply made   much thinner  overall i am happy with purchase  this is the perfect microwave for my household  it is basically used for heating water and food  couldn t ask for anything better  so  i needed a basic microwave  nothing fancy  let s face it  no kitchen can function can live with out one  don t know how the settlers survived lol  anyway  it arrived in about a week in perfect condition  and far exceeded my expectations  it looks just like the pic and even displays the time  and has a timer  it cooks very well also  over all yes  buy it  you won t be disappointed  this microwave is perfect for a compact kitchen  i have more counter space that is now useable than i had before  it s small foot print is a blessing  it is large enough to accommodate my needs  the interior is spacious enough to reheat dinners or a slice of pizza  i like making popcorn in it  would recommend this to anyone who has a small kitchen and is need of a unit with a smaller foot print  magnetron came quickly but the diode was not in the package as advertised  i do not want to install the magnetron without a new diode  small package  but large inside  it will fit a full size plate  perfect counter microwave  takes up very little space in the corner  we love it  we have had many comments on how cool it looks from friends  i was looking for a more compact microwave because i don t have a lot of counterspace   this works pretty good for that   the only thing i didn t like is that the cord is on the back right side instead of in the back middle   so i was unable to put the microwave in the spot i wanted because it wouldn t reach the outlet  nice small size for an out of the way spot on kitchenh shelve under counter   in opening and closing take great care as it easily l tips forward  i was torn between giving three and four stars   i bought this based on great reviews   while it s a basic unit  which is what i wanted  it seems to be lacking in a couple of areas   first  i didn t realize there were still microwaves that did not have instant on for one minute when you press 1  two minutes for 2  and so on   this doesn t do that   also  i knew it was big  but didn t realize it was going to be 2 inches taller and deeper than my old unit   it s almost to the point of looking too big for the space   yes  i could have measured since the dimensions are listed   my old oven had two lights underneath for lighting the range top   this has one small bulb  and seems a little inadequate   as others have said  i m not sure if i m sold on the upward facing vent   it makes the front look clean  but seems like a funnel for things to fall into it   the led readout is big and blue  and while it s not unattractive  blue lights are blurry to me  so it s harder to read than my old green readout  br    br   on the plus side  this is a nice big  powerful microwave  that looks nice in the space   it s got some nice touches  like a 30 minute fan off timer   since i wanted a basic unit at a good price  which this is  i went ahead and gave it four stars  this is pretty roomie  has plenty of power and fits just about anywhere   it looks like a tv though and is a bit loud  after our ge caf  microwave touchpad went out after only 3 years ge said it would cost  800 to fix   so we purchased this advantium oven   it shipped and would not heat up   we returned it but ended up getting a breville countertop for  299 that we like much better  we got this as a backup when our large microwave broke   it does a nice job and it s nice to have an extra one when more than one person wants to use it   the smaller size is really nice and doesn t take up a lot of space  i bought 3 of this  if you sand clean you microwave throughly  you only need to buy 2 to spray it worked great  works great   and really great size for cooking multiple items   easy to use without a lot of fancy buttons  i recommend this to others  but be sure of the size as this is a very large over the stove microwave  i love this  the cord is on the right  and short  i could have used the word on the left but other than that  because of my outlet location  it deserves a full 5 stars  it does reach to my outlet  but would have been nicer on the left for the location i have the microwave  other than that  i love this little microwave  i do have too cook things 30 60 seconds longer however  the space i save it worth the extra cooking time  heats up food  frozen vegetables  and makes small bagged popcorn perfectly  fits a full sized plate or paper plate  fits a 10  34  bowl about 5 inches high and that leaves some space too the top  this is not for cooking meals  small things only in my opinion and just what i needed and wanted  it is perfect for my needs for space   size is good and so far performance has been good the extra rack is a nice addition exact device needed to solve my ge microwave problem  my wife is happy now     so i can be happy too  this was an excellent shopping experience   i wish all my purchases could be made online with as little hassle as these  great shopping experience  people always ask what the hell is that thing parked on the fridge  its the perfect size for me to warm up a single dish or a coffee  i dont cook in a microwave  its functional and its beautiful  i really love this microwave   the design is modern and appealing and the function is ideal for application   i am very satisfied with having this product on my kitchen countertop  i use microwave just to rewarm my food  i barely use it to cook  the product is cheap and good for rewarming my food  i already used it for 2 months and have no problem  i don t know how long it is going to last  the product may also be good for cooking but i don t know since i don t cook with microwave  we needed a small microwave to fit in our newly refurbished 1995 vw eurovan camper  and this one is perfect  it fits inside an existing cupboard  i had been researching small microwaves for a couple of months and noticed that most of them only had a light on when the microwave was in use  but not when the door is opened  this one lights when the door is opened which was important to us since it s in a small space rather than a brightly lit kitchen  some reviewers complained that the glass plate didn t seem to fit or stay on the turntable mechanism  despite this microwave being a different brand that the two we have at home  the turntable mechanism is the same  and it only fits together in one specific position  when it s properly aligned it pops into place and is very stable  so many negative reviews on this site  i agonized over getting it  but it fits my space so i did   it works just fine and i m happy to recommend it if you re stuck with a cabinet space like me that will only fit this microwave  it is a decent microwave for regular use  easy to use and doesn t take up alot of counter space  also sits higher so it is easy to clean  a little shorter in height inside but it is just used for heating up food  not cooking a ham or turkey in it  we use these in our break rooms where they get conciderably more than use than they would in a home enviroment  they are a great product for the price we seem to get on average 3 years use out of them  the more expensive ones we tried lasted about the same amount of time  none available  purchased from amazon and was received within 5 days  exceptional    since it was the same model as my old one  installation was very easy with no new holes or brackets to install   so far it works very well and i consider it  at this point  an exceptional purchase  we have a ge oven microwave combo  the microwave has the oven controls on it  and the paint was coming off the microwave   i was concerned it was dangerous so i considered replacing the entire unit   then we heard about this paint and thought it was worth a try   my husband is quite handy so he did the sanding and spraying and the microwave looks brand new   couldn t be happier and it sure beat the price of replacing the unit  oven came quickly and well packaged and protected   gave it a try last night  i m in the middle of some inside renovation  and used the microwave to have something quick to eat  things i like about this oven   is the  pull to open door  and being able to heat food using 15 second increments   you can also adjust cooking times while the oven is in use  one other feature i really like is that the power cord is not ridiculously long   you can plug this oven in and not have the cord showing from behind the microwave  br    br   this is a very solid oven and am pleased with my  purchase though it is a bit higher than most models   curved design of the oven also makes cleaning quicker and easier  we were trying to find a microwave small enough to fit on the counter in our media room  but still large enough to make popcorn  and other things  this one fit the bill and it works great  we love it  overall  the appearance of this item looks great  however  i just installed this and there seems to be a problem with the drawer closing properly  essentially  when one uses the close button or attempts to close the drawer manually  it closes but then immediately reopens  i found a way around this until a service agent can come to fix it which is to hold it closed so it does not reopen  there is a little trick to it and it has to do with timing of when to hold it shut  i did warm up a biscuit in it and it worked beautifully  otherwise  it does what i bought it to do  boil water and heat leftovers  as stated in other reviews  it heats very unevenly  since i only plan on having this microwave for a year or a year and a half  i went into this purchase willing to put up with such an inconvenience  br    br   if you are looking for a good microwave  look elsewhere  if you are looking for a cheap microwave that will hold you over until you can buy something bigger and better  go ahead  this is a good little unit  i wanted something of smaller dimensions so i could put it into my rv  it fit perfectly  and it works just fine  very attractive and very quiet  it s taken a while to get used to the new controls  but that s just because they re different  not bad  i plan to buy another for a small trailer that i have  in short i would recommend this to anybody  its not working for what i buy this  but use in my home kitchen  looks nice  easy for who not use so much microwave  want for my husband in freightliner on road  have hot food we purchased this microwave at the suggestion of our kitchen designer  we had totally renovated our 1930 s home and space was an issue   especially in the kitchen  i m so glad we spent the    and bought it  this microwave survived abuse from 2 little boys  pulling and pushing on the drawer to watch it move by itself  pressing the buttons  etc   countless interior spills and multiple uses each day  it popped bagged microwave popcorn better than any other microwave i ve ever owned and boiled water faster than on my viking gas range  we recently moved and now i m replacing the microwave in our new house with the exact same model as our old one  can t say enough good things about it  received this microwave   the first time we tried to use it the top and the sides got extremely hot and it shut off    it now has no power at all   i will be returning this and not purchasing a new one  this product was easy to use and when the paint dried   the paint blended in and match the original inside paint perfectly  purchased this     good for the price can t complain   i would recommend this to a friend if you need a simple small microwave   great item    it fits it perfectly  i really enjoyed getting this item  i definitely recommend anyone to purchase this item  i wasn t sure what component broke in my microwave   a ge spacesaver xl1800   it would actually run  just would not heat the food  br    br   from extensive research  i figured out which components  when broken  would allow my microwave to run but just not heat   the list below is from the most likely to least likely cause of the problem  br    br   1  diode br   2  magnetron   many times  1    2 happen together  br   3  capacitor br   4  high voltage regulator br   5  control circuit board br    br   90   of the time it is  1 or  2 and most likely both  br    br   for me  it was both  br    br   when i ordered the above diode i tested it with an ohm  volt  meter and a 9v batter   the original had current both ways   the new one allowed current only one way   that s the correct result  br    br   tests on my old and new magnetrons with the ohm meter had the same results  no battery needed for this    both tests read as a closed circuit  or 0 00 on my ohm meter    so i wasn t sure if the original magnetron was actually broken or not  br    br   so to check this  i kept the old magnetron installed and just installed the new diode  plenty videos on youtube on this   br    br   no heat  problem not fixed  br    br   so then i replaced the magnetron and kept the new diode in place  new magnetron   new diode  br    br   success     my microwave works  yay  br    br   hope this helps  br    br   ps   i ended up getting the an exact copy of the above samsung om75p 10  magnetron for  52  total final price on another site  br    br   pss   consider replacing the halogen internal light bulb while you have the microwave apart  in my kitchen there is a wall directly to the left of the microwave space  the microwave i had before  a ge  worked fine  but the whirlpool is hinged differently so that there needs to be more clearance to the left  i guess it is expected there are shallow cabinets on each side but in my case there s a wall so since the whirlpool is hinged so the door requires more clearance  it does not fit  nowhere in the specifications did i see that it requires more than an inch clearance to the left and cannot be installed with a wall to the left  my turn table would not turn i ordered this part and put it in and the microwave is as good as new  i had a ring of rust and metal on the bottom of my microwave oven   my husband just wanted to buy a new oven but i had already ordered this product   i worked great   i followed direction i found online and my oven is like new again  this was a replacement and the fit and quality was perfect   i would recommend the product to anyone needing a replacement although they look pretty  we will also never buy another frigidaire product  bought a package from another retailer at a reasonable price for what we thought were top of the line frigidaire products  in less than two years both the microwave and dishwasher needed major repair within a week of one another     the micro for  240 and the dishwasher for  350   repairman recommended we chalk both up as a loss and replace with a different brand as he has seen lots of problems with the frigidaire product   recommend to buyers that you spend a little more upfront because you will save in the end  it is listed as stainless steel  but a magnet stuck tight to it   this is not typical of stainless not this much attraction   research through  google showed some stainless is magnetic   i knew this  but the attraction seemed too strong was this a stainless steel coating over iron i do not know  br    br   the microwave has worked very well for me  i have no complaints  br   caution  some cleaners can pit s s  amonia should never be used on stainles   if if it was a s s  coating and a pit goes to  to the iron  br    br   my experience has been with microwaves that have the white enamel coating inside   the coating starts to seperate  from the metal shell and fall into your food   you remove it until it is almost all gone  leaving the exposed metal shell to rust   this has happened to me several times  br    br   i am very pleased with the danby designer from amazon  she who must be obeyed was ready to throw the microwave out as the interior was beginning to flake   a little sand paper and paint and she welcomed it back into her kitchen   it feels good to go one up on this disposable society  i bought this microwave for my college dorm room and their isn t a day that goes by that i regret it  br    br   this microwave is relatively quiet and very easy to clean  it is also the perfect amount of watts to keep the university off my back  this microwave is pretty good and very quite  i love the way it looks in the kitchen  however  that being said the reason i am not happy with this item completely is because of the way it was packaged when shipped  they don t box this item right and the corners are all exposed during shipping by the time i got it it was all warped and dented  luckily it was on the side that you cant see when installed and nothing was damaged except for the optional vent part that came with it  also  the install directions are very confusing    the light on the clock does not stay lit when micro not in use   when the door opens and shuts  the liquid in a cup or whatever may spill   also when reheating coffee from 7 11 it tips over  i scraped and cleaned the area really we ll as per instructions  but found that the paint started to peel again after three weeks our lg lmv1683st just caught fire too  br   making popcorn like we have countless times before  happened to walk past and noticed flames coming from the roof vent  br   luckily we caught it early so were able to put out the flames without too much drama  br   i called lg and the earliest they can get someone out is next monday  today is tuesday    actually  i was surprised that the customer service rep didn t express any concern whatsoever about us having a fire in our kitchen  no big deal i guess  br   and  i have to add that it is vented correctly  i double checked that   installed above the stove and room vented  br   we purchased ours may 2013  it s now march 2014 so it had better still be under warranty   to be honest  i m now very uneasy at the thought of getting another one of these  i d never trust it again   thats something i ll be talking to them about after the service tech comes out  br    br   note added 16 3 14   i also reviewed microwave on lowes com last week but it was not published  presumably they delete any negative reviews   will never trust that site again  after all  it was the positive reviews on that site that made me buy the thing in the first place  br    br   update 17 3 14   service tech came out and said it was the fan cover that caught fire   the second one he s seen in this area in the past 2 weeks   luckily   we were able to stop the flames before it melted anything but the fan cover itself   so they are just replacing the fan cover   assured me it is a different model though   they also told me that it happened because we were cooking popcorn  in a microwave popcorn popper  and it was too close to the ceiling   but  we ve used the exact same bowl in 3 different brands of microwaves over the past 10 years without a problem  so i just don t get it  br   to my dismay  they didn t care about the burn marks on the ceiling of the microwave either   sure  it s not a large area  but it s still really noticeable   just told me i should be able to get it off with bleach   which didn t work  or to go out and buy myself some touch up paint  br   so there you go  up to you if you want to risk buying this model   i m not happy at having brown burn marks on the ceiling of a less than 1 year old microwave but their attitude is that it s my problem  not theirs  this will fit in a small place and has room for a full size dinner plate  it is very sturdy and well made  you could go to walmart and get a 40 dollar microwave and that might fit the bill  but this will last  we bought this for our kitchen remodel to fit in the island in july 2012   i don t like having the micro over the stove because i do a lot of canning and wanted a great range hood   the heat from canning tends to melt the electronics in micros over the stove after about a few seasons  br   once it was in  i was never completely happy because it took a long time to reheat food and didn t seem to reheat evenly   not a big deal since we only used it for leftovers    and it looked good tucked away under the counter  br   when i bought it  i couldn  t find many reviews on it   good or bad  but figured it would be fine especially with the high price tag  br   wrong  br   it just died with no warning   our  199 over the stove micros lasted longer   i could have melted 4 or 5 of those for the price of this one  br   i m going to try to fix it because now i have a custom island built to fit this specific microwave   save your money  buy a countertop model and whatever you do   do not build cabinetry to fit this piece of junk  br    br   update  i was able to have this fixed by a local guy   apparently there was some bad circuitry that he was able to replace  glad i don t have to find a new microwave to fit the space  but i still wouldn t recommend it   who knows when it will break again  my wife does 90  of the cooking in our home and i asked her what she thought of our new ge cafe series csa1201rss 1 7 cu  ft  over the range advantium speed oven   microwave and she said    34 i love it  i may never use our regular  range  oven again  34   i use it for the usual things that most men use it for  popcorn  heating coffee  warming left overs and the like and for me  i think it is also great  it reheats just about anything i have tried to just the right temperature  if there are any cons with this appliance  i haven t run across them yet  ordered because my turntable inexplicably shattered after 5 years  this replacement was listed for my model number  perfect fir  great price  no problems  be purchased all bosch appliances in 2011  br    br   refrigerator went out twice  it was past warranty so bosch would not cover  then we found out it was covered through the good housekeeping seal of approval  once we got them involved it was eventually repaired then replaced after more and more problems  br    br   now microwave   hmv 3051  completely died  only 2 5 years old with moderate use  bosch will not help and unfortunately it does not have good housekeeping seal  we will replace with non bosch model that does my microwave was rusting out badly and it is an undercabinet attached microwave   i didn t want to have to buy a new one to fit in that small spot and i didn t want to have to remove the microwave to paint it   so in a couple of hours  i cleaned the microwave  directions online   covered all surfaces from overspray  and used this paint   now i have a new microwave and i keep a clean sock filled with rice in it when it is not being used   the rice absorbs the moisture so the microwave won t rust again   i am very happy  we ve had this convection oven now for about 2 years and while we are pretty happy with the microwave portion  the convection feature is not satisfactory  because of the smaller volume compared to a regular range you would assume that the oven heats up faster or doesn t even need to preheat at all  as we were used to with our previous model from kitchenaid  but this model takes actually about twice as long as our regular oven and therefore we hardly use the convection feature  so if you are looking for a good convection oven  this is not it  i have a small kitchen and my old microwave was a full sized microwave that took up a large amount of cabinet space and seemed out of place because of its size   shopped around and found this smaller sized unit but was hesitant because it is 700 watts while my old unit was 1000 watts   however  i have found that cooking time in this unit is insignificantly longer than the old microwave   a few second for most things   i don t actually cook in it but use it for warming left overs or frozen snacks  etc   for my use it is perfect and it is an attractive addition to my kitchen rather than a huge distraction   if you need a smaller sized microwave  i highly recommend this one  really enjoyed the drawer type microwave and the auto open feature is a plus  br   comes with full warranty even though is is a refurbished model  everything works perfectly  after several months of using  it looks great and it is pretty smart  however  i am annoyed by continuous error beeps  we had this for less than 2 years and the door handle fell off  it is held onto the microwave door with cheap plastic parts  i bought this microwave to fit into a cabinet  so the measurments were most important to me  other than that  it has everything i want in a microwave oven  full size to fit big plates  the carousel works great  easy controls  several one push buttons for 1min  2min  3min  even a 30 sec button  readouts  are very bright and easy to see  the only problem is the cabinet  when i got this via ups  it was packed inside of a plain brown box  inside that box was the box that the microwave was shipped in  in that box was a full surround of think styrofoam blocks along with some plastic and paperwork  when i took it out of all the wrapping  the cabinet was loaded with dents and one side was slightly collapsed  i don t know how this could have happened unless it was done before shipping  but  why would they ship something they knew was so beat up  the only reason i can think of is      people buy them to put in cabinets like i did  i paid 99 00  great working microwave  terrible cabinet  i was going to say despite its size  this is a wonderful microwave  but then i think the small size is the best part   i bought it for my small kitchen  and it s not only adorable  it s a kick ass machine   love it  part is as described  arrived in a timely fashion  installation was easy  direct replacement for the magnetron in our 10 year old ge spacemaker  microwave is working again  i was going to replace the microwave  checked it out and found it was the magnetron  ordered this  delivered fast  fixed it for under a 100 bucks  this microwave is great for portability and also defrosts meats well without over doing it  br   it looks good in the kitchen and is good for basic use as long as your not in a hurry  br   it has no power compared to a full size one  br   what takes 30 seconds in my old panasonic takes 1 1 2 minutes in this one  thats reheating a cup of coffee  br   we keep the old micro plugged in  in the basement if we need larger things heated quicker and to be hot  br   reheating leftovers takes much longer  point being if your into getting things heated quickly this is not the microwave for you  br   it has an annoying beep that continuously goes off about every 30 seconds after something has been heated until you open the door  like you need to be reminded  just another electronic noise nobody needs  br   its expensive for what you get  you are paying for portability  nice looking microwave but has many problems  lasted exactly 3 years then i had to replace  since it is an over the range model that means you may be cooking things under it on the range that create steam  when the steam rises it gets into the electronics of the keyboard and shorts it out  replaced the keyboard at 2 yrs  forgot cost but was not cheap  and finally it has finally died  poorly designed  do not recommend  i ve only had this for less than a month and  full disclosure  i didn t purchase it from amazon but got the exact same model from best buy  i should have read the reviews here first before it was installed       the good   it looks nice  the stainless steel finish must have some kind of coating on it because it s much easier to clean than some of my other steel appliances  the overall size is decent on the inside   when it s cooking  i have to say this is the quietest microwave i ve ever owned     the not so good   i ve never had an over the range microwave with the handle on the door before and i hadn t really given that feature much thought before making the purchase   it looks nice and all  but the handle gets untouchably hot if you re cooking on the stove   i don t think i d ever buy another with a handle again because it s kind of a nuisance to have to use an oven mitt to open the microwave  even more of a nuisance if i forget to use a mitt and put my hand on hot stainless steel    it s very hard to see inside of when food is cooking   there s one bulb and it s quite dim  plus the door has a screen printed pattern on it that makes it even harder to see into   the exhaust fan for the range technically has two settings  but they sound almost identical    and it s very loud  if the microwave is running for a long period of time or if it starts getting overheated from the stove below  the fan automatically turns on   it s a smart feature to prevent it from overheating  but again the fan is super loud  and you can t manually turn it off once it kicks on     the bad   oh  my  god   the freakin  beeps when it s done cooking are insane   i ve never  ever had a microwave that didn t stop beeping upon the door being opened   not only does this continue  but the 3 beeps are extremely loud and at least 5 6 seconds long each   and if you don t open the door in a timely fashion  it doesn t remind you with a gentle  short beep   instead you get the same 3 ear shattering yokoono screeching beeps every 2 minutes   i ve found that if you hit the stop cancel button before opening the door  it ll stop the beeping    but again  it s another nuisance that i ve never had to deal with in any previous microwaves     the other bad thing i ve found is that the touch pad scratches extremely easily   i only use a microfiber cloth on it and it still looks like i went at it with steel wool covered in broken glass   i tried using a plastic fiberglass polish and it didn t do a thing   however  i ve found that using granite countertop cleaner polish at least minimizes the look of the scratches a bit     overall  i d advise people against purchasing this model   its negatives outweigh the positives    especially when there are so many other  better choices out there  i really thought our built in microwave was going to have to be replaced  because of the paint pealing away and rust forming where exposed   to my amazement this inexpensive product solved my problem with ease   remember to have area well vented to the outside and to use a mask   by using many light sprays you will prevent runs  i ve just had this microwave installed in my new kitchen  i wanted to find one that could go in my island and wouldn t  detract from my new cabinets  it s easy to use and is a great addition to my new kitchen  the parts were just what was needed  they were the correct part as identified  there was no variations and therefore installed just like the parts that were removed  have been working just fine since installed  this microwave oven was purchased for work   everbody likes it   never have any problems   would purchase the same kind next time  works  great shipping everthing was good looks really nice above the oven with the microwave if we could a microwave that worked to go with it we bought this for a new construction and haven t used it yet  it looks great and hope it works just as well  this review is as much for this product as is for consumer reports  bought all new appliances for a new cabin we built and used consumer reports recommendation to buy these appliances  this was one these purchases and was given an excellent review by the consumer reports people    br    br   lasted just over a year and quit working  ge wants  75 just to look at it before telling me how much in parts and labor they will charge me to repair it  i can buy another company s 2 2 cu  ft  stainless steel countertop microwave for  89 today brand new with full warranty  ah   no thanks  br    br   my old 29 year old panasonic is still working great and heats food just as well as this one if not better  i think i ll take my own advice now instead of consumer reports and buy another panasonic  br    br   update  found out the inverter board is bad   ge wants  250 for a new part    75 service trip charge and another  75 for repair    400 total repair cost for a microwave oven just over a year old when one of these brand new is just under  300    the microwave is really ok as for the price  if you don t need to have a  fancy   big microwave and you use it basically just to warm up dishes   it s perfect  br   i tried also to thaw meat there or prepare popcorn   it also works well  br   cons  a little bit noisy when it s ending preparation  popcorn button doesn t work well   program need to be chosen repeated to make sure popcorn is popped br   pros  easy to use  small  built in kitchen timer  cheap this microwave is excellent for the small household and the person who does not do complex cooking   it s full plate size  fine for heat ups and smaller casserole dishes   best of all is the way it fits into a corner   yes it takes up space  is not   34 tiny  34  but fits under cabinets and leaves you more counter space   controls are easy to set   haven t had a microwave in years  and somebody suggested this   i m happy with it  among the other problems mentioned  the glass panel in the door shatters when the convection oven goes over 400 degrees  and don t even think about installing a new door yourself  as ge insists only their repair people can do the work for  150 plus the cost of the door  zero stars would be totally appropriate  good unit br   easy to install as i  was replacing old unit br   color was as expected it to be when opened the door has a huge dent in it  makes me suspicious of how   34 new  34  the product is or if it is a factory second or something  returned by another purchaser  this small microwave does everything you need even without lots of bells and whistles   it fits a corner if necessary and does as good a job as a larger microwave   it s easy to clean   i m so pleased with my decision  purchased this microwave for my husband s semi truck   it would not run on the large inverter installed in the truck   fought with it for several days until i decided it would work great here at home    i love that it takes up so little room on my counter   it s perfect for the one or two person household   i love the microwave but their answer to how do you clean the glass door was  cover your food and you shouldn t have to clean it  i always cover my food yet sometimes the saran wrap breaks and things splatter  how you could put a fine grate between the food and the glass and expect food not to splatter is beyond me  samsung  makes great tv s and electronics  but stay away from appliances as they obviously do not have a clue  in the meantime  i paid top dollar for what i thought was a great product  little did i know i m now stuck with something that makes me look like i m a total slob in my kitchen  thanks samsung  this microwave is simple to use  and it works great   at first i was a little apprehensive about the matt finish on it but once we got it installed  it looks great   i love it   my husband and i installed it   we only needed a basic drill  it took a couple of hours but we got it done  love this microwave  it heats food   drink up fast  i love love love the compact size  counter top clutter is one of my pet peeves so this definitely opens up some counter space  it s so cute too  just needed for a touch up br   but works great   will keep br   on hand if see another chip br   to be fixed this microwave isn t perfect but it s perfect for me  some folks would think it s a little loud  both while running and the beeper  it takes a little longer to heat than larger units but that s to be expected  those are minor issues for me  it s just the right size and fits nicely in the dead space of a corner  has freed up counter top space  it heats frozen food just fine and that s all i use it for  if i were asked what needs improving  i d like to be able to key in the heating time rather than push the button up and down  and backlighting for the buttons  overall  it fits my needs  my unit arrived quickly and in good order   took just a little time for my wife and i to mount this on the wall  the instructions were adequate for setting up the mounts etc  br    br   been working perfectly  can t think of anything to complain about except there was another reviewer who commented on a design flaw of there being no proper cover to the exhaust vent on top  small items could fall into this area   i would agree with them  though in my case there s nothing above that would fall into it  we ve had the big  ol   34 over the range massive ge microwave that was powerful enough to cook a buffalo and was big enough to fit the beast inside but  when we redesigned our kitchen and put in a new pro style stove and an elegant curved glass vent over it  that oversized radar box had to go  but what to get to replace it  looked at all the allegedly compact countertop units and rejected every one of them      34 compact  34  they were not  br    br   and then we found this whirlpool tv set  er  i mean microwave  whomever designed this deserves a nobel prize for peace  physics and common sense   it looks just like a cute little old school tv set  imagine that  a cute microwave oven  but what s even better is how this thing disappears right into the corner of our new countertop  somehow they figured out how to use the corner to their design advantage and here s the best  you can place a full size 11  34  dinner plate inside  how d they do that     br    br   negatives  nothing terrible  yes  it s only 750 watts vs the 1200 of our former   34 beast master  34  machine but  as another reviewer said  just  cause it fits a turkey and has the power to cook it doesn t mean ya should   we use our microwave for vegetables  eggs  liquids  popcorn    all of which the new cute whirlpool tv microwave thingee will do just fine  takes an extra 15 30 seconds because of the lower power  that just gives me a little extra time to stare at this awesome box and marvel at how truly cool it is  br    br   and speaking of boxes  this is serious out of the box thinking about appliances and how they fit into our lifestyles  major kudos to whirlpool for taking the initiative to see things a little different  steve jobs would have loved this microwave    form and style perfectly matched with function  it s time for you other lazy manufacturers to up your game  br    br   bottom line  outstanding microwave  made my 2005 manufactured ge spacemaker xl1800 work like new  man  there are a lot of different shells for the xl1800 depending on the year it was made    there was a small round diode like item attached with 2 screws to the side of the original unit and not on the replacement  simply moving this to the same location on the replacement and connecting things back up did the trick  i also replaced the small included diode that connects to the capacitor   why not  it was there  br    br   the whole deal took 2 1 2 hours start to finish   including remounting the unit above the range and going over to a neighbor  thanks neighbor   to get help removing and remounting the microwave  lots of videos on the web to help you along the way  be patient and keep track of your screws  we initially were happy with our purchase of this microwave  although it did not have the features of the older  more expensive dacor microwave it replaced   the size was great  and we liked the easy clean interior  br    br   however  six months after it was purchased  right before christmas   it failed totally   would not power up at all   i called samsung customer service  they said a tech would get in touch shortly   after 3 days a local repair company called to say they only came to our area once a week  so it would be several days before they could stop by   we re 30 miles from salt lake city in park city  a major resort town with a winter population of 100 000 people  so it s not like we re in the sticks  br    br   nine days after i called  the repair service showed up   he repaired one part  then stated that the magnetron was damaged  and that he would need to take the microwave to his shop for more diagnosis and repair   then he would have to order parts  then he would bring it back when his route brought him to our area again   so  two more weeks at least  assuming samsung has the parts in stock    on the way out of the door he banged the microwave into our door frame  putting a major dent in it  br    br   i called samsung customer service again  and stated that i thought three weeks or more was too long to repair the unit   they blamed the tech for not bringing all the parts he might need  what  a whole microwave   but refused to offer to even expedite parts to the repair shop to cut a week off the time  let alone discuss any kind of replacement  br    br   with a family of 5  we use a microwave multiple times a day   samsung should have better quality in the first place   when they have a failure  they need to have a better repair and support system in place  and if they can t do better than 3 weeks or more to repair an appliance that gets used daily  that s not good enough for me   do you need a failure like this right before you have family coming for the holidays  would you be happy to spend weeks with a giant empty space in your kitchen where your microwave  and oven hood  was  br    br   we don t  no more samsung appliances for us   and good luck to samsung in taking on whirlpool  bosch  asko  panasonic  etc    the other appliances we have in our house which have worked great with daily use for years   i m off to the store for another brand of microwave  look for this one on ebay   still under warranty  br    br   by the way  we tried to post a version of this review  edited in accordance with samsung com s review guidelines  on samsung com  where samsung supposedly allows customers to rate their products  and this microwave currently has a 4 star review    we received a notice today that they would not post our review  no rationale  only that it did not meet their standards  buyer beware  just bought house with this unit in the house  br    br   it looks good   the controls are awkward  the timer and fast button controls are not intuitive  br    br   however  it worked fine  has light under it and fan that works ok  br    br   my wife cooks popcorn init and it flames up  my wife throws the now burning popcorn bag in the sink and we clean it up   the unit fails to start at all  br    br   i have never had anything flame in a microwave  especially with no metal or tin foil at all involved  and fear replacing with the same brand  so looking at other  br    br   i definately would steer clear of these units as they seem to have multiplel issues  this is a great product  fixed my microwave like it was brand new  i would highly recommend it to anyone who has some paint chipping off the sides or top of their microwave this is a great microwave combination convection oven  the knob dial is actually very nice and initially was hesitant about getting it because of that  but now my wife and i truly love it all the feturers of the big microwaves in a compact size br   the handle makes it easy to open without spilling food this microwave looks great and i really like the   34 30 second  34  feature  it also has a unique footprint that works well for kitchens with limited counterspace  but for  150  it should have lasted longer than 14 months  after 6 months  it started making a very labored noise after being on for more than about a minute  at 14 months  it caught on fire while i was trying to warm up a cup of coffee  for my next microwave  i will buy something that looks less sexy  for less money  and hope that it will be more durable  we needed a small microwave when we moved into a small condo with very little counter space  most of the reviews said this was the perfect solution and it is  it takes up very little room  plus it fits easily into a corner  it has a rotating glass tray that holds a standard size dinner plate  it s tall enough to fit a 16 ounce mug with room to spare  but it is shorter than many standard microwaves  it has digital controls that are very simple but work just fine  we re older and actually really appreciate that simplicity  some things take longer to cook but not by much  br   if you want all the bells and whistles and to be able to zap things quickly  this is not the microwave for you  on the other hand  if you need a smaller microwave that is easy to use and very sturdy i definitely recommend this one  we love it  after using the microwave for 1 week  it stopped working   i just sent it back and waiting for a replacement   i will give sharp 1 more chance  we needed a microwave that was not very deep and a bit wider to fit in our cabinet  we struggled to find the right dimensions for our built in cabinet cubby  this one is a perfect fit  i was concerned it would not be powerful enough since the watts are lower than many others  so far it has worked great for our needs  plus it looks great in the space  we don t use a microwave all that much and didn t want to invest counter space in one  br    br   with a teenager who is now heating things up for himself  it made sense to get one and this small footprint model seemed to be a good fit   it handles our largest dinner plate and seems to heat things well   it is s little taller than it looks in the picture  but it fits our family s needs quite well  we needed to create a little more space on the kitchen counter and this unit was perfect   nice looking machine and tucks into a corner   would recommend to others  bigger than previous microwave   larger form factor  had to do some work to retro fit and replace previous microwave  br   easy to use  works well  heats food evenly  chosen for it s size  this microwave is pretty perfect for us  we use it for simple warm ups and reheating  it works great  br    br   it is surprisingly very heavy  arrived very well packaged  br    br   i love how it sits back in the corner of the counter with the curved back  i understand there are instructions you can enter to turn the beep off  but then i d probably forget food is in there   when the food is done it immediately starts an obnoxious beep and continues to do so with 20 second breaks   if the beeping started two minutes after something was cooked i d be okay with it since most instructions say to let food sit for two minutes after cooking   we have to take food out right away to stop the beeping  or open the door and let it sit with the light on   just a poor design in that way   seems to cook normally and looks good   still running okay after about 18 months   i came on here thinking if prices had dropped i d buy a spare  i figure they all die after 5 10 years and they are a pain to match in looks  but after reading the reviews will save my money til i really need one and buy something else  we needed this size and the danby works   the controls are a little quirky  you have to put a   34 0  34  in front of the timer to set minutes but not all the time     took some getting used to   the only real design flaw is that  unlike most microwaves where you push a button and the door pops open  you have to pull the handle on this one   and the machine is so small and light that you need two hand to open the door or the whole thing moves around and doesn t open   this can be a pain   but if you need this size  the cooking is fine  this microwave will fulfill my needs at this time   i am well pleased with the wattage of this microwave  this microwave replaced one with much less wattage  okay  it s not the most powerful thing ever  and there are a few things i would change about the design  but this little thing handles all my microwave needs and has freed up a significant amount of precious counter space in my very cramped kitchen  this is an excellent microwave and very big   i am so very pleased with this product   i think it is the favorite of my grand kids in the kitchen  we picked this microwave primarily for its dimensions  we needed one with a short height   we are very pleased with this model since it is easy to use  works well and is very quiet  it s not loaded with features but has been a pleasure use over the last few months that we ve owned it  this worked fine until it did   which is less than 24 months  within the duration  the spring lock for the door broke   and now i get the se error  which means the unit is toast and i now need to look for a new one  am not going to buy another samsung appliance  the microwave has work very nice  a bit pricy thou but in the long run it will have been a good inventment as my wife loves to coooook  i had to  order 3 of these because the first two arrived damaged  after the third one was installed it looks great and works great  i got it just before thanksgiving so i used it as an oven so i then had two ovens which came in very handy  after reading either terrible or   34 hit and miss  34  reviews of other small footprint microwaves with   34 handle doors  34  rather than   34 push button  34  i came across this from whirlpool  it had great reviews so i tried it for our new granite countertop  didn t want to use up much space     it is perfect   the unit was purchased to replace an old whirlpool unit that had performed flawlessly for 20 years  although none of the holes lined up the sharp unit fit perfectly into the space above our cooktop  so far the unit has performed as advertised  it works   it does seem a bit cheaply made  but you aren t paying top dollar so you should expect that   the door isn t real solid feeling  so far no problems though   we mounted this over stove and the fan had low and high and now only has high   not sure what happened but it still works   be aware that if this microwave gets too hot  sitting over a self clean oven or cooking at high temps  the fan will kick on and won t shut off   fine  but we didn t know that at first and thought it was broken   it s just trying to cool itself off   love the 30 second feature   so many things just need short time to warm up or soften and so just pop it in  press the 30 sec and it goes   easy  fast   use that all the time  i bought this microwave about two years ago  and it still looks and functions great   have not had a single issue     when shutting  yet works well and seems to be a good value for the price  i guess i just miss the more sleek  less noisy one that broke after 9 years     this microwave is very cute  there s no other word to describe it    and as promised is good for small spaces  it does seem to require more cook time than most microwaves i am used to  and sometimes it is a pain to have to keep holding the   sign to increase time  as opposed to just typing in the number  so far i have had no issues  and the unit is not very noisy at all which is nice  this is stuff  it really worked very well  it save me a great deal of money having to replace a microwave that still works very well  i highly recommend this product  i received and installed the microwave  so far  i am pleased with it  br    br   it was damaged in shipping  a dent on the top back edge  this does not affect the installation or operation  i noted that a number of other reviewers had damage in shipping  this needs to be fixed  better packaging and selection of carrier might help  br    br   the hardware  toggle bolts  were cheap and just fell apart when i used them  i had to use other hardware to install the unit  br    br   the template is a bit off  i had to redrill the holes for the top cabinet to get it to fit  i measured the holes on the unit and found the template was off about 3 4 of an inch  as all the other reviews have said  the footprint of this microwave is fantastic  i can t believe other companies have not copied the shape of this microwave  i now have so much more room on my counter  br   the only quirk that takes a little getting used to is not having number keys to punch in the time  the start button adds thirty seconds every time it s hit or you can add the   key to get a more accurate time  i always use my microwave for quick reheating so it s not a big deal to me  worth getting used to for the extra space gained  plus  it microwaves as quickly as its replacement even though the wattage is less  i researched many microwaves for our needs  and this is the perfect unit  it is my second one  as the first i had special ordered to be delivered to a big box store  it arrived damaged  this one arrived fine  well packaged for the trip  it cooks evenly in the convection mode and as a microwave it is fabulous  it arrived when promised  i would definitely buy from this seller again  had one about 20 yrs  that was losing power   new one has added features that are helpful   esp  sensor cooking  br   price is up there esp  for stainless steel  yeayy i love this microwave it takes such a small space in my tiny kitchen but it is huge inside    it has popcorn button as well    i did not buy this microwave on amazon  but felt compelled to add to the feedback as i buy many other products here using the customer reviews   i bought this microwave 2 years and 2 weeks ago   it completely failed last night   it was running as normal  got very loud  then completely died   i ve reset breakers and checked that power is still being supplied   everything checks out   samsung wants  288 for the service contract to fix it  but as of this posting  that s how much a new microwave costs   do yourself a favor and avoid this microwave  purchase was a good one   love the design of the microwave  and so far it meets all my needs   being short  the drawer is much more comfortable for me   the process of ordering and receiving from amazon was simple  efficient and has been one of the best purchases i ve made in the whole kitchen reno project  thanks amazon  we bought this microwave as part of a kitchen remodel 2 years ago  we have loved it from day one  being able to open and stir things or just lift things out is so convenient  the kids love it and always enjoy using it  it has a lot of settings and features which we use regularly  the fact that there s a turn table does not bother me  i have not noticed any uneven heating  we have enjoyed it so much that we just bought another one to put in the kitchen of the new house we just bought  i have never regretted this purchase  and neither will you  did the job  great coverage  made the inside of the microwave look almost brand new  very satisfied   would purchase again so far  so good   i have no complaints  but it s only been in use for about 6 months   if i start noticing the same wear and tear  i e  peeling paint on the interior   i ll post an update   we use this appliance several times a day  everyday  worked fine for 13 months then it stop heating food and it does not show any error messages  searched on online for a solution to the problem and found that running the fan on high works for some people  i gave it a try and yes it does work  the only way to heat our food is by turning the fan on high before setting the time and pushing the start button  our microwave is installed under a cabinet but not above any stove or range  so steam or moisture is not the problem  i called samsung and their only solution was for me to buy their extended warranty for  250 00 for one year  i told them no thanks  if i m going to spend more money on a microwave it won t be on a sumsung  the beep is too loud  and the door rattles  fixed the door rattle by lifting up the back with a folded 3 by 5 card  good microwave oven for the near deaf  and the digital display is too bright in my studio apartment  i wanted a microwave oven  not a nightlight  like 2 of the 9 reviewers here at the time of this writing  the microwave arrived damaged   heavily dented and deformed on the back and side  and this one is uninstallable as a result   3 out of 10 damaged isn t very impressive   obviously i can t comment on the function   if you order  make sure to inspect the unit before wasting time reading all the installation instructions and getting the template in place  etc     microwave works great and it is more powerful than we expected   keep in mind that we do not cook in it    we only use it to heat up drinks and some leftovers   we like how easy it is to set time with just the 30 second button or the   button that adds 5 seconds at a time   the only complain we have is that the door sometimes does not shut   we need to push it up a little to get it to close   other than that  it was a great purchase for us it s a nice looking microwave and it does a great job  when it works   ours failed 2 weeks after the warranty expired  repair cost was more than buying a new one so we ended up getting a new one  this kenmore microwave eats microwave tubes like 1 every year  since tubes are now made in far east  instead of by raytheon  quality as dropped  i now expect to replace tube yearly and budget for it  it was nice to find a tube with diode  which has never failed  for such a great price  this saved us from needing to buy a new microwave  oven combo  easy to use   we used it to fix our microwave about 2 months ago and it s held up  very high quality product  this paint spayed right on with minimal dust and adhered right to the microwave for a smooth finish  display didn t light up so unit wasn t usable when it first arrived  ge service was pleasant and resolved after 2nd visit   a few days later  the light under the microwave stopped working   2 issues in less than a month doesn t bode well    also you can only heat in 15 sec increments when using the time dial   but the good news   options for preconfigured settings for various items and their cooking times  potato  veg  etc      are fairly substantial and works efficiently   however     i wouldn t recommend installing the microwave above your stove  since the microwave is faced in stainless steel  the door handle and face of microwave gets extremely hot to the touch while cooking on the stovetop   speaking of the stove  i had much better luck with ges caf  dual range gas stove   bought at the same time  no issues  works great  highly recommend stove without any hesitation  absolutely love it      wish i felt the same about the microwave  i needed a small  compact microwave  this is perfect if you have limited counter space  the depth is good  it will hold a dinner plate but the interior height is shorter than a regular size microwave  this is because the controls are on the lower panel instead of on the side  the control buttons are simple but intuitive  i ordered and it was very fast shipping about couple days  br   my turntable engine was broken after 10 years used my microwave  br   i m very easy removed old engine and put new one  br   quality product and parts was new  br   highly recommended this seller  love this little microwave  it is the perfect size  holds just a dinner plate  and love that it does not take up a tremendous amount of room  we don t use it for much other than occasionally heating something up  1 2x month  or steaming vegetables  so i can t speak to how it does for heavy use  i bought this because the counter footprint and wattage were both low  i didn t expect very intuitive controls  a super easy to clean interior  weirdly efficient heating  stuff gets hot fast  and thoughtful design touches like an interior light that switches off with disuse  and a polite  non obnoxious   34 your stuff is done  34  beep that only goes off a few times before quieting down  it s a great little microwave  bit tall  but that should be obvious from the pictures   update  died in 2017 after years of faithful service  and i m going to replace it with the same model  it has a totally unmatched capacity to footprint ratio  and i m really annoyed that no one else is making microwaves that stack the mechanical bits under or over the food cavity  this is obviously the better way to build a microwave  description br     62  can be mounted in a 24  34  wide x 12  34  deep space   not intended to be installed above a range  standard ranges are 30  34  wide   does not include a built in hood for use above a range  br     62  has the great simple operation of previous spacemakers  for example to heat a cup of coffee 1 minute  place it in the microwave and press   34 1  34    that s all  br     62  well built  albeit with more plastic and less metal than my old spacemaker ii  br     62  quieter than my old spacemaker ii  although that s no big deal  br     62  the turntable is a nice addition  my old spacemaker ii did not have a turntable   but reduces the total space available  unless you turn the turntable off   br     62  has all of the controls and options of my old spacemaker ii  br      plus popcorn    34 beverage  34     34 reheat  34     34 chicken fish  34     34 potato  34   and   34 vegetable  34  buttons  which i probably won t use because i like to know what the microwave is doing   br      other new buttons are   34 delay start  34

seconds is ideal for warming a cup of coffee  or heating some pastries  br      there is a child lockout  but without a dedicated button  br    br   undercounter installation br     62  the microwave itself comes with a paper template for drilling the necessary holes  but the template can be confusing and may not apply in all cases  br     62  the microwave hangs from four  1 1 4  34  long machine screws  which are inserted from above  from inside the cabinet above   if the floor of the cabinet is greater than 1 2  34  thick  then the length of the screws needs to be equal to the thickness of the floor plus 1 2  34   br     62  hypothetically  you could install the microwave with the four screws from your local hardware store  and 4 big washers  e g   2  34  in diameter    however the installation kit is probably easier  br     62  if you use the template  double check the logic  and adjust the location of the screw holes accordingly  br       the key measurement is the distance from the front holes to the front of the cabinet  you usually want the front of the microwave to be flush with the front of the closed doors of the cabinet    that is  the front holes should be approximately 3 1 4  34  back from the front of the closed doors   br       the door of the microwave needs an extra 1 8  34  on the left in order to open fully  and the grill for the ventilation fan is on the left side of the microwave   if there is an obstruction on the left side  such as wall  cabinet  or refrigerator   you may wish to shift the holes 1 4  34  to the right  if you can  br    br   undercounter installation kit br     62  if this is an new undercounter installation  or the space between the front and back screw holes  inside the cabinet above the microwave  is not  6 1 4  34   then you need ge part  wx4 a019   asin b001h815to ge part number wx4 a019 under cab mt     if you are replacing a spacemaker with a distance of  6 1 4  34  between the front and back holes  then you probably do not need an installation kit  br    br   if you are replacing an old spacemaker ii  for which the spacing between the front and rear screw holes is  7 3 4  34      br     62  i purchased this profile spacemaker to replace a 23 year old spacemaker ii   but neither the holes  backing plate  nor the screws were the same  br     62  the spacing from the cabinet front to the forward screw holes is almost the same for my old spacemaker ii and this new profile spacemaker  br     62  the lateral spacing  side to side  between the screw holes is the same 19 15 32  34  for my old spacemaker ii and this new profile spacemaker  br     62  but the spacing between the front and rear holes is not the same  the new spacing is 6 1 4  34    br     62 so  if the holes in your cabinet are for the old spacemaker ii  then you need only drill new rear holes in your cabinet for this profile spacemaker   draw a line on the cabinet between the centers of the existing front and back holes  measure 6 1 4  34  back from the center of the front hole  and drill the new hole there  br     62  the screws seem to be very similar  but a slightly different diameter or pitch  perhaps they are metric   hypothetically  you could drill new holes in the old backing plate  or use washers instead of the backing plate   and find screws the right size and length  but i decided to purchase the new kit instead  br    br   before you replace a dead microwave oven     br     62  my old spacemaker ii died three times over 23 years as the result of power surges  lightning    i accidentally learned that the trick is to unplug the microwave overnight for the electronics to reset   i ve had the same experience with several other appliances  br     62  even refrigerators and clothes driers have built in computers these days   if any electric appliance is not working properly  unplug it  and leave it unplugged a while   for some reason  perhaps large capacitors in the circuit  big appliances usually need hours to reset  br    br   reliability br   if my experience with my old spacemaker ii is any indication  this profile spacemaker should be very reliable   although resurrected 3 times over 23 years  my old spacemaker was still working when i   34 took it out of service  34    after 23 years of daily use  some of the white finish was turning yellow  there were patches of rust inside  and the door switch  which turns the light on and off  was erratic  br    br   if your old spacemaker had a tray instead of a turntable  keep the tray from your old microwave  br     62  the tray will fit

to ask a question  fits beautifully in a corner of my kitchen so much better than a full sized rectangular one ever did   because the controls are on the bottom  instead of the side  the door is higher and it easily clears the edge of the sink next to it and  occasionally  drying dishes without having to move anything  br    br   love the sleekness of the look and simplicity of the controls   miss the number pad a bit  but knew it didn t have one when i bought it and am quickly adjusting   power control and basic instructions on what setting to use have been helpful  couldn t even figure out power setting on previously owned machine     oh and the very short beeps at the end of a cycle are not nearly as annoying as the longer ones on other models i have owned  br    br   we typically use for reheating food  single or multiple servings  or beverages and the occasional bowl of popcorn and it heats quite well   in fact  the popcorn button is the only part i completely dislike  as it is preset for only 1 75 oz bags and cannot be changed   we gave up preservative laden pre packaged bags of popcorn years ago in favor of real kernels using a special bowl or paper bag  so the popcorn setting is useless for us   have not noticed any difference in heating between this and previous full size model we owned  except that beverages seem to heat faster   full sized plates fit and have had no issue with container heights  even my large popcorn bowl fits nicely   br    br   bought the white version online at home depot  as their price was actually better than amazon s and included free delivery as well   definitely recommend to anyone looking for a smaller microwave  i purchased a pem31smss ge microwave because fit in the space i have  and also look good  but let me tell you if you thinking buying some thing like this pice of junk  only going to last you the most 2 years  or less that is what it lass me  when you call ge they ready to sell you a new one problably with the same problems  fits perfect and works great never thought i would find one that would fit my kitchen in stainless steel look bought this to replace a builder grade off brand unit that came with the house  in performance and style  this whirlpool microwave is absolutely superior  a few notes  br    br     heats faster and more evenly than i m used to  depth is 17 inches  which is one inch larger than my old microwave  thus  i m able to use my large square plates in this one  br    br     install was a bit tricky  i installed in a slot previously occupied by a microwave  so i did not have to cut a vent hole or locate studs  i did have to remove the old mounting plate  which was shorter  this unit came with a cardboard template to locate the bottom line of the mounting plate on the wall  this wall template worked fine   i simply drew the line  then held up the metal plate  and drilled into the studs in the appropriate holes  br    br   the top template was a different matter  whirlpool provides a paper template to affix to the underside of your cabinets to locate the holes to drill for the cabinet mount  if you have a recess under your cabinets  as i do  you will need to trim the template to get it to fit  i did this  and drilled through the template holes  they were about a half inch off  i threw the template away and remeasured  and drilled 9 1 2 from the back wall  not 10 as specified in the installation instructions   these holes worked  br    br   the power cord also has to go through the cabinet above  the instructions say to bore a 1 5 inch hole  i did this with a spade bit  enlarging a   75 inch hole from the old microwave   seems a bit large  could probably have gotten away with a 1 inch hole  br    br   i have the microwave wall vented  installing the flap with sheet metal screws on the microwave and placing into my pre existing vent hole was easy  i can t speak to the ease of the ceiling vent mount  br    br     there are presets for popcorn  potator  and pizza  of these  i ve only used the pizza setting to reheat a small slice  took 1 minute 40 seconds on a lower setting but heated it a bit too hot  would probably be fine for a large slice  br    br   other than that  it looks and works great  we do not have this exact model  we have a smh 9187st  ours is three years old and just recently got the dreaded 5e se error  i found online that if you called them they would cover it under an epidemic warranty for the specific problem of the 5e keypad error    called they sent a local repair man out in less than 7 days all fixed at no charge   i feel like samsung is well aware of this issue and with and will stand behind their products   i would buy another one after this experience  this is a good microwave that fits well in the corner of the kitchen  it fits a full size dinner plate  i just finished remodeling my kitchen a few months ago  i was trying to go for something different in putting together my design and i thought this would not only be cool  it would free up some valuable counter space  i was a little concerned upon reading some of the reviews from some who have purchased this microwave and aren t too thrilled with it s performance however upon much consideration  i decided to take the chance and as nike says  just do it  i have been using my microwave religiously since june and it has been nothing but the best  it looks sleek and cool built into my cherry cabinet  the performance of the unit has been trouble free to date and overall  i would not hesitate to buy it again  the poor reviews of this product must have involved a bad batch  this microwave has worked great for us  very powerful great look and fits in a very tight space  i really like the one touch timer feature  it seems to be well built  ours has a sticker inside that says built april 2013  i am glad we got a more recent built unit than what seems to be problems with earlier units  in our family we mostly use the microwave oven to reheat food  99  of the time  defrost takes the rest   it does the job well but it lacks one convenient element for that purpose  the start button has no memory  this means that you have to retype the amount of time you want to reheat every time  our previous one  also a whirlpool  from 20 years ago  remembered the time we put in previously and that was extremely convenient  br   a more minor issue  the fan and light have two modes  hi lo  but no separate button for each mode  saves space  so you have to push three times when you use these functions  this microwave works well and is efficient  it does make more noise than my last one but it makes up for it in performance  would not hesitate to purchase again  i got this because it was touted as a mini microwave  of course  i am capable of reading the dimensions  which i did  but when it arrived it still seemed shockingly huge for a mini or compact microwave  it simply won t work with my limited counter space  i don t know how well it works  because after trying it in various spots  i put it right back in the box  btw  it is  30 to send back  so make sure you want it before you order  this little giant is great for small spaces  it is very easy to use and works just as well as larger microwaves  i am very happy with purchase  my so called top of the line ge profile microwave burned out and had a bad tube after only 3 years so i needed a microwave that would match all my appliances and didn t want to make the mistake of spending a fortune on a microwave again since nothing seems to last anymore   i really liked the samsung looks and the price compared to the other big brands was enticing but i read tons of negative reviews and held off on buying it   a few weeks later i see it on sale from its already great price and bought it  230   it sticks out about an inch more beyond my cabinets than the ge did but i think this is intentional as the exhaust vent blows out of the top toward the front of the unit   this actually provides better coverage when cooking on the stove top as well since everything rises right up into the vent hood   it s been a year and a half and it still works great   it s just as powerful as the ge was so either it s under rated or the ge was over rated in wattage   for under 300 bucks you can t go wrong with this microwave   the stainless doesn t mark up with smudges as easy as my other appliances and it has just as many features as the more expensive ones   it s controls are lot easier to use than the touch screen was on my ge   fyi don t get a touch screen appliance    i like the 4 fan speeds   my only complaint is when the kitchen timer goes off it just beeps once and it s easy to miss it   other than that i m really surprised at how great this microwave has turned out and though i haven t had to deal with customer service personally i ve heard they re very easy to deal with which is more than i can say for ge   goodbye ge and good job samsung  this was bought as part of a package of kitchen equipment in may 2013  br    br   currently it hasn t worked for 1 4 of the time i have owned it  br    br   as other reviewers have identified there is a known issue where they stop working and don t response at all   samsung executive customer service refuses to do anything outside the attempt to  repair it 3 times process   br    br   there is nothing good to say about samsung  their product  their staff or their agencies   to continue to sell a product that is known to be deficient is negligent br    br   i own other samsung products but because of this i will never buy one again and make sure i can influence others to do likewise  br    br   please don t buy this product   it will most likely fail and you will wish you hadn t    br    br   i certainly regret it this is a very handsome appliance and for the first year it operated well or as expected  within weeks of the first year anniversary the microwave died  an operating board went out and it no longer functioned and the repair would cost almost as much as replacing the product  i contacted ge and they instructed me to have a repairman to come in and diagnose the problem  if i decided to repair or replace they would give me credit for the service call  but because the warranty had just run out they would not be responsible for replacing the product  we installed this above an electrolux dual fuel oven  for which it provides venting and downward facing led lights in addition to its primary microwave functions  it was fairly inexpensive and looks good in the kitchen   observations in no particular order  br    br   1  the sensor cooking on this is much better than on our old sharp countertop unit  which overcooked everything   i had thought at the time that it would be nice if there was a way to calibrate the sensor   while the samsung doesn t give you calibration options  it does let you say what you are cooking  and apparently adjusts its response to the sensor accordingly   i have found that it works pretty well to always tell it i m reheating pasta  br    br   2  a general use kitchen timer is provided   of course most microwaves do  so that s not unusual  but this one is smarter than some   it is able to function independently of the cooking timer   for example  if you are timing something for 30 minutes  then decide partway through you want to heat a cup of water for one minute  it will correctly keep track of the 30 minute timer in the background and display it again after it s done with the water  br    br   3  minor niggle  the oven vent is supposed to come on whenever it detects heat rising from below  but ours seems to always need to be turned on manually  br    br   4  this is where the samsung loses a review star   the eco mode feature is poorly conceived   when you press the button  the panel lights go out and standby power consumption is reduced   so far  so good   but then as as soon as you use the microwave again  or even just open the door  or use the oven light or vent options  it leaves eco mode  the display comes back on and stays on   it really should remember eco as a user preference rather than as a temporary mode   i also suspect this ties in to the problems some customers have had with the control panel failing   if we were allowed to set a persistent eco mode  it s likely that the front panel would be mostly off except when in actual operation  and as a result it might not burn out   we have made it a habit to push the eco button after each use  br    br   in sum  it fits with our kitchen decor and cooks well  and we hope we will be able to make it last a long time by remembering the eco button as often as possible  this kit is just what i needed   my microwave stopped warming food and made a loud buzzing sound when on   i didn t want to replace the whole unit because it matched my stove   i got this kit and it was really pretty easy to install   now it works like new again  br    br      there are dangers of electric shock  so do your research     br    br    keep track of all your screws and bolts and where they go   i received on time  but with damage on the door and left side and with out grill i m not so happy the four fixed screws on the unit does not line up with the existing hole of the microwave  so i had to zip tie it down  br   they needed to be at the 12 and 6 o clock position for me to bolt it down  but it works great  samsung might make tons of nice product but oven range microwave is not one of them  seems like 5e or se code seems to be the common problem with their microwave  br   my warranty was just about to run out and i ve been getting this code  i should have doing research before i went with them  live and learn i suppose  18 month old microwave will not stop running until unplugged  which is a complete fire hazard and deemed unsafe   i will never purchase a frigidaire product in my lifetime again  or recommend it to anyone   this is not the first 18 month old frigidaire product i will have to replace   stop now if you are considering this product brand    box was not crushed but top venting cover was dented and cracked   i used the old one from the same model that needed to be replaced as to avoid all of the return bs  while i love the shape of the microwave  it does fit perfectly in a corner   the turntable is defective and does not turn   upon removing the packaging  i immediately turned the microwave on and placed a cup of water in it to see if it was heating ok  walked off a minute and when i returned the water was very hot   i thought eveyrthing was ok  so i threw the packaging away   a few days later  i put a plate of food in the microwave to heat it up and that s when i noticed the turntable was not turning   i opened the door  checked the wheels it revolves on  replaced the glass  gave the glass a little turn and still nothing   i tried even placing things of different weights on it  sometimes it would turn a little like it was trying to turn but then would abruptly stop   so buyers beware  i would not purchase this item  it worked for three weeks and now it won t start  luckily we kept the box and are sending it back  what a pain  it is a basic microwave and so far working very well  br   it fit perfect over our oven range  br   my husband and his friend s help needed for taking old one out and setting this microwave up  br   door feels very light  we are used to the metal one  so we get gentle on it  but it is a little deep for where i have it  beautiful and stylish  easy to use  with sensitive touch screen  bought this product a while ago  handle breaks off over time  ge knows of the problem  charges  60 for the handle and delivers it without screws  one of those broke as well  on line parts support says the handle does not come with screws and there is nothing they can do  live and learn  when ordering cabinet for microwave i had no clue that sharp offered a drawer oven that would fit into the cabinet perfectly   it looks so great and works beautifully  we got it the same day our cabinets were being installed  we were worried about it not working since this was our first on line purchase of such a high priced item  let me tell you how easy it went in and it performed fantastic     it is exactly what we wanted and the slide out drawer has our friends looking into how they can install one in their kitchens  we installed it in a bottom cabinet directly under the countertop  great height and so convenient to place hot items right onto the countertop  no more reaching over head or over a hot stove to get anything out  this is a real gem and an awesome addition to our kitchen  bought this for a small kitchen  it fits nicely in the corner and works great  seems to be well made  although it is lower wattage  i have not had to significantly increase the cooking time  and i can fit a plate or even cook reheat in a round 2qt dish  the beep is a little loud but otherwise no complaints  so far it has worked fine with no service calls   i will keep you posted in future years   given how nicely it fits in our kitchen island  i would probably buy another one even if it lasted only 2 years   update   finished year 4 with no problems   still very happy  this product fits into a small corner counter space that i have  and it   34 looks  34  nice   but truth be told  i could have saved money and bought a small rectangular mw and put it on the same counter  although it wouldn t have looked quite as nice as this one does  at first glance this appliance looks good but the trim is poorly attached and is coming off after three months of use   it does not have enough power to properly pop popcorn   it takes 2 3 minutes to boil a cup of water   if you  build a cabinet to fit it for a built in look  you will have a hard time finding a replacement that will fit into the space   i would definitely not recommend this microwave the ceiling of my microwave was a disaster  paint was peeling all over it  this product did the trick  make sure you sand properly and spray several light coats rather than one thick one  this is a good looking microwave and the value is unbeatable  my only disappointment is that it sticks out from the cabinet way more than the flush unit it replaced  my regular glasses can t fit in so keep that in mind  you ll need shorter glasses  its footprint is a winner  even though i got tons of real estate on my countertop already  i still appreciate how much space it frees up when compared to my big ass conventional mw  i do miss the analog dial  to set minutes  on my old mw though  touching these touch sensitive totally flat buttons is just so unnatural   i regret that i didn t buy this earlier  bought this cutie for the outdoor kitchen in my rv   i had limited space to work with so this was the perfect choice for me   the unit sits in one corner of the outdooor kitchen counter leaving me enough room to add a hot plate as well  br    br   great item at a great price   enough power to handle all routoine microwave tasks  i have just gone through 10 weeks of kitchen remodel that was supposed to take 5 6 weeks  i researched venting microwaves and found very good reports on this one  the availability and price here on amazon beat my local big box stores and chains  installation appeared easy for my contractors  there are options to allow venting outside  either behind or above the microwave  not so clear from product description  but we had planned to vent through filters as the only other option was through our garage  not compatible with local code   br    br   the bells and whistles are amazing  with our kids ready to show us how it works  right after we stop the clock blinking on our vcr  had large amount of rust under rotating plate in ge microwave   surface prep is important   i started out with sandpaper and discovered this was going to take too long due to the amount of rust i had   i ended up using a 1  34  metal paint scraper to remove all paint rust down to base metal in the damaged area  this worked very well   then sanded smooth   wiped surface clean with rubbing alcohol  masked off area to be painted   ensure adequate ventilation when painting   i applied mutliple coats   2 months of usage thus far    looks great  holding up great  i bought a used micro that works great but needed a little   34 tweaking  34  for paint touch p inside  br   this did the job  it is so nice  it works  is small  has a wonderful shape  it is an acquisition for my kitchen  i recommend it  you d expect more than five years out of a product in this price range  however  the control panel died after five years   well not quite died   you can still make things happen  it s just not always what you expect   you hit the 3 and you get 4   you hit the start button and it goes to help   on top of that  the fan filters are really flimsy  the tab you use to take them out to clean broke after the fifth time out   we are going to buy a counter microwave  definitely not ge  and a real vent hood  september 13  2013 over one month after delivery and still not usable     getting upset  br    br    the rating reflects the fact that it is not working yet     br   so i can t be sure that it will  br   the unit was delivered and it is what i wanted because it is exactly like the one i had for 14 years  newer model of course   but it has not been working as it should  i wonder if the tech will really getting it to work correctly  waiting now for parts to fix the oven portion of the unit  the tech tells that the microwave portion only cooks on the sides and the center does not get the ray to cook the food  how can that be possible   anyway here i am one full month after purchasing the oven and can t use it  i still will be happy if they get it to work properly  br   love the fact that the color is not bisque     thankfully it is almond like the previous one although the bottom of this one is white      why    was it refurbished     original bottom damaged      will never know  after following the instructions it fixed my rusty microwave oven  i m happy i had found this product  now i don t have to pay a costly repair bill  i needed a microwave that would handle large dinner plates but took no space   this item fits the bill perfectly   it fits neatly into a corner of my countertop  in no way dominates the area  and functions way beyond what i expected   if you are looking for a compact microwave that handles big things this is it   don t hesitate to purchase it   highly recommended  after ups destroyed a whirlpool unit last week  i opted to upgrade to this ge model   the mistake i made was allowing ups to handle the shipment again   it is becoming apparent that ups cannot handle anything that requires a hand truck without damaging it   i would suggest that amazon include a carrier option for shipping heavy items to possibly preclude damage in shipment   for me  ups would fall just below the kid down the street with his little red wagon   as to the ge microwave  it arrived with two corners completely bashed in and assorted other small dents   not exactly a 30 000 foot drop  but enough to render it unusable   if i m ever able to once again enjoy receiving  installing and using an over the range microwave oven  i ll be sure to review its salient points   oh  and all potential buyers should be aware that if you purchase any item like this from a vender who does not have the caveat fulfilled by amazon next to their name and you have to return the item  you will simply have to wait for the item to arrive back at the vender and then rely on the vender to reimburse the cost   amazon cannot reimburse for it   you must wait for the vender   me   i m still waiting for my  500  caveat emptor  br   september 13   update   item arrived back at the vender today   i m still waiting for my  500  the microwave is light on features but works very well for the functions it provides   it s a very simple micowave that does it s core job well which is exactly what i wanted   i didn t need all of the advanced features  cooking presets and auto options that the more expensive microwaves come with   i installed the microwave in a couple hours removing the old one that didn t work anymore and had a bag of popcorn right after    i had where and tear on the bottom of my unit and paint pealing on the top  i brushes it down with a wire brush and put several coats of paint on it as directed  the product worked great  the inside of my microwave looks brand new  replaced older profile unit with this one  some changes necessary for mounting  fortunately  the exhaust duct was in the same position as the older unit and installation took about 1 hour  love the larger cavity size and rotating table  helps to warm foods more evenly when using microwave  works wonderfully as microwave and as convection oven  saves us energy by allowing us to bake many foods without having to use our stove s larger gas oven and it works quickly  only two   34 observations  34  we have are  1  touch pad is very difficult to see in normal light  attractive design  but near impossible to read as the gray typeface on black background is horrible choice  not a big change for ge to make  surprised that engineering has not yet ordered such an important and easy revision  this may well be a safety and or frustrating issue for some persons  see the labels i ended up making for the touch pad   see photo  2  the volume of the beeper  at loudest  is barely audible   other than the above two   34 cons  34  we are very happy with the purchase  good value   update may 2016   first time we used the convection heater at 400 degrees  after about 5 minutes  the oven died   was as if a fuse had blown   ge service arrived the following day to diagnose the problem  a blown thermostat  estimate about 300 00 for parts and labor   considering this oven is only ablut 2 5 years old  that s far from what our years of ge products repair experience would dictate  shame on ge  we used this brand new microwave for 3 weeks  and last night it caught fire while we were microwaving food  br    br   the food was not burnt  or overcooked  in fact it still had a minute more to go  when i noticed flames inside  at the top fan assembly region  we were able to put it out with a damp towel  but the entire top section was melted to reveal the electrical wiring inside  br    br   we googled to see if anyone had a similar problem and found the review posted just a week earlier hear on amazon  this is clearly not some random freak accident  but a recurring problem with this microwave  br    br   if you have this microwave  do not leave it unattended while microwaving  if you are considering purchasing it  please please do not do it  purchased 4 11 and have not had any issues  love the turn off beep function  filters are not at local home depot  as advertised   easy to replace  not really much more to say  bought a replacement part and it worked  saved the money for a new microwave  we ve had a smh9187  which search led me here  for 3 years and it s been great  br    br   starting today whenever we close the door the microwave turns itself on   i see other reports here and elsewhere of samsung microwaves turning themselves on   seems like there should be a recall  br    br   update  they sent a tech out to replace the keypad and door latch mechanism   didn t solve it  but a few days later he came back out and replaced the door   so far so good  i must prequalify this review with the statement of fact that we have 4 major samsung appliances or electronic devices in our home  i have always liked samsung  br    br   bought and installed this microwave in january of 2012  it just died two days ago  totally dead    no functionality whatsoever  no lights  no keypad  nothing but dull  silent  insolent non function  it isn t my circuit  as my oven  also samsung  shares the outlet and is working fine  br    br   i called samsung  and since it is just out of warranty  the service call would be  125 just to look at it   parts and labor  on top of that  the first call would be the diagnosis  and the technician would not have the parts  they would have to reschedule for that  br    br   since i have a toddler in the house  not having a microwave is out of the question  so the risk of a  200  250 repair bill   2 weeks of being out of commission basically means i have to go buy a new       microwave  br    br   argh  so irritating  do not buy  this microwave came with my apartment  mine is model jvm1540dm4ww  but it looks identical to this one   and it totally blew away my expectations of what a good microwave should be  it cooks quickly and evenly  everything takes about half as long as it did in my old microwave   the button options are good  i use the express cook buttons all the time   the bright and dim surface light options are nice  the shelf inside is pretty cool  even though i never cook that much at once   and i think it looks great in the kitchen  the rest of the kitchen is wonderful white and metal ikeaness   it s gotten a lot of use over the past year  and it s still performing just like new  i was surprised to see the negative reviews here  as i would absolutely buy another one of these  we used the dacor labelled version of this aplliance for 10 years before it gave out  found out this is the exact same appliance as the dacor  at half the price  so we ordered this one  but returned it immediately because it  had dents  so obviously had been dropped  and seemed to be making a louder noise than the old dacor when operating and i was afraid it had internal damage  amazon was as always good on making full refund on its return  i then came across a highly discounted floor model microwave that featured a 400 cfu exhaust system  vs the 300 cfu exhaust on this product   a feature very important to my wife who does a lot of stir frying  the microwave i bought is also 1100 watts vs 850 watts on this one  but i don t know how important an extra 250 watts really is  850 watts was just fine for us for  10 years   could it be the lower wattage helped it last so long  and the convection oven utility is something we may miss more than we now think we will  br   anyway i think this is a pretty good product  particularly if you use the convection function a lot  one word of advice if you buy this and vent it to the outside  remove the vent flap on top of the unit and install a vent flap at the end of the duct line  our vent flap became loaded with grease and stuck in the closed postion  the exhaust  then entered and covered the wiring and internal parts with grease  causing it to overheat and blow the magnitron  also be religious about keeping the vent screens clean  if we had done those things our old dacor may have lasted who knows how much longer  we considered repairing it but the technician said there was too much grease  great small size  looks good  fits in a corner and does not take up a lot of apace  and works very well  have owned sharps in past   this fit perfectly above stove  no alterations  no fuss   works great  looks great  would recomend i love it   i have a small kitchen with limited counter space and this little microwave is exactly what i needed   it works as well as any other microwave i have owned   very happy  after having read reviews for more expensive upmarket brand microwaves like lg and panasonic  we went to our local  canadian  wal mart to see what they had  br    br   the first thing i noticed about this one is that it is completely stainless steel  front and back  outside and inside  all around  it looks like a professional food service microwave  to me  the stainless steel interior is easier to clean than a white painted one  br    br   we have heard that microwave ovens don t last like they used to  we have one low quality unbranded otr one in a mobile home at the moment which was new in 1995   still working as well as it ever did  and another lg 900 watt in an rv from 2004  also a good runner at this writing  july 2013   br    br   we didn t want to spend a lot of money if the microwave was only going to last a couple of years  well  with this danby  we have a two year replacement warranty  if it dies before its time  we either get a new one or a refund of the money we spent on this one  fair enough  i thought  br    br   there are not a lot of features here and it isn t super powerful  certainly adequate but our lg 900 watt heats things up a bit faster and has more useful programs like casserole re heat with 4 levels and programs for either fresh or frozen vegetables with different quantities  br    br   the danby reheat button has only 3 minutes  no other options  for most cooking reheating you have to punch in the time you guess is about right manually  br    br   considering the price   100 canadian plus sales tax  and the two year replacement warranty   10 from wal mart   we are pretty well pleased with this so far  we have never had a countertop microwave as big as this one so we had to get used to all the acreage it takes up  we might have considered an otr but this condo kitchen has no range hood at the moment  i receive so many compliments about this cutie in our second kitchen  we have little counterspace in the area and this is worth every penny  works great  and a spectacular space saver  highly recommended  similar to many other reviewers  we were happy with our purchase until the se error appeared  the microwave lasted for 3 years without a problem  but suddenly tonight while using the stove  the microwave gave the error message  we tried to troubleshoot the problem  but nothing worked  br    br   i called samsung to report the problem  and they are sending out someone to repair the control panel free of charge  because of the negative reviews  they do have a special warranty on this part of the unit since it is such a common problem  despite their helpful customer service  i would not purchase this samsung microwave unless you eventually want to have to replace a faulty control panel  don t buy      our old version of the ge profile caught fire while heating up something   fortunately our 8 yr  old son was in the room and was able to get my husband s attention before it escalated   however  while trying to replace our microwave  we found that the only item we could replace it with was a ge microwave  either the profile  which is the downgraded version of our former product  or a ge monogram  the exact same unit as our old profile with a different name and much higher pricetag    ge s response was to replace the item with the lower level model profile  which we originally tried to replace it with but was falling apart after a couple of uses    in order to get the exact same microwave  now called the monogram  we had to pay an additional  335 for the upgrade   getting the microwave delivered in a timely and convenient fashion was another debacle   sadly  we are stuck using this ge product because our cabinets were built around the original  and nothing else will fit  we purchased this microwave  and then realized that 2 cu ft  is way too big for a family of three  we hoped to exchange it for a smaller one  br    br   sharp told us that we were responsible for shipping  fair enough   but also that we would have to pay a 30  restocking fee  br    br   this is absurd  who s ever heard of a 30  restocking fee  we never even removed this from the cardboard box  we simply opened the top  and then re closed it  30  seems like usury to me  frankly  i can t believe amazon would allow a merchant to charge a 30  restocking fee  i m positive their cost of goods sold isn t much more than 30     what are they doing  just trashing returns  br    br   anyway  even if i were going to buy a sharp microwave again  i certainly wouldn t buy it here  and reward these unfair business practices  br    br   we own a business  and we expect to be treated as consumers  the same way we treat our customers   that simply isn t happening here  fits very nicely in a corner spot and doesn t take up much room which is nice when you do not have much counterspace my samsung microwave worked fine until recently  it beeps   it even starts beeping in the middle of the night   i ve unplugged and reset clock several times   now i have to unplug it after every use  and reset to use again   samsung online representative says if resetting doesn t work he would send a serviceman   that would probably cost more than a new microwave   i ll be searching for an new one       definitely not a samsung  this was exactly the one i needed i wasn t sure i would be able to find the one i needed but i did and loved the fact i received it sooner than expected fits in the corner under upper cabinets perfectly  only 750 watts  but just fine for reheating left overs  etc   i like that the   34 controls  34  are under the door  so that the turntable sits a little higher   also  something sitting in front of the microwave does not have to be moved before opening the microwave  as the door opens a few inches above the counter top   i have only had the microwave for a month  but no problems at all   i am very happy with my purchase  this microwave has many good features and fit great into our over the counter space in our kitchen  it was easy to install and has been very reliable  ge makes good products  but don t expect it to last forever  we replaced our old ge microwave that had lasted only about 7 years with this one  the primary reason i bought another ge spacemaker was due to the size configuration that matched our old microwave  i did not want to have to replace my cabinets to have a different sized microwave  while redoing our kitchen  i discovered this microwave and i love it   i was concerned about lack of a turntable but after a month of use  i have founds foods to be heated evenly   the popcorn button works great and i love how easy it is to program things like defrost  melt butter  warm syrup  beverages  etc     most of all  i am thrilled to have the microwave off the counter and the drawer style is a must when mounting in a base cabinet  we bought ge cafe appliances for our remodel and have had nothing but problems   out of 4 separate kitchen appliances  3 have had problems within 2 to 3 years of ownership   the ge cafe microwave suddenly stopped heating and we had to have a repairman come replace the magnetron and diode   it worked a few weeks but stopped working again   then we found out it costs more to repair than to buy a new one   we traced a workaround to the problem ourselves and found that the microwave works as long as we turn on the stove exhaust fan   so now  every time we use our microwave  you need to turn on the exhaust fan   nice   numerous other reviews have complained about the keypad burning out as well  so if you buy  make sure to buy a long term multi year warranty   our ge failures happened shortly after the 1 year warranty expired  and parts labor for most repairs adds up to the purchase of a new appliance  we were reluctant to spend so much on a microwave as we are not big microwave users but we absolutely love this and are glad we splurged  it defrosts without cooking  won t burn popcorn  can soften butter without melting  and of course looks amazing  its easy to clean and was pretty easy to install   if i had to come up with a shortfall there is a height limit so forget tall items like those rice express packages   still worth it and would still recommend it  i got this microwave yesterday and i ve been smiling about it ever since  i just love how it looks in the corner of my kitchen  the only negative to me is that it s kind of expensive for a small microwave  but what was the last thing you bought for your kitchen that just made you happy  since the only con i can think of is the price  i ll just run through the pros as i see them  br   1  it s unique  every other microwave i ve ever seen  with the exception of the sharp half pint  looks pretty much the same  a horizontal rectangle with a door and a keypad control panel to the right  the bottom controls and lack of numeric pad make this thing look entirely different  and in a good way   don t worry about the lack of a keypad  the controls are a no brainer   when you unbox it and see the rounded back  you know you ve bought something different from the norm  br   2  it s big inside  bigger than my old ge compact for round things  and i ve just never had the urge to throw a 9x13 pan in my microwave   i have yet to try it with popcorn  manual says limit it to the 1 75 ounce size   br   3  it s powerful  1 30 on high heats up a cup of water better than my old one  good enough for me  br   4  the led display is blue  very cool  in my opinion  br   5  the interior light goes on when you open the door  some small microwaves only light up while you re cooking  br   6  you can use the timer and cook simultaneously  pretty standard  but some don t  also  you can adjust the timer and the cook time on the fly by hitting   or    no need to stop and reset  and you can toggle between the timer and the clock if you want  br   7  no door release button  you just grab the recessed edge of the door and pull  and it feels solid when you shut it  br   8  the reminder tone shuts off  yes  it reminds you when you forget to pull something out  but it shuts up after three reminders and reverts to the clock   i swear my old microwave displayed end most of the time   br   9  limited features the only special features are defrost  reheat  popcorn  and power level  100   75   50   25   and the power saving 0    i ve never used anything more  br   10  i m running out of ideas  but to make a nice round 10  i ll point out that the door is about two inches thick with a space between an inner and outer window  this gives it a kind of window box look that i like a lot  br   hope this helps convince everybody to pull the trigger and buy this microwave  you won t regret it  br   note  the display panel comes covered in a clear plastic film that is pretty easy to miss when you re unpacking  i didn t see it and was highly alarmed after a couple of days when the start button started to look and feel cracked  further investigation revealed the protective film  which easily peeled off to reveal a pristine panel underneath  i have a general electric microwave model pem31sm4ss manufactured november of 2011 in maylasia and it is peeling on the interior across the rear top  i replaced the previous unit because of the same problem   it also was relatively new at the time   about two years  painting seems to be the option offered for repair  maybe general electric should include a can of paint and brush with their microwave ovens  i will purchase a new one this week but not ge none available  at first we loved this microwave drawer and it seemed to do the core job of heating food just fine   then just over a year after the purchase date  when the builder bought all the appliances  the unit died   no signs of life at all   it had been in use for 3 4 months in total   microwaves have been around for a long time and most are pretty much bulletproof   not this one   reading the reviews it is obvious that sharp has built a flawed product and is not standing behind it   i have called them twice and asked about a product recall  and if they were going to escalate the product defect issues to their development team   no response   it s obvious that their customer service teams do not close the loop and provide feedback to their engineering and business teams   for this price  this is an unbelievable rip off   yes it looks great  but it doesn t work much more than a year   now we re stuck  with the prospect of paying for service  and then waiting until it breaks again   since this is likely a low volume unit  the number of consumer complaints won t be adequate to force sharp to own up to the obvious quality issues  many more features than advertised  reading the manual is highly advised to get the most out of this product  it even has an automatic fan function for over a range use if there s too much heat buid up  great little microwave  it s the perfect size  it s a little underpowered  so a add 30 secs to most cooking times  br   small footprint and looks great in the kitchen  i got this to save counterspace and the fact i only use the microwave for reheating small meals and popcorn   it performs these functions perfectly   it may not have the most power but if another 30 60 seconds of reheating time is going to throw your day off  you have bigger problems than this microwave  i needed a smaller sized microwave to fit on my kitchen counter top  and i couldn t find anything smaller than a 0 7 cu  ft  in any store   since this one had so many good reviews  i decided to give it a try   it not only fits perfectly on my tiny kitchen counter  but it is also the best microwave i ve ever owned   it fits regular sized dinner plates so it s the perfect size  and it heats up very quickly   i would recommend this to anyone especially if you have a small kitchen  purchased this about a month ago and am now on  3 which will be returned too   the panel around the button to open the micro continues to come off   also  it takes at least two pushes to get the door open   with fairly forceful attempts   it s really a shame because it works well otherwise and fits perfectly in our new kitchen  we purchased this microwave in oct 2011 and it stopped heating in june 2013   the defective part is the magnetron   the magnetron has a 5 year warranty but it will cost  90 and 3 days for ge to come to my home to confirm that is the problem   then i am told i can expect to pay another  250  300 for the labor for them to come back out and replace the magnetron  no idea how long that will take   fighting with ge at the moment to have the part shipped to my local repair man who said he would replace for  99 total   warranty information does not say anything about it having to be replace by a ge tech  br    br   we bought all new ge appliances in october 2011 and so far we have had to have the fridge and now the microwave repaired in the first 2 years   i guess we still have the range and dishwasher to look forward to fixing  br   i thought ge was a good company but experience has cleared things up  we bought all new samsung appliance for our new home  the microwave and refrigerator have had to be repaired  the microwave started leaking microwaves and burned the inside lip of the unit and on the inside of the door  burning the paint  samsung replaced the unit after it was seen by an appliance repairman and photos were uploaded to them  my replacement unit just died for no reason  i checked the outlet  breaker and plug   all fine  i have to wait another week before the appliance repairman can come out and tell me i ll have to wait another 2 weeks for a new unit to arrive  then  i ll have to pay for it to be installed again  perfect fit for a tiny counter space  looks great and does small reheats well  interior space is not huge but fits a dinner plate snugly this is perfect for one plate  it nice to have a microwave big enough to cook a turkey  but honesty  who ever cooked a turkey in a microwave  this is perfect and the round design means it fits a plate in a very small space  i got one for my mom  too  and she loves it  she finally threw out her old huge microwave and reclaimed counter space  my only wish would be that it was a full 1000 watts  it s 750  just so it would match the cook times on most microwave meals and recipes  i did not buy this here but from the store with the blue shirt associates  my model is smh9187  which is similar to this one  this was installed by my contractor during a complete kitchen remodel and looked great above the samsung range  after about 2 years  i got what all those 1 star raters got  a sudden incessant beeping that you could not reset or turn off  other than through unplugging the appliance  i tried turning off the main power  etc  but nothing worked  in fact  the error message and beeping became continuous  br    br   friends of mine have had the same model for over three years and they have not had this problem  why  because i cook a lot of steamed food  rice  pasta  vegetables  and they do not  i m sure the heat and steam from the range top has  as others have noted  damaged the circuit board  the keypad is over the right back burner  and even if i use any of the front burners  the steam will cover the entire front of the microwave  this happens even with the fan at full blast  there is always a film of condensation over the bottom half of the microwave  door doesn t always close right and although it is practically new  it sounds like it is dying   would not purchase again  we purchased and installed the drawer oven in august 2010  while doing a remodel in our kitchen   it was a more expensive option  but it fit perfectly in a location between our fridge and sink area  and maintained the contour of the kitchen we were seeking   we use it at least two or three times a day  and have been very pleased with its performance  and we have not had any problems with it   it does not have a turntable  however  our experience is it does the job just as well   it is easy to get to and easy to clean   it does not have a huge interior  so if you have plans to microwave tall items  check the dimensions first so that you are not surprised by that   overall  we have found it to be a very nice addition to our kitchen  and would purchase one again  i loved this microwave s size and shape but in the last month  4 2016  i had two sparking incidents  luckily i was in the kitchen and got it unplugged quickly   i just threw it out  today i was looking online to see when i bought it  april 2013  and if anyone else had reported similar issues    i see that there are similar reviews so don t think ill buy another even tho i like the size and shape    updated 4 2016  it was hard to find a small microwave that didnt look cheap  this looks nice and works great  a keeper it worked great at home  but we got it for our truck  but our 1500 watt inverter can t run it  so it fit great in the freightliner truck  but u gotta have a bigger inverter  i loved the small size of this microwave  but the power was lacking  furthermore  after we had this unit for 1 month  it would not cook anything longer than 2 minutes  the light would remain on and the turntable would continue to spin  but the motor would just shut off and cease cooking  we returned this product  the only thing i would chande is the push handle   sometimes it diesn t work the first time and it feels like it sticks   otherwise  a good product and good value  we bought this microwave cause it matched the ge profile range we had purchased previously   it looks great  br   however  after less than 2 months of use  we had to replace the over the range light bulbs  which is apparently a common issue from the reviews on the ge website   worked fine for a year after that   last week we had an issue where the microwave started beeping to notify us that there was an issue with the keypad   turning the power saver off and on cleared the message  and we continued to use it uninterrupted for another week  until yesterday   after heating lunch  i tried to warm a bottle of milk in this microwave   after 30 seconds it was still cold  so i tried again   at that point the microwave filled with smoke and the kitchen started to smell like something was burning   we were told by the sales guy at the store that it is the magnatron that went  which is covered under warranty  but the labor is not  not to mention the  99 just to have the ge repair guy come to my house   it sounds like something i wouldn t trust to be repaired  br   i definitely do not recommend this product  this is the perfect sized microwave for my kitchen  the domed shape works great on my smaller counter top  would recommend it  my wife wanted a smaller microwave for the counter top   this was perfect     at least for 28 days  br    br   on the 28th day   all the controls appeared to work but the unit no longer heated  br    br   amazon s return policy was to issue a refund   i wanted it fixed so i contacted whirlpool directly   they stated the product had a full replacement guarantee for 12 months and that i would receive a call within 48 hours on how to get the unit fixed or replaced  br    br   it s now one week later   no response from whirlpool and i can no longer get a response from them regarding the commitment they made me a week ago  br    br   i decided to contact amazon about the issue   amazon is sending me a return label and issuing a refund    i should have done this in the first place and never bothered with whirlpool   br    br   i just ordered my second unit from amazon     i m hoping this one will last longer than 28 days  br    br   i would give the unit 5 stars if it had not failed     now only 3   if the second one fails   i ll drop it to 1 or zero stars  br    br   i give amazon 5 stars for service on this item  br    br   joe i have benn using this mivrowave for about a month now and it is great  it is easy  to use and powerful when cooking a microwave meal and the packing tell you to put in in for 3 min  and 30 sconds  your meal will come out nice and hot  this microwave is munch beatter then the lg one i had  any one looking for a good microwave should look in to this one  don t belive the bad reviews  because i have had this microwave for a month now and i have had no problems with it  i got my microwave from home depot  love that it is off the counter  large  and works well   i originally bought this microwave 6 years ago with absolutely no problems   an electric failure in the house caused us to have to replace it  and without question  we bought the same one  i have owned this microwave for 2 years and have never had a problem with it i use it daily for cooking and warming food  i would buy this same unit again  it works great i don t understand all the bad reviews this sharp was a good product i don t understand where people say it has a loud noise while it runs  i have had a few different microwaves and the motor sounds alike on every unit i had my sharp sits on my counter near the stove and it has a really nice appearence to it i am very happy with this sharp microwave  a similar model that we got when we bought our home 6 years ago died and we needed the exact sized model to replace it because the old model was built into a non adjustable shelve frame above the counter top   searched websites and found what i wanted   then searched amazon and found one with the best price    abe s of maine    quick delivery and the packaging crating was extraordinary   would buy product again  and would buy from abe s of maine again  i bought this microwave for my first apartment which has extremely limited counter space   this tucks nicely in the corner that typically isn t usable space and allows me to still have enough room on the counter for food prep   it heats food very evenly and fits a full sized dinner plate in it   even if i eventually move into a place with a larger kitchen  i d likely keep this microwave since it works so well  fits perfectly in our countertop corner   fits in the   34 dead space  34  there  br   it s on the small side  but it is perfect for our needs  exactly what i wanted  it s the perfect fit  works just fine    bye bye bulky hand me down    i m handing you down  lol it met all my needs regarding space  looks like a tv  works well and you don t need a college degree to operate  very pleased with this products  little pricey but worth it  i like this microwave  it is small and uses very little space in my small kitchen  but it is powerful  it is a good combination of quality and good design  expensive but worth it i recently had a house built and the builder only uses ge appliances so i upgraded to the cafe line   i have no complaints with the function of the microwave but the cheap plastic handle bothers me  mine is now bubbling and peeling  i have a work order in with ge to have this replaced   i saw the earlier model  which this microwave replaced had complaints of the handle getting too hot   i guess this is why they went to plastic   i would rather use a towel to open my microwave than have stainless paint flaking into my pots below  this is an okay microwave if you have an extremely small kitchen  br   cons  br   the outside of the microwave is nice and sleek  however  i know the door push button opener won t last because it already has to be pushed several times to get the microwave s door to open  the next issue i have is the cardboard piece that is screwed on the inside of the unit   i really think this is a hazard  not a good idea  and not hygienic if food splatters on it  next cons were how cheap the turntable holder is and how much extra time it takes to microwave foods   frozen stauffers tv dinner took 9 minutes to cook   likewise  if you like to cook microwave popcorn i suggest you use the mini bags with this one   larger bags had too many kernels left or burned if i tried to get most of the kernels cooked  br    br   pros  br   very quiet when operating  br   perfect size for my 6x8 sq ft galley  style kitchen  br   very sleek and the stainless steel accents are beautiful  br   has an interior light  br   loud alarm to warn you when cooking is complete  br   it s quite heavy even though it is a compact size  so it won t fly across the counter if you press a button too hard  br   lots of preset functions and an easy to understand owner s manual  br    br   i thought ge was a great appliance maker   remembering my mother s ge appliances lasting 20  years  this one i pray it last for the rest of this year  also  this microwave is a lot cheaper on wal mart website  60 with free in store shipping  just a heads up if you still want to purchase one of these microwaves  looks great  works great  took less than an hour to install  was a little overwhelmed with instructions  but was easier to install than originally thought  looks great in my kitchen and has opened up so much space in my small kitchen  i would recommend this product to anyone  was great until i opened the door and the microwave inlet cover is  what     cardboard       which i touched and it bent and now am reluctant to use to microwave   waiting for whirlpool to answer my questions about this cardboard affecting my food   they said not to remove it   wondering if anyone has any comments about this  i don t really use lots of fancy microwave features    we just set the power and the time and call it good   this microwave works just great for that  it might also have great features    i just don t know them   br    br   pros  good price  easy to install  nice lights for stovetop  can be configured to vent or recirculate  looks good  br    br   cons  the fan is less effective than a range hood  which is a given for any over the range microwave  and not as quiet as i would hope  br    br   other thoughts  the beep is long  but not much louder than any other microwave    i see a lot of comments about it  but it hasn t bothered us   overall  we like this microwave and are happy with the purchase  very good product quality  this is all i expected to get  br   i recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that  from the moment i took it out of the box  it looked beautiful  fit perfect in my small newly remodeled kitchen and works great  i put some money into my new kitchen with a very nice looking back splash in tile and glass  i did not want my old large white microwave oven taking up one entire wall  i don t use the microwave that much  so this is perfect   it s not all that powerful but if you are buying something to heat things up or make popcorn and you want style and beauty   this is it  i purchased this microwave and and a more expensive model   200   from williams sonomo and this whirlpool is a much better machine  the build quality is excellent and the veritcal ness of it saves space on the counter  had to return the williams sonoma model   the whirlpool is perfect for heating plates of food and leftovers in medium size bowls  br   at first  i missed the numeric key pad on my old over the stove model but the small size of this models doesn t allow for the large pad  however   after a short time you get used to pressing the start button to add time in increments of 30 seconds  super product that i would buy again and it looks cool  lousy value   stopped working after 2 years of relatively light use  1 2x a day   i was one of the unlucky owners of the previous version of this microwave  it worked fine for 2 years and then just stopped  whirlpool wasn t too helpful   offered me a warranty that cost more than buying a new one  then we wonder why we have a landfill issue like we do    whirlpool should be accountable  i m taking my money and buying another brand  br    br   when it worked  i generally liked it but the fan is loud and comes on by itself  i did like the auto defrost feature but i m sure others have that  we love this microwave  it looks great and has given us a lot more space in the corner where nothing but the old clunky microwave was  our kitchen looks so much more modern and the microwave itself fits everything  including our largest dinner plates   heating will require an additional 20 30 seconds but definitely worth the wait    can t say enough about how cool it looks  i have had the same problems as the others who wrote on here  i had a white over the range ge microwave that started having keypad problems  since i was upgrading to stainless appliances  i bought this one and after 3 yrs  started having problems with the keypad again  some of the buttons stopped working  then one night i woke up to a beeping sound and on the microwave display it said service immediately  i will not buy another ge appliance again  i would like to know what brand is a good one to go with  none available  i like the looks  the operation buttons on the bottom lends itself to a user friendly and a highly visible control panel  we have multiple samsung products  all exceed our expectations of their products br   there are no other microwaves on the market with bottom eye level control buttons had to replace 5 microwaves in 5 years   2 ge and 3 samsung microwaves that cost much more died premature deaths at my house  vacation condo  and gf s house  bought 2 of these so far and the first outlasted the 5  hope to have the same luck with this one  easy to install  user friendly instructions   came in good condition   manual very easy to understand and use micro oven   cooks in 1 2 the time when using fast back   really good product  bought this at christmas time to replace a ge conv micro that cost  1200  this is the slickest microwave you could imagine  works great and heats faster than the old ge  that cost 5 times more  if you want a ss microwave  to go over your stove  and dont want to break the bank  i couldnt say enough about this one  it works flawlessly  and performs with the best of them  br   with that said  i was very disapointed with the limited manual that comes with it  and owned it for a month  before i realized that that 99  of the info  that i was looking for  is on a label inside the door jam                    there is no mention of that fact in the manual  and all the codes  and info  i was searching for is printed right there on the bottom of the door jam  if you know where to look for it   so in closing this is a run to buy it purchase  and you will not be disapointed in the unit in anyway   read all the codes inside the doorjam on the bottom and life will be good for you      br   excellent plus on this unit  this is a good product  it replaced our previous profile spacemaker ii model which lasted about ten years   we re not exotic microwave users and choose the reheat feature 99  of the time   the new model works well  although my wife thinks our previous model had a hotter reheat temperature because we more frequently have to press the reheat button a second time with the new model   we also find the location of the clear off button confusing and sometimes fumble around looking for it   it should have been placed in an easier to find location  like on the top or bottom corner   we like the turntable which our previous model didn t have and think it helps heat the food more uniformly   overall  we re pleased with this product  i just installed this item  be careful with the lag screws provided  they are tin like and do strip out no matter what and cannot be loosened or tightened once the head strips  they require a special flat nose phillips head but that did not help  buy some quality mounting screws as   500 00  is not enough for ge to include those  and i hope the rest of the unit is not as cheap as the mounting screws  pollute the planet and make a extra trip to the hardware store  second  i was leveling the microwave and son of a gun  the magnet on my level stuck to the inside of the unit  which is supposed to be stainless steel  i would still prefer whatever this stuff is to the plastic interior that comes with non convection  the templates were perfect and put all the screws in the correct locations  you need to order the charcoal filter if you are using the recirculate rather than outside vented feature  to recirculate  you must unscrew 3 screws on top rear and rotate the fan housing 90 degrees before you install the unit  you also need to remove 2 screws on the upper front trim and slide in the filter then replace the trim  my 15 year old did both  you need to butt the top of the unit to the shelf above  or insert trim pieces around the top  if you don t  and let it hang even 1 2 inch  the unit can rise up if hit and fall off the shallow rear flanges that hold it to the back wall bracket and fall onto the new matching ge range  our cabinets had a wierd from the 1960 s lip on one side  i like old school stuff  and i needed to add the trim to prevent falling  the unit powered on and worked once we finished  will update after a few months of use  i am a licensed electrical and general contractor  so i hope this helps in getting it ready to install  took my son and i about an hour  the unit looks great in the kitchen  after months of research  it was between this and the sharp  but this had more power and capacity  and there was not a sharp in any showroom for qc comparison  hope itwas the correct choice  love this microwave  product was easy to install  and easier to operate  the first one we ordered came damaged  the process to return item was a piece of cake  the second one came  from a different company  and was packaged much much better  we used to have our microwave sitting on the counter  we remodeled our 1950 galley kitchen and only had room for a drawer microwave  we will never go back to any other microwave  well worth the price   br   love  love   love this product this was the perfect microwave for my kitchen remodel it is quite roomy  i particularly like the two stage fan and lighting features  i had it for about a year and a half now when the door is closed it just runs without producing heat   i guess i could get it repaired but i m wondering if it s worth it   i may just buy a better quality microwave so i don t have to deal with it again  we needed a small microwave for a small space  and this fits perfectly     but   very low power  takes a long time   not tall enough for many things  have to transfer contents to shorter vessels   extremely loud beeping that can t be turned off  i have been using this microwave for about a year  i will say the microwave works well as far as successfully heating items as a microwave should  other than that  i find it to be an awkward design in the following ways  br    br     the button for the light is directly under the   34 start  34  button  if you hit the   34 start  34  button  it automatically starts microwaving for 30 seconds  however  in a dimly lit room  i often accidentally hit the   34 start  34  button when i m just trying to turn the light on  i can  tell you how many times i have started a 30 second microwave cycle on an empty microwave  br     speaking of the lights there are two light bulbs underneath  which is fine  however  in the one year we ve been using this microwave  the same bulb has burned out twice  while the other has yet to burn out at all  the first time  we had to scour the internet for a replacement bulb only to find that the specific wattage of the bulb that came in the microwave is pretty much unavailable  anywhere  so we did some reading and learned to use a slightly lower wattage bulb  this took entirely too much research and hunting for what should have been a simple light bulb  br     the beeping at the end of the cooking  or timer  is quite obnoxious  it s 3 long  loud beeps  and  unlike every other microwave i ve ever used  it does not stop when you open the microwave door  i have young children and often stand directly in front of the microwave  waiting for the timer to hit 1 second so i can stop it before it beeps so it doesn t wake up anyone sleeping napping  br     there are lots of   34 convenience  34  setting  quick buttons   but i have never used a single one of them  seems like a bit of a waste of space and features  it has a   34 reheat  34  button  but  unlike some other microwaves on the market  it is not a   34 sensor  34  automatic reheat  so i m not sure what the purpose of it is when you could just as easily enter the amount of time and hit start like normal  br    br   overall  it looks nice enough and works as far as microwaving is concerned  but i personally think it comes with many flaws  none available  install went well but retrofiting the exterior vent was a chore but thats not a problem of the unit  only had it up and going for a short while but so far so good  this is the best microwave i have ever had   love the size and the program buttons are so nice  br    br   i use the bake potato button all the time  works as advertised  easy to follow installation instructions and cooks great  of course  the holes from my old  ewave  did not line up with this model  i went to open my microwave and the handle snapped    yup snapped off into pieces   frigidaire will so graciously allow me to buy a new one as their way of standing behind their product    yes so we purchase an expensive microwave that is made so cheaply that you have to replace the handle that breaks apart and they get more money yes that does sound right doesn t it   but they stand behind their products    so frustrating   unless you have money to burn on replacing parts don t buy this product              this microwave does not heat as quickly or as hot as we would like   it has some great features  but its performance is just not up to par for the price  i spent hundreds more for another   34 name  34  brand and this one is as good   cant beat this for the price i paid had this for about 5 years now after a panasonic nn h965wf failed within 19 months of being purchased new  no repairs necessary with this sharp microwave  and the sensor still works great  use that function and you ll almost never have to worry about underheated food  as described by phil  it is very easy to install   a tip  as you cut the 4 small taps to get to the motor  put a small tool or wire in the door hole to keep in from falling inside the unit   after you install the new motor  flip the door you cut out over  and the tab neatly fits the loop and the small screw hole lines up   use a small screw to attach the cut out door and it will be sealed from dust and dirt  as well as easily accessible if you ever need to open again  i purchased this unit to replace a ge spacemaker because it was the only one i could find that would fit in the cabinet space   the new unit would not heat food when it arrived   i am requesting an immediate replacement from the supplier   i recall when ge had a good reputation in appliances  but now i have a low opinion of their quality  i currently have one of these that fits perfectly in the space i have   bought this one again as a spare   just in case    and we know that case will come at the most inconvenient time   very happy with this 800w model   does my jobs  br     it is pretty good for my 1964 vintage wired house   too many things plugged in and too many watts required at the same time makes for too many trips to the fuse box  just like everyone else  i own this microwave  it died after 1yr of normal use right after the warranty ran out  when it worked there were no issues  this microwave came with my new home and overall  i am very pleased with it  it is sturdily built and has an attractive stainless steel finish and design  it does a great job at heating up and cooking food  and even though it may not have all of the features of a more expensive microwave  the features it does have  work well  i particularly like the turntable and the add 30 seconds button  the only downside i can think of is that it does not have the express 1 minute  2 minute  etc  buttons  when it comes to a microwave  simplicity in use is key and this one definitely fits the bill  i have very limited space so the design to fit in corner is great  i only use for re heating or defrosting so it is fine for that  some of my dinner plates are too large to fit in it   so i use smaller plates for re heating  i don t like the lack of number pad but i knew it didn t have one when i bought it  it does have it s own popcorn button      the motor fit perfect  works great  price was excellent  br   was much cheaper than new microwave a a a a plus all purchase and shipping activities were fine  microwave door on this model not well designed  it sticks and won t open or close properly if the unit is not perfectly level meaning installation under cabinet must be virtually perfect  appliance repair person told me this is always a problem with this model  wish i knew that before purchasing  plus   i ve had this microwave installed for about 4 months now and i really like it   it cooks evenly and in a predictable way   much better than the traditional turntable models   the coolness factor is high and its easy for the kids to use   i love how it fits in with my new kitchen  br   minus    it s pricey for a microwave   considering  the price i expected it to have a few more quick features  like a 30 second reheat button  it will do 1 min    the open close mechanism is noisy and closes with a   34 clunk  34     the special cooking features are complicated to program so i have yet to use them  br   summary   it was worth the splurge  this microwave worked fine while it lasted  about 2 years   it looks fine and wasn t too loud when the fan was on  but the fact that it didn t last any longer makes the features irrelevant   the price certainly was no better than comparable microwaves with much better longevity   i would not recommend this product  i bought this for myself about 2 years age and liked it so much that i bought the same one for my sister  i like it very much  its a perfect size  easy to use  has a button for baking potatoes and other items  i recommend it very highly  very smelly    br   be sure to scrape all rust out with steel wool  paint scraper  whatever it takes  the directions were minimal   i googled for more information  i bought this microwave about a year ago   the exterior is attractive  and it fit well into the space i had for it   however  after just one year of relatively infrequent use  the top of the cavity is flaking  with big chunks of paint now gone  i ve had to throw away things i ve cooked because there were flecks of paint falling from the top into my dish  it is ridiculous to have to replace a new and otherwise functional appliance  the replacement will not be a ge  a very compact  beautiful and sleek microwave   saves a on counter space and will accommodate a full size dinner plate  this was to replace a bad microwave in one of our condo s kitchen   it fit perfectly and looks good  thank you if you re looking for a space saver  this is the microwave for you   if fits so well in the corner of the counter top and i have twice the space i had when my old bulky clunker was still on the counter   i haven t found a plate yet that doesn t fit in the microwave and only one conatiner was too tall to fit  but even that wasn t critical   just used another container   the power is suffiecient for warming and cooking most foods   i do wish it had a few more watts  around 1000 would be perfect   over all the compromise in power is well worth the additional space   controls are very simple although  i do wish i could increase the time in more than 30 second increments  br    br   service was terrific   the first unit arrived damaged by the shipper   replacement was fast and problem free  good product but customer service is lacking  spent 36 minutes on hold after not being able to complete the online service request  microwave heats food quickly and thoroughly  fits a cup of coffee  dinner plate and popcorn  what else do you need  fits perfect in my cabinet out of site  this microwave works well  i wanted a microwave to heat my rice filled heating pad for my shoulders  it does that and doesn t take up too much space on the counter  i am very pleased  looks and works great so far    the vent is really nice and powerful too    a bit loud when you set it at the highest but sure does work when our old sharp   34 over the range  34  started to die  14 years of service and the display had become very dim and door starting to crack with quite large chips falling off we decided it had to be replaced   finding an over range  gas  with convection and a good extractor fan proved difficult and so we decided on this sharp product  at 71 lbs and with different mounting points from it s predecessor it was a difficult installation task   could not have been done by one person on their own  br   once in place however it is the greatest   it is better designed than the one before with 2 extractor inlets placed to handle the heat from the gas range very well   a large ceramic turntable that is easy to clean plus it can be selected to   34 not rotate  34  which permits bigger dishes to be used as needed  br    br   best of all it has a   34 keep warm  34  feature that allows warming serving plates as well as keeping unserved food ready  for   34 seconds  34  without the whole reheat cycle  br    br   great product   would have given 5 stars but for the physical difficulty of installation   in fairness that would have probably been much the same for any brand  microwave does it s job but door started sagging within first 30 days and the unit quit working within a year  we love this new appliance   just a few days before thanksgiving our old one died   i purchased a new one locally and after installation realized the door hinges are placed where we could not open the door more than a few inches   returned that one and went online and found this one at almost  100 00 less than what my local dealer could get it for me   he agreed that i should order thru amazon and not only did i receive it in less than a week  it fit  looks great and works perfectly  this is the second microwave and just like the first one it lasted less then a year  the magnetron fried  we bought a new one  it fried again  we fixed it and it happened a 3rd time  i will not buy another whirlpool product  the microwave in our new house had corrosion and under the turntable  i sanded and cleaned for about an hour then sprayed this paint  i did have a little overspray but it turned out pretty well  there s a spot that looks like i didn t sand and clean well enough but there is plenty of paint left in the can to re do it  it s good enough for now and the paint is holding up well after a month  the push latch for the door is very tricky   sometimes it opens the door at once   mostly it takes repeated efforts  this is the only microwave made that fits into my pre constructed custom cabinet space  my first one lasted 8 years   when it wouldn t turn off  i ordered a new one   the first one sent to me would not turn on   seems like something was wrong with the key pad  ge s fault not the distributor or amazon   called amazon and they credited me immediately and charged  sent me a new one the next day which worked perfectly   i just returned the first one in the original box with the scanner label they sent  we bought this mwo 20 months ago and were satisfied until the magnetron failed at 20 months  which is unacceptable   since the magnetron has a 10 yr warranty  we checked for local authorized repairmen  but there  were none close enough to make the repair worthwhile  since we have to pay for labor   check this out before you buy  i live in a small house  400 sf  so i don t have much room for anything  this may be too soon for a review  as i just received the microwave y day  but so far it s just perfect  i love that the controls are on the bottom instead of on the side  as my microwave cubby is only 16 5 inches wide  i like the style and the easy setup  as well  it s perfect for an apartment  dorm room  or office kitchen  br    br   one thing to note   on the inside left wall  if you re facing the microwave   there s what looks like a cardboard panel screwed into the wall by the vent  there isn t anything definitive about what to do about this panel  and since it looks like it could possibly be removed  i called whirlpool customer service to get some clarification  long story short   don t remove the panel  it s supposed to be there  br    br   other than that momentary confusion  i m really happy with this product  item was what was advertised  in condition advertised and delivered on time  that s all you can ask of a supplier  you must prepare the area where you are going to use the paint  takes a lot of sanding and preparing  but the result of spraying even coats is great  i bought this microwave almost a year ago  love it  quality is good enough   i do not use it too often   i really in love with the design  this is a really nice little microwave   just what i was looking for   no complaints   it was shipped quickly by the supplier  too   the controls are simple and elegant  and the surfaces are easy to clean   i would buy it again  so far so good  replaced a samsung and the existing bracket worked  much quieter than the one replaced  my wife loves the br   melt soften function  i have to echo previous reviews  we got this microwave because it fit in with our stainless steel appliances after we redid our kitchen  it s actually a great microwave  i think  it looks great and the settings features are really nice  but  a little bit after the 1 year warranty ran out  part of the keypad became defective  the numbers  some of the other buttons worked so we could still partly use it while we diddled around before finally calling the repair technician  he came out  took one look at it and told us that it would be more expensive to repair it than to just buy a new one  called and complained to ge  and we were able to score a ge credit worth almost the price of another microwave  we had specific space look criteria  so we had to end up buying the same one  it s only a matter of time before it goes  too  br    br   to add another note  my college apartment has the exact same microwave  only in white instead of stainless steel  the keypad also broke one day  and when i called to get it fixed they came out the next day and replaced the whole thing  apparently it happens so often they have a few of them just sitting around as replacements  br    br   i m giving it 2 stars because  while it is prone to breaking  it is at least a really functional attractive microwave and we didn t have to pay very much on a replacement  if you only need a microwave for 1 year or less  it s a good buy  any longer  which will be most people  find a different brand  i have only had this installed for several days and have not used all functions  but so far it seems like a good machine  and when that is the most positive thing you can say about an appliance you know there isn t much left to work with   the power is lacking and the controls are confusing   it s the year 2012  there is no reason to need to keep the instruction manual for a microwave oven handy so guests can use it   i gave it two stars because it does free up extra counter space  motors turn at the correct speed and are powerful enough to power my project of a miniature barber pole and the price was good  loved this microwave when it worked    br   i never had a problem with its cooking functions  lived swore by the sensor reheat  and did what it was supposed to   the problem i encountered was that after owning it for about a year and a half  it suddenly stopped working   i d set the time and hit start  the light inside would come on  the clock would count down  but neither the turntable would turn nor would the microwave actually start cooking  br   i drove it to a sharp certified technician  and about  65 later  it worked fine   at least  for another year or so   repeated the process  paid another  65  and then it worked fine  this time  for another year   thanks to the economy  my sharp certified technician lost his business  and now i had to drive it over an hour away if i wanted it fixed  br   i brought it to a sears service center  where they fixed it for about  50  and they said there was a problem with some kind of safety latch with the door   this time  it lasted about 6 months   i agree with other users  that every microwave on the market has some kind of issue   it s time to accept the fact that we want these machines to do more than they could 15 years ago  and either the craftsmanship isn t there  or our appliances simply can t handle the demands anymore   i guess 5 years is a decent lifetime now  sadly  this is the second sharp r 1405  over the range microwave i have owned  the first one lasted 8 years and gave me excellent service  so i was thrilled when i found the same model still being produced  i snatched it up and easily installed it because the same install hardware was required and 90  of the mounting hardware was already installed in the wall above the stove  not only that  the price was about  200 or  300 less than comparable over the range microwaves  an excellent product that gets the job done     i highly recommend it  for some strange reason  my microwave turntable plate just cracked in half   i didn t have a part number so went by brand and size and found the perfect replacement through an amazon vendor   the order was shipped quickly and our microwave is usable again   we are very happy and would recommend the vendor and product  when the turntable on my sharp microwave stopped turning  i went on line to find a substitute   some years ago i had a turntable that worked independently of the microwave   simple device   works by winding it up  much like an old fashioned alarm clock  br    br   after googling turntable  i came upon this little motor and thought   34 why not   34   i can do this   i know nothing about electronics  so i realized that by taking the microwave apart to make the fix  i might destroy it  but it wasn t working anyway so i decided to gamble and order the part  br    br   i very carefully opened up the microwave  after disconnecting it from the power  and located the motor that turned the turntable   it was simple  fairly intuitive  to remove and replace  and for a very small amount of money  i fixed the microwave   i ve had this microwave for seven plus years and now i expect to get another seven  very possibly more  br    br   overall     one of my best buys on amazon  very attractive and functional microwave  that was easy to install as a replacement for a ge microwave that no longer worked  needed a new stainless steel microwave  works well  nice and big  it is only stainless on the front  black everywhere else  works well so far    this is an excellent product  it has variable intensity settings and just enough features to be easy to use  its not only nice looking  but consumer reports rates it as one of the best  the stainless steal body makes it easy to clean and it fits any kitchen decor  used this microwave as a built in  i had a specific width opening in some shelving and wanted the most cu ft and features in this width  only been using it for a couple weeks however it has met my expectations  the body of this unit is black so if you are looking for an all stainless for countertop use this would not be the one  this microwave sucks and so does the seller     i purchased this microwave in april because i was remodeling my kitchen and was upgrading to this better quality stainless steel over the range microwave   well how i said i purchased it in april  but didn t install it until the beginning of august   the delivery was fast  but when i reccieved it  two of the back corners were dented  but i decided to install it anyways because it was in the back anyways and nobody would ever see it   it is now october and it has gone out on me   i was about to warm up my dinner when i pressed start and boom it went out   it turned off just like that   it never turned back on  i am really dissapointed becasue i thought i had purchased a good quality product   i contacted the seller and he said to call samsung and they would cover it since its still under warranty   well it is under warranty  but the thing is it turns out this is a refurbished unit when the seller says he purchased it new from lowes   he s a liar becasue lowes does not sell refurbished units   so now i m out a couple hundred     and now i have to purchase a new one   people please listen to the reviews and don t buy this microwave  whether it s her or some other place   save yourselves time  money  and dissapointment   also  do not buy from this seller he is sooo unproffesional and not helpfull  i only give it one star because i have to give it a 1 5 or else i would give it a 0  this is the third model of this microwave i have bought   since i do a lot of cooking with my microwave  i enjoy all the features this one has   particularly  the   34 baked potato  34  and   34 sensor reheat  34  functions   not only was i overjoyed to find the exact model  i saved over  70 on my replacement   i was also pleasantly surprised when it arrived three days after my order  this microwave fits perfectly with our ge cafe gas range  which is why we bought it  it s quite heavy   apparently due to the built in convection oven  disappointing is the plastic handle  which look like stainless steel  but isn t   i expect more from an  800 appliance   also  if you plan to vent this into the kitchen  make sure you have a cabinet over the microwave that is not more than 13 inches deep   the microwave vents are on top of the front of the microwave and blow straight up   other microwaves have vents that fold open  which is a really cool idea  again  the ge cafe falls short here   hence  only three stars for now   i will update this as we use it more  this whirlpool wmc2005yw 0 5 cubic feet countertop microwave oven is the best microwave we have ever had  we sold our house  where we had a built in micro  and moved into a condo 4 years ago and bought a small haier  the only thing good about the haier was   it was small  so when it blew out we had to go small again  i totally counted on the reviews for this micro and  thank you everybody  you are so right  i got the white one because my counters are white and it is so cute  just nestled into that small space  the best part is that it really works well  we feared making popcorn  which the haier never  and i mean never  did well  always burnt no matter what we tried  this whirlpool made perfect popcorn at 2 1 2 minutes  we snack on it every night and the bag fits in perfectly with room to spare  it will fit a dinner plate easily and heats evenly  there is a 30 second button  start  stop  and a clock that also doubles as a timer  we have never used the auto buttons  i would buy this again in a minute  everything is great    just a warning     double check the template used for the upper cabinet  actually check it against the unit  in my case i replaced an older maytag  so i had two existing holes in my cabinet  then added two more because of the template only to fine that they do not line up       i superimposed the template over the unit and sure enough the holes did not line up    so i did not make a mistake     the template was off  no real big deal but now i have six holes  br    br   double check the holes    unit is great   previous unit did not vent out of the house  this one i installed a vent to the outside through the back and it has a really powerful motor  this microwave gives you three options vent back vent from the top or recirculate  i do not reccomend recirculating     if you can vent this unit or any unit always vent     i had some major issues venting this unit because of structural issues  like wires that i had to reroute etc but i knew that when it was over i would be smiling and i am     for the price this unit works as good as any for much more money and the vent is the greatest      i needed a small microwave for my small kitchen and this one fits the bill   why aren t there more small appliances out there  oh right  we live in the u s   where bigger is supposedly better   br    br   anyway  this microwave has performed fine so far  powerful enough for reheating leftovers in a timely manner   it doesn t heat very evenly  but in my experience  most microwaves don t  if it s soup  no problem  just stir  if it s a frozen burrito  the ends will be bubbling while the middle is still frozen  annoying  br    br   however  the biggest complaint after having this microwave for just one month is that there is a thin layer of plastic over the control buttons and it is already scratched and peeling off in some places  makes me concerned about the overall quality of this thing  bought ge s 2006 model  it became a bread box clock four days ago  about 9 15 2012   scheduled one of their authorized repair men  took him 5 minutes to determine that the only problem was that the microwave generator thingy quit  the display  oven light and turntable are as good as new  but the micro doesn t heat anything  cost of the part    400  the good news is that the  75 house call will be offset by getting a coupon redeemable for  100 if i buy another ge profile over the range  my cheap  little  off brand counter top microwave just won t quit working  i m not certain what to do  br    br   one last thing  the halogen surface light quit about six weeks after original purchase  you have to stand on your head  and use a special backhanded screw driver to replace the bulbs  very convenient feature  but maybe i should have paid an authorized repair tech to replace the bulbs  my old microwave  dating back to the mid 90s  finally bit the dust   i was worried that i wouldn t find another compact microwave to replace it  but this one fits the bill   it is small  but big enough for the needs of our 3 person household   i find height to be more limiting that width in microwaves  and this one offers about the same height as a regular one   it s not as powerful as some of the full sized microwaves  but an extra minute of waiting is worth it for the small footprint   it s attractive although the buttons are not terribly intuitive   the rounded back works well for our needs  as it nestles into the corner even better than our previous unit   after a few months of use  i m quite pleased with this purchase  i have been using this microwave for four years now without any issues  a nice deep oven with a really powerful fan  good results every time i use it  i purchased this to replace a much larger microwave taking a lot of counter space   since we only use a microwave to reheat food and pop popcorn  this microwave is perfect   i held off using it for several weeks because the inside wall of the microwave had a rectangle piece of cardboard screwed into the side with a metal and some plastic screws   i removed the screws and cardboard but there were no instructions to tell me to remove it   once removed  there was a rectangle hole on the inside wall that was next to the turntable plate   my old microwave didn t have an open space   my concern was that if i heat soup  it could run over the bowl and spill inside this open space   it still doesn t make sense to me because the cardboard couldn t have been meant to be left in since it can t be wiped down when cleaning the inside of the microwave   oh well  this mini micro works great and heats everything we need to the correct temp using the approximate times i used on my old microwave   yes  i d purchase this again but i ll also be purchasing a rubber mat to place under it because it slides around when opening or closing the door  keypad error se    185 to repair   i m getting a new microwave  but can t seem to find a good review on any of them from someone who had it more than 1 year  after about 18 months of working beautifully  we also got that se error  called an authorized dealer and between the cost of a service call  the price of labor and the price of the new keypad  it will cost  200 to fix   no way    i will be purchasing a new microwave and it will most definitely not be a samsung   time to issue a recall like they do with cars   they know who has registered this product  we should all be given replacement keyboards free of charge  we need lemon laws for appliances  i urge you to stay away from this one  br    br      update    br   i spoke with the authorized service provider and he suggested i contact samsung directly  1 800 726 7864   i spoke with customer service and then was transferred to executive customer relations  they first offered me a free replacement part but told me i would have to pay for the service call and any labor charges  i told her that was not acceptable as that would still cost me  135  she put me on hold again and came back telling me she could give me as a courtesy a one time only warranty extension  she made it clear it would not ever be repeated  so  at least now i will have the repair done at no cost to me  hopefully the new part will last longer than the original   i suggest you try giving them a call if you are one of the many with this problem  this product initially worked very well   within a few months  we found that the microwave would come on all by itself   it totally quite working in about 1 5 years   i have read many complaints just like this one   it should have been recalled by the manufacturer   i will never buy this brand again  very happy with this purchase  for the money  great product  br    br   i was a little concerned  because some had mentioned the clunky door  but i find no problems with it  recall needed   this problem has existed for over 8 years in the same model microwave from g e  it is not safe  once the white coating peels away and metal is exposed the unit will spark and can cause a kitchen fire     the white coating is bubbling and peeling off of the inner top surface of my microwave  it was manufactured in march 2011 and installed in june 2011  just over a year ago  the current unit was a replacement for the exact same built in unit that also was just over a year old and experiencing the same problem  if you purchase one of these units  be sure to purchase an extended warranty     if you read the comments at the ge community forum you will see that this problem has existed for years  same product  same model number  same problem over and over  but ge has done nothing to correct it  read the details at this link            although  it is a useful unit otherwise   lots of great features  but once the coating starts bubbling and peeling you cannot safely use it  total hazard  additionally  unless this unit is installed over a range users are probably operating the unit without knowing it is in an unsafe condition because they cannot see the coating peeling away on the top inner surface     why has ge not recalled this product  we have had this microwave for just over a year   one month after warranty we got an se error code   in doing some research we found over 200 complaints about it on the samsung web site   with a lot of complaining we got them to authorize a free service call  i bought this microwave 18 months ago from sears and it looked good and worked just fine until the se error message came up a week ago  then the keypad stopped working  we tried plugging and unplugging  and i have tried all of the fixes found online but to no avail  i am now planning to replace it with a quality product  so much for buying a good looking product that reviewers say works well  i want my appliances to last more than a year and half  i have a super small kitchen and this microwave fits perfectly inside  it works great and looks pretty cool   i was hesitant about it fitting a large dinner plate but it does    so  it works for all my needs  maybe the only downside is that you can basically only set it in 30 second intervals but that is normally the type of microwave cooking i do anyway so it s fine for me  we bought this microwave for our kitchen remodel partly because we also have this same unit in our motorhome  br   the combination of an outside hood vent  range light  convection oven  and microwave made it a bargain as well  br   the shipping was perfect  it was packed in 2 boxes  first the manufacture s styro lined box  then that box was bubble wrapped and boxed in a separate larger box  br   the stainless steel matches our other appliances and looks great  br   thanks sharp  thanks amazon this oven made it about a year before the interior paint started peeling off   customer service was not helpful   this oven cost us at least twice what comparable ovens cost   we bought it because it fit the space we had available   never again  everyone who visits my apartment always comments on how cool my microwave looks   this powerful machine is perfect for the typical manhattan kitchen   if you are looking for a stylish  functional and space saving microwave   then buy this one  i have only been using the product about one month but am very pleased so far   it is well designed and solves the problem i had of bending down all the time to access the microwave   easy to install  looks good   some reviewers have reported quality problems though i ve had none so far   i will update my review if it fails i ordered this microwave to replace an over the over microwave we had that stopped working  we wanted something small since we realized we don t use on much anymore except for frozen vegetables and reheating coffee  we needed a small microwave that would fit in a small area  this was the only corner model microwave i could find anywhere online  it is very cute and looks like an old school television set  the controls are very simple  there is no number pad  you use the   and   minus signs to adjust cook time  this microwave also has a built in timer  which was also very nice  at only 750 watts  it seems to cook at the same rate as out old 1100 watt microwave  br   although the price was  higher that a comprable sized microwave  the size and shape make it worth the extra money  this is my first lg microwave and it will be my last   glass plate is not as heat resistant and breaks easily while cooking food   customer service was even less helpful   buyer beware     if this ge profile microwave is built like its cousin  the pvm1870  beware of the worst quality control and internal components possible   in the two years we have owned a pvm1870 profile  it has had 6 service calls and about every electronic part but the magnetron has been replaced  several components have been replaced twice   i can accept and understand an electronic component failing  but not that many with some replaced twice    does not speak well of either quality internal components  quality internal engineering or quality control   the only reason that i gave it one star is that a zero star rating is not possible  br    br   addendum  br   the motor power supply burned up again    plus another service call for the vent door not opening any longer   now we are up to 8 service calls on the extended warranty   this ge product is an absolute piece of junk and the last ge product we will ever own   btw    the service personnel are excellent and know their jobs    it is strictly the lack of build quality and quality control for this ge product that has caused so many failures   it does not deserve any stars in the rating  this was a reeplacement purchase   our previous unit had no issues and was locally purchased   the door was accidentally damaged and could not be easily repaired   needed exact replacement for previously purchased trim kit although product reviews concerning   within 2 weeks the electronic key board routinely malfunctioned   often requires multiple attempts to start   contacted seller who defered back to ge   not the kind of service i expected nor previously experienced with an amazon vendor   my recommendation is to avoid both  vendor and product if possible  i love this little microwave oven   i just reheat food and cook some frozen dinners  so i wanted something that wasn t a counter space hog  was easy to open and easy to clean  and didn t have a lot of fancy options that i never use   previous reviewers have noted that the beep is loud when adding time  and that the seconds have to be added in 5 second increments  so there s a lot of pushing the   button   so i guess there s still room for improvement  but it does exactly what i want it to   what i particularly like is the solid face without buttons sticking out of it   very easy to wipe clean  no worries about liquid getting into the circuitry  i love this microwave   it is the perfect size for a small space  it looks nice  and it cooks well for a 750 watt   the first one i received would not latch and whirlpool took care of sending me a new one and picking up the old one  even though i did not purchase it directly from them  we got ours three years ago when we redid our appliances and it has been the workhorse of my kitchen   i cook everything in my microwave and it s so smart it knows how to cook  defrost or reheat everything   it has been durable and dependable  it s large and versatile   i have only had to replace a plate  i m a klutz  and the handle  20 yr old doesn t know his own strength    if you want the best microwave ever  get it  have owned this microwave for about 2 5 years  has been a great performer albeit a bit longer cooking times because of it s low wattage  however  about 6 months ago the interior paint began to chip  there is now about one third of the inside paint missing  have read numerous complaints regarding this problem on other sites so ours is not an isolated incidence  most consumer info that is available states that the chipping paint is not unsafe  i don t know about you but i don t prefer my food with paint chips in it  i m sure soon it will start sparking from all of the exposed metal  haven t replaced it yet as we can t find a replacement to fit our space requirements  my wife wanted this item after conducting a great deal of internet research on it  i had been used to using a 10 year old microwave and did not think i would be that impressed with this new model  i was wrong  this is one of the best appliances that i ve ever purchased  absolutely love it  takes up very little counter space   large inside  great height  would highly recommend  purchesed for a cleaner counter look and that is exactly what i have  many compliments from guests  everyone wants to know where they can order one  after installing a new double oven to replace a single with a microwave combo i was left in need of a countertop microwave  it had to be small so as not to take up counterspace and i needed blue display lights to match all of my other appliances  light displays  things like that annoy me   black or silver   all my appliances are stainless and my granite is black  this is perfect  fits in the corner and easy to use  looks like an odd little tv   which i like since i like quirky looking things that do their job  i boght several other microwaves these past few weeks  pure stainless   blck   larger   even the nostalgia retro one   all went back   this one is perfect  i don t do major cooking in a microwave and if takes a few seconds longer  well  it really does not matter as we are all in too big of a rush anyway   this arrived incredibly fast and features were as advertised   however  do be aware that the height is listed as 15 and 1 2 and this was a primary consideration as i was replacing a microwave in a tight space   sure enough  the front is 15 and 1 2  however  the unit slopes to 16 and 1 2 at the back  kids love to use it wife does too  works under bar  it is a perfect space saver  hard to break  love it  purchased jan  2004   just stopped working 6 12   i m guessing the magnetron blew   just past the 7 year warranty for that part  so after researching several other microwave ovens  i will replace with the same model   i hope they are using the same manufacturing process    one problem early on was fixed quickly and with full support of customer service  under warranty   br    br   pros  br   i have used this microwave daily  usually several times a day for 8 years   in contrast to one reviewer  my ceramic turntable is as clean as the day i got it   yes  i take it out and clean it whenever it gets a spill  either in the dishwasher or by hand    couple of spots on the inside of the unit  br   i like the clean appearance of having a unit without any handles on the outside  br    br   cons  br   not be the roomiest interior   listed clearly in the specs  br   exhaust fan doesn t seem to do much of anything  but i live in a nyc apt that is not set for external exhausting   so my installation is a  recirculating  one   i m glad i have a large window right next to my range  br    br   n a  br   i haven t used the special settings too often  so can t remark on them  i have had this microwave less than 2 years and i too am getting the se error code   it is  99 just for someone to look at it   you can t press any of the buttons   this obviously is a manufacturer issue if there are so many complaints about it   now i have to spend another  300 on a new microwave not samsung  i don t find this microwave any noisier than others i ve owned  i also find it very easy to use even without reading the instructions  so far it heats food evenly and is pretty powerful  great basic  affordable microwave  replaced an existing otr microwave that had a burnt out magnetron  it s been several months since install  and i am still very happy  br    br   1  carousel works  br   2  has a convenient 30 second or single button push for 1 9 minute intervals can warm up small dishes or teas with the 30 second quickstart  br   3  nukes food up really quickly  br   4  very easy to install  even with a old house  i used the printed template to drill guideholes and place in the retention frame  took me two hours  and i was able to pop it in place all by myself  br   5  vent does a good job at sucking  br    br   got it in fast  and in great condition  if you need a cheap replacement  this is it  this is a great small microwave  it fits in a small area  replaces an existing  this works much better  do recommend two days in and i couldn t be happier with this purchase  small foot print  excellent build quality and yet holds a full size plate  it s also the quietest microwave i have ever owned  you can barely hear it  the lcd is super bright and the controls are so easy to use  i love how the entire front sure is flat   makes for really easy clean up  i would so buy this again and again  i brought a samsung smh9187st back nov  2010  which is the same exact microwave as the smh 1816s with the exaact same features listed  on june 14  2011  i had a technician come to my home to repair this unit  this unit was under warranty at the time  on may 6 2012  samsung microwave display se on the screen  call samsung office and they referred me to a service tech  also  stating the unit was not under warranty regardless of the last repair date  i call the service tech  office somewhere in norcross ga to find out what it would cost for a visit to my home  the office employee not the tech   stated the tech  visit for my area would be  140 00 to look at and replace the unit part which would cost  75 00  total cost  215 00 the employee that was not a tech  quoted me the cause of my problem and the part that cause the problem without some even looking at the unit  sounds like the repair company already have a lot of information without every touching or looking at this samsung microwave unit  this appears to be an on going problem with this unit even though the on thing that has change is the model number samsung smh1816s  br   if  you have not had a problem in the first year consider yourself lucky  when you have had two problems in 18 months with this unit it is time for a recall on your product  stay away from this microwave unless you don t mind an inconvenience and spending more money  purchased this product from warehouse deals  fulfilled by amazon  which was advertised as used but in good condition  microwave oven arrived april 28  2012  the product did not work and the door was damaged  contacted ge tech support who dispatched a repair tech to my home on may 1  2012  who indicated the door was bent and the microwave had internal damage  he also stated he would ship the parts to my home and when they arrived to call ge for him to return  on may 5  2012 the parts arrived  notified ge immediately and a tech representative  would be responding monday may 7  2012  i don t know if this product  had damage before it was shipped by warehouse deals or it was destroyed in transit by ups  i will keep this situation updated as time progresses then either keep the rating or change it  just a note   reading all the bad reviews on this particular ge profile spacemaker microwave oven  pem31smss  i m contemplating  having additional problems with this particular ge microwave  i really had no choice  this unit replaced my old ge profile spacemaker microwave  jem31sf01  that was built into a custom kitchen cabinet  as i required the exact dimensions screw lineup for the interior metal holding frame and the stainless steel trim covers  br    br   update 5 9 12  the ge technical representative responded to my residence monday 5 7 2012 who subsequently replaced the front door and some internal electronic parts  the new door still did not align properly with the frame  the rep contacted ge and informed them of the continuous failure of the door not to align correctly  a decision was made to replace the entire unit with a new replacement  i will keep this situation updated if and when the new microwave arrives from ge  br    br   update  5 17 12  a brand new microwave was delivered to my home and installed by a installation repair company sub contracted by ge  one of the installers from this third party company advised me this specific ge profile spacemaker microwave oven  pem31smss  is their  1 problematic ge microwave  for the reason that the inside paint peels off within 3 to 6 months of use  the gentleman also indicated they exchange these microwave s more than any other ge microwave  with all this latest documentation and all the negative reviews on this particular model  pem31smss  what s the probability of my new microwave lasting the test of time         mediocre to put it mildly  as i previously indicated  i had no recourse  since i needed a replacement to fit into a custom cabinet  with the correct dimensions screw lineup for the interior metal holding frame and the stainless steel trim covers  these two items cost more than the entire microwave alone  in conclusion  i would recommend everyone to purchase a different model ge or a different brand all together oven  pem31smss  is their  1 problematic ge microwave  for the reason that the inside paint peels off within 3 to 6 months of use  the gentleman also indicated they exchange these microwave s more than any other ge microwave  with all this latest documentation and all the negative reviews on this particular model  pem31smss  what s the probability of my new microwave lasting the test of time         mediocre to put it mildly  as i previously indicated  i had no recourse  since i needed a replacement to fit into a custom cabinet  with the correct dimensions screw lineup for the interior metal holding frame and the stainless steel trim covers  these two items cost more than the entire microwave alone  in conclusion  i would recommend everyone to purchase a different model ge or a different brand all together  whirlpool s description of this microwave is spot on  br    br   the only thing that would be nice would be a numeric keypad  but there really isn t space given the compact design  br    br   we have oversized dinner plates  and they fit in here with very little to spare  which means this microwave is perfect for us  we bought this mainly because it had to be the same size as our old one  to fit into a space in our cabinets  and this was the closest  a bonus was the turntable  which my husband really likes   it is larger inside than the old one  and more powerful  in the same space   we have used it 4 months now with no issues at all   the door does close and open rather hard  so we ease it closed  otherwise we love it  the controls are very easy to use   we had a bit of trouble installing it  we could not get the bottom slots in the microwave  to slip onto the bracket  so we just bent the bottom of the bracket so the microwave sits on on it  and it is screwed to the cabinet from the top   a good choice if it becomes available again  i purchased the danby as a gift for my nephew who has a small apartment  i selected it mainly due to the price  less than 60 bucks at walmart  and the fact that it takes up little counter space  although i was not expecting much in terms of features  i ve been really impressed with this  br    br   it offers a wide range of programming features  there are 6 one touch buttons so you can set 1 to 6 minutes of cooking time with one key press  it also has an add 30 seconds feature that can be used at start up or while the microwave is already running  there are also a host of timing options for cooking and defrosting  br    br   it looks really nice   much better than i was expecting  pretty decent stainless steel trim on the front and the handle  and a black casing  looks like it cost a lot more  easy to clean  and the handle keeps fingerprints away from the front  one difference from the picture    the key pad is all black  and not white and black as in the photo  br    br   the 0 9 capacity is just right  i also have a 0 7 capacity machine  but that has a problem with any dish that s larger than 11 inches  the 0 9 gives you a decent amount of interior space  but doesn t take up much more counter space than the 0 7  br    br   it has 900 watts of power  and does a good job of heating foods quickly  the interior light is bright and comes on when the unit is running or the door is open  reasonably quiet when it is running   typical noise level for a microwave  br    br   can t speak to reliability as of yet  but it comes with a 12 month warranty that is extended to 18 months if you register it online  br    br   great machine if you re looking for something that is small  but still very usable  highly recommend  perfect replacement for my old one   it is deeper than my old one but not to an extreme   i can nuke larger items now  i ve had a white one for 21 years  i had to install a new cap for our new range vent  anything that lasts that long with no maintenance makes the purchase decission a no brainer  only issue is that it only comes in black  but a rustoleum white spray can will fix that  oh  and it s kind of hard to find in stores  finally found a lowes close to my work that carried it  just purchased this microwave and it is so loud that it seems like there is a semi tractor trailer idling in my kitchen  we could neither hear the television nor have a normal volumed conversation with it on   everything else on the unit seemed great  but won t get to explore them as we will be returning it  i received the item before the expected date package and it s contents were intact  no issues at all with delivery  br    br   i used it the day i received it  after reading the many helpful hints in these online reviews  it was very simple and easy to use  it works great for me  for small loads in my apartment i live alone and don t have large amounts of laundry to wash  br    br   the tube they supply to fill up the tub didn t fit onto my faucet  but i have a plastic pitcher i used to fill it  three pitchers full  easy peasy   when in use  it sits right on my kitchen counter and the drain tube empties the water directly into my sink  the panda is fairly quiet  if i have music or the tv on  i can t hear it at all  br    br   it s really been a huge help to me  and i use it often  i am planning on getting a mini electric dryer as well  then i will only have to visit the laundrymat once a month  if that  i highly recommend the panda it s just so darn cute  and works like a charm with small loads  this microwave has had one problem after another since it was installed close to a year ago  it s prone to all sorts of computer malfunctions  let s see if i can even remember them all  we ve had it start up again after pulling food out and closing the door  without hitting start again   it s often  50  times  sounded as if it was working  but when i realized it had been an awfully long time without it chiming  i found that it had frozen just a few seconds into the heating  the most disturbing problem was that it has on perhaps five occasions turned on on its own  with no one in the room  there have been many occasions where it has just not worked at all  when this happened  unplugging it and plugging it back in used to reset it so that it would work  unfortunately  it now won t work at all  with just the code  se flashing on its display  br    br   we re buying a new microwave this weekend  and i can guarantee it won t be a samsung  picked this up at our local lowes for a good price  this model has the real stainless handle  and not the painted grey handle i saw on a lower end model  we installed it with minimal problems for our kitchen out of the 1960 s that usually has non standard things  finding a fridge that fit was very painful   we needed one with a low clearance distance to the cook top   14 inches or less  and samsung meets the bill at 13 inches  after using a counter top microwave for the past few years  this seems huge  i m still learning all the features  but am certainly pleased by the power of the fan  i m exploring the use of the sensor cooking and can t wait to use the rack to be able to actually cook the amount of squash i want at once   the old microwave was just too small  i ll update this review if i run into any problems as we run it through it s paces  but so far it was relatively easy to install and is easy to use  i bought this microwave based on the consumer reports product ratings and up until a couple of days ago i would have highly recommended it  unfortunately that is no longer the case  i awoke to sounds of it beeping every few minutes and an error code of se  after a lot of research i have seen that this same code has appeared for a fair amount of others  both the short and the long of it is that it can no longer be used with out spending good money after bad  i know that they don t make things now days to last a lifetime  but i would have hoped for it to last longer than less than 2 years  we are light users and i kept it very clean  i wish that i would have bought an extended warranty  i can only hope that i go the same way this did   quick and without warning and that someone would also say she was good while she lasted  not many reviews about this danby unit  i replaced another 900 watt hamilton beach unit with this one  the main reason was the h b unit light was off when the door was opened  aside from that it was a good unit  i gave it away  br   this danby does have the interior light on when you open the door  this makes it easier to remove hot beverages without fumbling and spills  it is somewhat louder than the old one  it makes a humming noise when running  all make some noise  but this is almost annoying  br    br   at 900 watts you can expect moderate cook times  the table turns slower than others  the old one made one revolution in 10 seconds  this one takes about 13  seconds  no big deal  but when heating a cup of coffee  the handle might be in the rear of the oven when finished heating  in other words  it was easier to use multiples of 10  like 60 seconds  and have the handle of a cup right there in front  br    br   aside from that it runs fine  no comment on quality since it too new to judge  at these lower prices they are pretty much throw aways when they die  like the other reviewer this unit was purchased at walmart  i buy lots from amazon and have alwaye been highly satisfied with service and products  it was simply cheaper at  73 total price with tax    asin b000uw1ww8 ge profile   jes2251sj 2 2 cu  ft  countertop microwave with child lockout and extra large br   capacity br   i purchased this product less than two years ago   today it finally just stopped this was considered a very good micro  however it should have lasted much longer  i no longer have any faith in ge products and would never recomend this product to anyone  this is the first 1 200 watt microwave i ve ever owned  it took just a while to figure out i didn t need things to heat as long  but once i figured it out  it is the best microwave i ve ever owned  the only drawback i have is i wish the completed beeper was louder  other than that  i am thoroughly satisfied with this microwave  if you put something in this microwave that is too tall  its easy to do because it doesn t have the same height as a regular microwave  it will knock it over when the motorized door closes   it also does not have a spinning turn table so you have to rotate food   initially thought the motorized door was cool  but it takes a few extra seconds to open and close which can be frustrating  everything so far seems to be working great   we ve only owned it for a few weeks but other than it being just a bit noisier than the old one we replaced  we are very happy with it   also the power is the same as the one we replaced it for but it seems to take about 15 20  longer cooking time than the old one   the size of the microwave is larger than the old one  so maybe that is the reason it takes longer to cook   other than that i would still buy the same microwave over again if i had to do it all over again   great deal for the money  after just two and a half years of use  the paint  is it really paint     is peeling off the inside top in large pieces  no doubt we ve eaten more unnoticeable bits  the microwave is built in  anybody find a better one with the same dimensions  we bought this oven based upon our son s usage of an earlier model   there aren t that many drawer microwaves available   why buy a drawer microwave   well  the most important reason is that my wife wanted one in our new house   her arguments were as follows   1  no need to lift or inspect foods over her head  2  made space for a vent  while microwaves can generally be vented from the front or the above  top   our new house didn t have any vent   so  all cooking fumes were vented into the room   with this oven  we removed the cabinet above the existing microwave and installed a stainless steel vent hood  above the range    still  not perfectly ventalated   i had to modify a base cabinet near the stove to accept the drawer microwave   not a problem for me as i am a woodworker  but a problem or extra costs for others   in addition  i had to add an electrical outlet   not a problem for me as i am a retired electrical engineer  but maybe a cost for others   after the installation  simple enough  the drawer didn t want to stay closed   that is  you push the close button and the drawer closed but re opened immediately   i was about to call for service but i did the following   push the drawer closed manually  that is by hand   this seemed to work and then the automatic closure mechanism started working okay   so  no service call required   the only shortcomings i see are that the power is not as great as our prior microwave and that there isn t a rotating table   dispite this  we are happy with this model so far after about a year   shorter people may like this oven a lot  and  it is really cool   so  i would recommend this oven  i love this microwave   it takes up barely any space on the counter  and the cord is well hidden behind it   it works fine for just heating things up and defrosting   the only thing to be aware of is that this really is a tiny microwave  you can fit a full size dinner plate  but there is not a lot of height inside   i couldn t use my microwave rice cooker in this because it was too tall  so i had to purchase a counter top rice cooker instead  which doesn t seem to work as well   other than that  this microwave looks good on the counter and does the job  i ve had two service calls with this microwave within the one year warranty   if it goes again  they tell me i am on my own  shame on whirlpool  i suspect that it may be more efficient to purchase a new microwave instead of having a service call for a circuit board that continues to be an issue  i d steer away from this one     the haier microwave was exactly as discribed and installed easily  it replaced a 10yo hotpoint over the counter which began the fail and finally threw electrial flashes and died  as a low cost replacement  the haier was the best i could find  i ve had this microwave for a year now  and it has performed flawlessly  it also looks great  and is very easy to clean  inside and out  the best thing is the one touch start for things like tea and re heating  i don t feel like i have to program a computer just to make something to eat  good quality product   installed well and works great   some reviewers commented on the way the door closes  but i have found it to be just fine   hopefully it will last a long time   i would recommend   3 2013 update   the microwave has worked flawlessly for the past year   very pleased with it   with lots of use and much by teenagers  it has shown to be sturdy and solidly built thus far   it also cooks very efficiently   still happy and would still recommend  this is a great microwave  it works great and it looks beautiful  i actually purchased mine online from walmart  but i order from amazon alot and wanted to put my review here for all of you  i ve had mine almost 2 months now  it has a 3 prong grounding plug  it s 900 watts and heats things up a lot faster than my other microwave  so i m still getting use to that  i m going to try and address everything i see people asking questions about  first off  when you hit a number  for example 2  it will automatically start cooking 2 minutes  you can press the start button and add 30 seconds  if you want a specific time  for example 3 minutes and 45 seconds  you can press the power button  then the numbers  3 4  and 5   it will start cooking 3 min  45 secs  it has a lot of buttons for specific items like popcorn  pizza  dinner plate  defrost  etc  it has a normal hum when running  it has a turntable  the clock is displayed in green  it beeps 5 times  not super loud but loud enough  then stops  the light comes on when you open the door and while cooking  it has an easy to use child safety lock to lock the door  i ve not had any problems with fingerprints on the exterior the handle pulls easily  it has a nice weight to it  i have mine on a cabinet with grip bottom shelving paper under it  so i don t know if it would slide on a smooth surface or not  mine doesn t   the inside dimensions are 12 in  wide  12 in  deep  and 8 in  high  the turntable plate is 10 1 2 in   plenty of room for most things you microwave  for the outside dimensions  the width  side to side  is 19 in   the height is 11 1 2 in  the outside dimensions given for depth includes the slight protrusion in back and the handle  the actual microwave is 13 in deep without the handle and protrusion in the back  here s the best way to let you know the depth to know if it will fit on your shelf or wherever else you put it  i have my microwave sitting on a cabinet which is 1 in  from the wall  i have it sitting 1 1 2 in  from the back of the cabinet  the actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet  there are vents in the back  and on the side opposite the handle left side if you re facing the microwave  plus the protrusion  so it needs some space  this means i have it 2 1 2 in  total from the wall  it comes out 15 in  from the back of my cabinet  the front legs sit back 2 1 2 in   which means that it is 12 1 2 in  from the back of my cabinet to the front legs  so  if your shelf is 12 1 2 in  deep  the legs would all fit on the shelf with the protrusion being 1 in  from the back of your shelf  i have the extra inch from the back of the cabinet to the wall  so if you don t  you might need your shelf to be at least 13 to 13 1 2 in  deep to give you more vent space  i think this covers everything  i think you ll be satisfied if you purchase this microwave from the back of the cabinet  the actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet  there are vents in the back  and on the side opposite the handle left side if you re facing the microwave  plus the protrusion  so it needs some space  this means i have it 2 1 2 in  total from the wall  it comes out 15 in  from the back of my cabinet  the front legs sit back 2 1 2 in   which means that it is 12 1 2 in  from the back of my cabinet to the front legs  so  if your shelf is 12 1 2 in  deep  the legs would all fit on the shelf with the protrusion being 1 in  from the back of your shelf  i have the extra inch from the back of the cabinet to the wall  so if you don t  you might need your shelf to be at least 13 to 13 1 2 in  deep to give you more vent space  i think this covers everything  i think you ll be satisfied if you purchase this microwave  this item works great  was pretty easy to install and matches our kitchen  exactly what it says in the description  arrived on time  we have no complaints whatsoever with this item  i would definitely recommend it  i looked everywhere for this microwave   i had the same one a few years ago and wanted the same one in white because i wanted  to match it with my new kitchen   it is not too big nor too small   it was the perfect depth for my shelf in my kitchen   reliable appliance  i purchased this microwave to match other frigidaire appliances i have  with price in mind  i missed that you don t have the ability to turn off the turntable on this model  it seems like that should be standard anymore  if you are cooking in something too large to make the rotation  the turntable function can be damaged  i m not used to having to push a cook time button before selecting the time  i ll get used to that  though  it gives three long beeps when the time is up  which is kind of annoying to me for some reason  even when you open the door  the beeps continue  i haven t used it much yet  i tried the popcorn feature  and it needed at least another minute of cooking time beyond what that is preset for  i like that you can add 30 seconds with the touch of a button  but if i d had more time  home construction  it arrived and was installed right away  and had purchased it locally where it would be easy to return  i would have returned it and opted for a different model  it looks nice  and i m sure it will be fine  this looks good and does what it is designed to do  my main niggle about this is that it is rather noisy  but as i only really use it for short periods anyway no more than 4 minutes at a time it is no big deal  after reading the specs  my husband measured the height before installing  we replaced the cabinet over the stove to a shorter cabinet  we were remodelling the kitchen   so we have none of the problems with the heat on the latching mechanism other people mentioned   i love all of the features on this microwave  especially the sensor cooking   it was easy to install  and after 8 years my only complaint is that the led readout has completely burned out  so my cooking is now by braile   i was checking amazon to see how much money to replace this microwave and was really surprised by the reviews   i will purchase this product again when it finally quits working  microwave mco165uw  over heats and turns off   first week had repairman out  ordered parts  after 3 weeks magic chef still had not sent parts  sent them 2 day   repairman came back out and replaced parts   still overheated   magic chef said heat water if it does not turn off it works like it is suppose to   cannot steam vegetables  cook baked potatoes and so forth   who buys a microwave just to heat water   do yourself a favor and never buy magic chef  i have had no problem with the microwave    everything has worked well since i bought the house 6 years ago  when the microwave was already 2 years old  the paint just now started to peel on the inside roof of the microwave  and since i am told that is problematic for paint chips in the food and for interfering with the magnetron  i need to replace the unit  i have the same problem as others who have posted reviews    my kitchen has custom cabinets with a space for this size unit  i could remove my stove hood and fit an over the stove microwave fan unit  but that would leave a hole where the current unit is located  and i would need to buy a custom cabinet for the hole  seems like a lot of cost to just replace a microwave  has anyone found another similarly sized unit  or had ge fixed the obvious paint defect that is an obvious problem with this model  wow  wow  wow  i was somewhat concerned about purchasing a microwave over the internet  but how great it was  i was even more than satisfied with the product it looks wonderful and works great as well  the price was less than the one we saw in the store and the delivery time was faster than what the computer stated  i had it install the same day and i am very happy about this product and the overall purchase  i know you will too  dont buy frigidaire  i bought a set of appliances  this being one of them  and the only one i havent had issues with is the stove so far  haven t even had the stuff a full year  the first time i used it  i was disappointed with it  but i don t know if it just got better  or if i pushed the wrong button the first time because it s been great since  nice and roomy interior  easy to install  i did it completely by myself  though i recommend you have a friend   i did forget to change the fan so that it vented up at first  so i had to take it down to do that  but once you get the frame mounted on the wall  that part is easy  the hardest part was mounting it to the cabinet above    i m not sure how they could have made it any easier though  the problem is mostly a matter of physics     i would recommend this to anyone needing a decent power microwave to go over their range  this general electric microwave works fine as far as cooking things or heating up water  but my menu display has never worked  i can see the menu on the machine  but what the microwave is actually doing does not show up  it is a low powered microwave  so it takes a while to cook with it  i use it daily for cooking food and heating up water for tea or soup      underneath the rotating plate rusted as water from boiling water dripped down onto the inside of the microwave  so the plastic or polymer covering came off the bottom  but it works fine still spins around as it works  the light comes on when i open the door more than a year and a half later since i got it  it does not take up much space  after 1 year of light use  maybe 3x per week to warm leftovers   the sensor stopped working and now the microwave does not heat anything   the cost to repair is more than the appliance is worth  like and earlier reviewer i was looking for a replacement for a 5 year old cabinet installed jem31 but could not find information about its compatibility   i can t comment about the reliability but it s a drop in replacement   i used all the same hardware including the faceplate from the old microwave   as a bonus the unit seems a little more advanced also   this unit is installed in a 12 inch cabinet which is a rare installation and i m grateful it s still available  i purchased this microwave in october 2008  2 years and 10 months ago  after a disastrous experience with a ge spacemaker   if i could give half stars  i would give the lg a 4 5 at this point  it was very reasonably priced compared to others with similar features  and reasonably easy to install   it does a good job overall  has some features that the spacemaker did not have  but also lacks some nice features that the  much more expensive  spacemaker had     here s what i really like about the lg   1  multiple speed exhaust fan with timer   2  more time less time buttons   3  soften melt defrost settings work well   4  turntable on off setting is useful for large or oblong cooking vessels   5  popcorn  hot dog settings are very accurate   6  hold warm feature keeps cooked items at a safe temp for up to 90 minutes   7  it doesn t need the clock set just to use the microwave   like the spacemaker did    8  it works reliably every time i use it     here s what i feel the lg lacks   1  doesn t remind you after cooking is finished  the spacemaker beeped discreetly every 30 seconds for up to an hour    2  reheat settings are sometimes a bit too aggressive   3  can t adjust the volume of the beeps when setting or finishing cooking  default volume is a bit loud    4  aesthetically  the black window on the front is not as attractive as the spacemaker s white window   5  although the ez on button starts and adds 30 second increments  a quick minute button would be useful   6  the turntable is smaller than it could be  although this has not really presented any problems    7  the spacemaker had an automatic nightlight feature  the lg does not  this is a small inconvenience      at this point in its lifetime  i would recommend this microwave   if that changes  i ll update this review accordingly  the ge profile countertop microwave 2 2 cu ft  is not only a sleek looking appliance on our counter but is easy to use and allows for large capacity food items   very satisfied with our purchase  this microwave came with our new home  it can be vented outside or inside  ours is vented inside and there is always grime on cupboards above our range where the outlet is  and we really don t fry that much  so plan to vent this outside or do a lot of scrubbing  the fan is very loud  so if you like to have a conversation anywhere in the house while cooking  this may not be the product for you  again  this might be better if vented outside  microwave itself works good  defrost function is handy  i knew this microwave had poor reviews even before i purchased it  but it was literally the only microwave i could find that would fit properly in an upper cabinet and not stick out   so on that score  it does really well   this really is a great looking microwave that fits in an upper cabinet and looks custom   unfortunately  one month after i purchased it  the trim on the right side of the microwave around the door button started falling off   and it was easy to see why as it was attached only with two sided tape   i called up mabe canada customer support and after describing the problem and faxing in my receipt  they shipped a replacement microwave straight to my door within 3 business days   i wish there was an alternative to this microwave  but i m stuck with it for now  and i have to admit the customer service was fantastic   hopefully my replacement will hold up  my 1st unit fried and was unuasable  it was replaced after a few customer service calls and a service tech visit  the replacement unit makes a big noise and the vent fan is so loud that the entire sub division could hear our microwave  i have gone through several calls to their customer service and two service visits later the issue is still not fixed  do not buy this unit  it wasn t my choice  i got it from the new home i purchased and i am sure it s not going to last even 3 months  danby model dmw111kbldb will heat for less than a minute then shows an error code and stops   bottom of right side gets very hot   brand new  returning it for sure   perhaps another brand will do better      danby promotes themselves as one of the largest household appliance marketing companies in north america   aren t they the manufacturer of this product  what i like about the whirlpool kitchen aid microwaves is they offer models with accuwave cooking   when you cook at 50  power  it cooks at 50  power rather than cycling on and off at 100  power  for 50  of the time   this makes a massive difference on how things cook   we previously had a gh5184xps with accuwave that lasted 4 years before it stopped cooking   it was starting to not look so nice from normal use  so i decided to go with a new one instead of repairing the old one       after the new microwave was installed  i tried a cup of water in it   when i started it  it sounded like an arc welder  and when i looked at the plastic panel on the right side where the magnetron is  it looked like an arc torch flame   i quickly turned it off so it wouldn t burn the place down   they took it back and gave me another   the very night we got it  we were making popcorn in the special microwave popcorn bowl  which we had used for years with our other microwaves   within a minute  we got an f7   call for service code   they offered to exchange it for a new one  but didn t have another  but told me they could sell me the new 5184  and updated model of our old one   i noticed that the new one had a broiler  slightly different menus   50 cheaper  and we had good luck with our previous 5184   however  after it was installed  the cook said  this doesn t cook right   i checked it out   the updated 5184 no longer has accuwave   that isn t how it was represented  so i gave them their  50 back and had them order another one of these from the factory   that went along for 3 days before we noticed that part way through the cooking time  the magnetron noise would stop  the fan speed up  the light got brighter  and the food stopped cooking   since the chicken was still pink  i added 2 minutes at full power  and immediately received an f7 code   the problem actually started when it stopped cooking during the previous operation   you don t get the f7 until you try to start it again and the magnetron doesn t start   we couldn t trust it with chicken   we avoided certain foods and alternated between manual and automatic cycles to get around the f7 codes   as time progressed  we could do less and less   now  you can t even trust it to finish a bowl of oatmeal       that was enough for me   there is no possibility of buying a good one from the factory  so there is no point in getting another new one   thus  i decided i would use warranty service to see if they can put in good parts that will work   the dealer recommended warranty repair source wouldn t take the job when he learned which model it was   whirlpool got another company to come the following morning   they put a large bowl of water in the microwave to test it  and could find nothing wrong   they said their manual doesn t even list an f7 code   there is nothing easier on a microwave than a large bowl of water   i went on the internet and printed off one of a myriad of postings about f7 for this microwave model  with detail instructions on how to troubleshoot   then i put real food in the microwave and showed them how easy it is to get an f7   included in the troubleshooting instructions were comments from the techs that service these every day who state that they always go through the procedure to eliminate any other causes  but it always ends up being the expensive microprocessor board   the on site techs did not follow the checklist  and called the factory   the factory told them they will send them a switch to try    i was hoping it would be the thermal switch  but the techs indicated it was not    the on site techs reminded the factory that the problem starts mid cycle   the factory came back with  as it gets hotter  the switch contacts may be increasing resistance  causing the problem   i could repeat the f7 at will   they did not check the switch for high resistance nor follow the factory procedure to troubleshoot the f7 error   next wednesday  the switch is scheduled to be delivered  and the techs will be returning to put it in   the service company also had little confidence in the factory s recommendation  but they have to do what the factory says   perhaps the fist service company has gone through this before and may be why they wouldn t take the job for this model       i ve been through 3 of this model  and 4 installs  since april 5 2011  and i don t have a good microwave yet   they ve eaten up more of my time than the microwave is worth   now it s my turn   i will make it my personal mission to require them to keep sending technicians to my house to fix this model until it works as advertised  on real food  or supply me with a model of equal to or greater value  that works as advertised  for free  and with a new warranty    videoid mo1lohj4vrrgajt  the good  my brand new  out of the box spacesaver is great looking  it is cabinet depth so it doesn t stick out  it fits perfectly under a cabinet  with the kit  and  when you can get the door open  it works really well    i just completely redid my kitchen and it looks marvelous       the bad   the door doesn t open    seriously doesn t open  ok  i m exaggerating   if you really  really try  you can eventually get the door open    from day one it didn t open   see the video demo of my trying to open the door       the better   my wonderful local appliance dealer who sold it to me is not going to try to fix it   they are sending me a new one and taking this one back  there are some benefits to paying a bit more and buying local         i ll update this review when i get the new one     i m really hoping i get a good one like a subset of the microwaves all of you have     however  you should not have to wish to be a subset when you are paying over  250 for a microwave   they should all be good  quality microwaves   there are so few under cabinet  cabinet depth  models available  we are sort of stuck with the ge spacesaver                             july 23  2011    update to my review on this microwave    my appliance dealer send me a new one and it works just fine    i ve only had it about a month  so i don t know how it will last  but as of right now  it is functioning perfectly  this machine s finish quality was off out of the box   the door didn t quite line up with it s case when closed and there were a couple small dents on the lower left of the door as well     these were tolerable  however  as long as the machine worked   and it did    sometimes     for example  from the start this machine would occasionally shut off mid cooking  as in the timer would go blank  the light would go out  and the food would still be pretty cold       other times the food would seem to be heating up pretty well but then the machine would shut off   on those occasions we thought it might have quit because it was getting too much steam on its sensors  wherever they might have been  so we would wrap foods extremely tightly with plastic wrap   still to no avail       on still other occasions the food   looked   like it was being cooked  light stayed on  the table rotated  the timer counted down  and tone sounded at the end  but then it would turn out to be only ever so slightly warmer than when originally put in     after a year of our just making do with this machine s cranky behavior and then just planning our meals without microwave use it died altogether     my wife and i can only say  good riddance  in response     consumer reports lists this microwave as a best buy and  honestly  that s why i bought it in the first place   unfortunately  this machine is far  far  far from being a good buy much less a best buy     based on my experience and those of the others who wrote in here i won t be touching a ge microwave for years  if then  great product   fits perfectly in the space we have for it and works like a charm   sleek and effective  the microwave looks good  but stopped heating after 2 months   i am on hold now with sharp customer service  the space saving design is nice  but don t like waiting for the drawer to open close  the controls being 4  off the ground are tempting for my 3yr old  this microwave is incredible   very quiet and the convenience of a drawer is great   easy to use and to clean  my sharp drawer microwave is so much more than i even hoped for   it is convenient   the button to open and button to close or easy pull to open or easy nudge to close and it finishes opening or closing by itself   love that   i had to reprogram myself to go easy to get it opening or closing  then let it finish all by itself   i was impatient because it takes 2 seconds rather than 1 2 second that i used on my previous microwave to jerk it open or slam it shut   it s good for me to slow down for 2 seconds   there are more single cook options than i have used yet  i really like the push start once to get one minute cook time  2 pushes for 2 minutes  etc   can do the same to add a minute while cooking   sensor reheat and sensor cook buttons are useful  but as in prior microwaves  i have to still keep a check on how it s cooking   it seems to cook evenly  but i probably will get a windup turntable if i can still find one     it holds a 9x13 pan with room to spare   the 1000w power cooks fast   love it   love it   love it  i wanted a microwave that took up as little counter space as possible  had sensor cooking and was easy to use   this one fit all that criteria and had a bonus   a beverage key which i use a lot to heat water to the perfect temp for tea   this microwave is perfect for my needs and i m very happy with it   the only downside is that the quality is only average  the box was somehow very light  and right then  i knew we had made a mistake       this microwave is almost like a toy   it is very tiny and underpowered   we unpacked it and put in a pack of popcorn  well  it spun around on top strength for over two minutes without a single pop   after 3 4 minutes about half of the popcorn was popped   forget it  it must have been broken  or maybe just for making things warm  not hot     we returned it right away  speedy return system  the incessant beeping is enough to make you want to put your own head inside the microwave  next to that  when you select a defrost time  it literally stops every 30 seconds to tell you to turn it over  and wont start ubnless you open and close the door then push start again i hate this thing  good thing it looks nice because the features  the beeping  and the ui is absolutely unnerving  i am writing this as some steaks are defrosting in it and the constant stops and beeping has just finally gotten me to the point where i had to come here and whine about it  this unit is a replacement for an identical item that arrived with concealed damage   i notifed amazon around 3pm the day it arrived and received word that a replacement unit had been ordered and it would take several days to process the order   two hours later  i received notification that the replacement unit had been shipped   it arrived at 9 15 the next morning   outstanding customer service effort by amazon     this microwave replaced a 2002 sharp model identical in size  power and other features   the first thing i noticed is that it takes 30  to 40  longer to heat compared to the older model  even after 8 years of use   this is across the board  not just on certain items   also  the keypad has been reconfigured with the start and stop buttons situated in between rows of other buttons instead of separated from other buttons as on the older model   the buttons are also smaller and it is easy to push the wrong button if you get in a hurry   i will say it is a more attractive unit and a lot quieter than the older model  i bought this because i don t have a double oven in my kitchen and this can serve that purpose   if you have a double oven  then i think you are better off with a standard high quality microwave     this is a high speed microwave convection oven  but due to the size of the cavity the conv oven takes longer to heat up   about 10 minutes to reach 350  once preheated convection works good       does a nice job with frozen pizza  rib roast  chicken  etc  this makes really good toast in 6 minutes  3 minutes per side  you have to flip the bread  but i don t think it saves any time   also  when you use the convection oven  remember it has to cool down to use it again as a microwave  that can take another 10 15 minutes     bought mine about 4 yrs ago with a 5yr extended warranty  within the last month  a piece of plastic trim fell off  door handle cracked  and the touch screen started randomly simulating keypresses     repair service came out 3x to get the right parts ordered and repaired  maybe it s fixed   will find out     cooks well   the best feature is that this is a variable microwave  unlike most units that simply turn the magnetron on and off to vary the power    this one actually reduces the power itself    very cool   this also combines microwave with convection bake and grill capabilities  and you can control the bake temp as well as the   of microwave to use  for grilling you control the microwave   but not the grill temp  as the grill halogen just stays on the whole time   that isactually a very nice feature   on my regular oven  the broiler turns off at 500     so from that standpoint the unit is pretty smart     get this on a firesale if you can    get a long term 5yr   extended warranty  you will use it     as other s point out  it doesn t have program cooking  can t do a delayed start  can t do multiple programs in sequence  doesn t have a meat thermometer  but it does have a lot of pre sets   so  it s an ok unit  i haven t really found anything that competes with it   would be interested in hearing feedback on better choices  as a vertically challenged individual  i was looking forward to getting a countertop microwave when we remodelled our kitchen   however  i was not looking forward to giving up the multiple functions offered by my larger  over the stove microwave   additionally  i did not want to give up my useable counter space which i would have to do with the standard 18 inch or more deep countertop microwaves   i also wanted enough space left on the counter so that  if necessary  when removing something from the microwave  i could sit the container on the counter immediately in front of the microwave   i had a small 24 inch wide by 14 inch deep nook available between my refrigerator and the corner appliance garage  but was certain i would not find a suitable microwave to fit   since we were not replacing cabinets  i had to work with the available spaces  br    br   to my surprise  the ge profile spacemaker ii was the exact size of the nook   although there were many negative reviews of the product  i decided to take a chance on this microwave and purchased one at best buy   through an abundance of caution  i also purchased an additional 4 year warranty so that if i experience any of the problems others have encountered  i will be able to have the spacemaker ii repaired or replaced   as the extended warranty was only a little more than a service call would cost  i felt it was worth the expenditure  br    br   so far  i am very pleased with the ge profile spacemaker ii microwave   my spouse and i do not cook meals in our microwave  but do reheat beverages  cook frozen vegetables and veggie burgers  and  occasionally  defrost meat   the spacemaker performs these functions admirably   although it takes about 30  more time to heat cook things than my 1100 watt microwave  this has not been a problem   further  i like this model better for defrosting as it does not start cooking the meat like the more powerful models do   the control panel buttons are very responsive   i have cracked other microwave s button surfaces because of the difficulty in getting them to respond to my touch   i do not foresee this occuring with the spacemaker ii  br    br   in the past  i have allowed bread to raise inside my microwave   i found this allowed me to leave the bowl or pan uncovered as there is no air flow inside the microwave  and the temperature remains consistent   the spacemaker s interior is large enough for me to continue using the microwave in which to raise bread  br    br   because i keep this microwave on my counter  i keep a plastic glass of water in it to prevent accidentally starting it empty and possibly ruining the magnatron  br    br   further  i would caution those who are looking for a compact microwave for an elderly individual who may be confused by having to choose among multiple function buttons   the ge profile spacemaker ii has a control panel that can be confusing as it has 29 separate buttons from which to choose   thus  it might not be the best choice for individuals  br    br   for me  the ge profile spacemaker ii is the ideal microwave and i am giving it a five star rating   if things change  i will update my review accordingly s button surfaces

ii is the ideal microwave and i am giving it a five star rating   if things change  i will update my review accordingly  this microwave was great while it worked  but it didn t work near long enough   i expect more from a product at this price point  especially one that consumer reports rated very highly  unfortunately i ve owned this microwave for approximately 18 months  only to a have the magnatron  apparently the part that makes it heat  go out   i ve contacted whirpool on 3 occasions and have not been very happy with my results   first they agreed to pay for the labor and not the part  then they agreed to pay for the part and not the labor   the part is back ordered so i m stuck with no microwave and paying for something that  judging by the number of other complaints on here  is obviously a manufacturing a error  i would advise staying far away from this product and this company  after our old microwave died we started searching the market online and in stores   i purchased consumer reports for microwaves and then searched for them on amazon to read the customer reviews   the top ten rated had horrible customer reviews   so then decided to search from the bottom of the list up  and this is when i found our next microwave   loud was the only beef with this microwave   now in our house loud with all our kids is nothing compared to a microwave   basically if your trying to sleep near by this microwave then maybe it would seem loud   but the 1200 watts cooks everything super fast  even heat with the turning tray is awesome   this is used several times a day and after a month no complaints  my husband   i were looking for a microwave for my daughter   her husband for a christmas gift   this is the same brand that we have   are very happy w  it   this is exactly what we were looking for   so happy to find it   such a reasonable price   their home is nearing completion   they are so excited to install this microwave   start using it   our daughter said that she just loves the modern look   knows that it ll look wonderful w  all their other stainless steal appliances  we replaced our 15 year old ge profile spacemaker with a new updated geprofile spacemaker microwave oven   it is basically the same one with big subtle improvements   i am probably the only one who used the old microwave with all of  its bells and whistles   i am amazed at how updated these items are today    forinstance to cook fresh vegetables just load them in and push the veggie button   somehow it senses when they are cooked to perfection and not rubber   i cooked a  perfect scrambeled egg in one minute  stirring once       we oredered the undermount hardware just because   guess what   since we replaced  the identical microwave the old mount fit perfectly  oh well     i really would have loved it in stainless steel but didn t see it offered     i do hope this gives us another 15 years but at that price i am not too worried  about the track record  the first ge over the stove microwave i bought 30 years  ago was  600  we ve owner this product for several years now   it looks nice and works great   amazon handles the shipping of this heavy product with ease so you don t need  to be concerned about it getting to you in top condition  as good or better than i hoped  lots of options  fan is great  it is noisier than my old one  as per other reviews  but really   it doesn t matter that much  we also experienced problems with the paint peeling in this microwave   it is no longer under warrenty and i was told by ge that this was an isolated incident   obviously  that is not the case   i would not recommend this product especially since ge is unwilling to stand behind their product  we have had this microwave for about a month and absolutely love it   well worth the price   it is super convenient  you can see and stir the food without removing it from the oven   cooks evenly and quickly   easy to use and clean  very attractive  a conversation piece as well  after owning a previous sharp microwave convection oven i bought this one   installed 5 years ago and still just as pleased as the day it was installed   excellent even microwave and oven performance   highly recommend this product  the installation dimensions in the install guide are exactly right   i worried about trusting them  but they worked very well     looks real nice  works well  and was very easy to install     one issue  when the drawer closed  it made a squeeking sound   i figured it was going back into the box and getting shipped back   we called sharp and they sent out a technician who diagnosed the problem and ordered a replacement part   we ll have to update if things go south with that  but so far  i appreciated the customer service     four stars because of the squeaking drawer  but not one star because the customer service was so good  microwave is very spacious  works well and is very powerful     we love this unit   arrived with faulty circuit card  would not heat up   sharp warranty personnel were here within 2 days and fixed it  i bought the 1 6 cu ft white one of these  my older and twice as expensive whirlpool died and i didn t want to spend another 500 bucks on something that i now realize is a disposable item  when these break  almost any repair will cost as much as a new unit so i decided to stop buying top tier on these ovens  this unit was easy to install  it s lighter than my whirlpool was  so i was able to hoist it onto the mounting plate myself and start the top screws without a problem  i think perhaps those who are complaining about the weight bought the larger model  who knows  sometimes it s hard to tell what some folks bought in these amazon reviews  br    br   as others report  the fan is really loud  wow  and low fan is just as loud  the fan is definitely the down side  i found that the light is bright enough  cooking is fast  the control panel is very spartan  oh  it has all the buttons  but where my old microwave said pizza and casserole etc  in the display  this one just has a numeral and you ll have to refer to the book a bit until you get the hang of it  most of my cooking is just hitting the quick button anyway  so let s be real  i m glad it doesn t have a lot of features i ll seldom use and that i would have had to pay for  the door looks solid enough to me  i see no problem with keeping it clean that others have reported  but perhaps that s because mine is white  so it s a good basic microwave  as cheap as they come and it works just fine  i consider it a 5 star cheap microwave  br    br   edit added  br   well  it has stopped working properly after 6 months  most annoying is that the interior light will not turn off even though the door switches are working properly  while i liked the spartan controls  my wife learned to detest that feature  i ve decided not to have it repaired under warranty  but to be rid of it and buy a unit with better build quality  i m dropping it down to 3 stars  it will probably be discontinued soon anyway but hate to leave my former rave review in place without changing it without changing it  i purchased a ge profile spacemaker 2 0 oven model  jvm2070 bho2 in 2007  about a year later the handle came off in my hand  i did my own repair but in so doing found the quality of construction to be quite poor  self threaded screws in inferior quality plastic was the problem  now  the keypad will not accept any inputs  ge only sells a control assembly at nearly  400  the oven originally cost about  500   ge says their ovens are not consumer repairable and refer customers to a repair facility  my options are to pay a ge technician  75 00 to tell me the control assembly must be replaced at a cost of  400 or buy another brand of oven with a longer service life  which option do you think i will choose  too many problems for a high end microwave  after 1 year of use  the handle broke  the convection piece of it will not work  stay away from this product  excellent price and product  2 day shipping with amazon prime   another really good investment    this has turned out to be a very good buy as a replacement for a sears kenmore over the range microwave   which was useless from day one  it fits well  very secure mounts and easy to use template  oven itself is easy to use  quiet  powerful  excellent venting  in our case out the top   to the roof   everything has been easy to clean so far  including the buttons and window   i put it in myself   but two person job would have been a better choice  really like the sensor cooking  so i don t have to figure out how long it will take to burn the rice this time      definitely recommend this oven  please read the reviews  it could save you time  money and frustration   i also bought a ge microwave   cafe thought it would be a quality product because i paid over  400 00  it also started dying after the first year  the magnatron  which has a five year warrenty was corroded and had to be replaced at an additional    repair cost  part was free   one day after the 30 day repair warrenty the microwave  totally died   800     repair failed to come during appointed time  in fairness they later said they had called and rescheduled  but i had no message on my phone so i waited for 4 hours   the manager i spoke to was willing to have me wait another five hours on another day  that s the best they could do   so if you want to throw your money away and get poor service  definitely buy ge products  this is awesome  love it  it was easy to install  cooking and defrosting is very well  and the shipping was early  very happy overall  i like the look and functionality of this microwave and it is at a good price compared to others  my only negative feedback is that i feel it is a little loud when turned on  my husband thinks i only hate this because i don t like loud noises  and it doesn t heat things as fast as our old microwave  for this one  if the recommended cooking time is 3 5 minutes i will have to put it in for about 3 30  where on our old one i could put it in for 2 45      overall  though  it is a good product at a good price and has good functionality  we bought one of these in october 09  it took three vists from a whirlpool repair service before they could get the convection part to work  we weren t able to use the convection portion until late december 09  now that it works  it is extremely noisy  both during cooking and during cool down  yes  cool down  when you are finihed cooking it goes into a cool down mode for about another 15 minutes and is just as noisy  i admit that the micro wave works great and it has many features we like  my advice is to buy a microwave and a good broiler oven  if you are like us and do mostly cooking for two  beware  i bought this over the range microwave in march of 2009  and it stopped working completely yesterday  feb 25 2010   i use it once or twice per day  normal stuff like tv dinners  it looks very nice  but it was not built to last   i bought it online and i m hunting through my archived e mails trying to find my receipt so that i can get it serviced  preferably replaced   earliest appointment is in a week  so i am without a microwave for at least a week  this microwave has more features than any other on the market   and aesthetically it is a work of art   when it works  it is fabulous  unfortunately that just isn t often enough   we had this microwave for   3  years and if we were lucky  we got 2  years of use our of it   sadly  the sophistication of this appliance seems to be its achilles heel   there are so many feature to break and they do     i could accept the fact that our unit was a lemon  however this was the second unit i purchased   the first died in two days and it was decided that the retailer would just take it back   also  a good friend of ours purchased the same model and has had numerous issues of their own   with their door components  lcd panel  etc  replaced multiple times     we love the microwave  but just can t handle the constant breakdowns and huge delays in repair   typically down for a month due to delays in service calls  all parts having to be ordered  then waiting for tech to come back   and in many cases  waiting for them to order more parts  when the unit is down  not only don t you have a microwave  you don t have an exhaust fan  so there s an impact to all of your cooking     below is a recap  of the items i could remember  of our whirlpool adventure     microwave purchased   9 7 07

instructions left something to be desired  but we figured it out    asin b002x7669c ge jes0736spss stainless steel countertop microwave oven   quick review  totally satisfied after 8 months of moderate use  excellent value     my wife and i looked at every small   1 cubic ft  microwave at all prices before choosing this one  we have a very small kitchen in our condo and counter space is at a premium  we ve had this unit for 8 months and it has performed flawlessly with daily moderate use  we use it mostly for baked potatoes  leftovers  popcorn  defrosting  etc  so we haven t subjected it to heavy use  although it s only 700 watts  it gets the job done in a reasonable amount of time  2 medium potatoes in 9 minutes   the black stainless steel casing and classic styling appealled to us also  our dinner plates fit on the turntable with just a little room to spare     at this point  i don t think we could be more satisfied with our purchase   69 95 at lowes   especially since we considered models 3x the price  our previous microwave was a space hogging montgomery ward monster we got as a wedding present 25 years ago  thank gods it finally died  we ll see how this diminutive new ge holds up  i will update this review if we have any issues with it as time goes by  this black lg over the range microwave is just what we needed   it arrived in good condition with clear directions and fits perfectly     we re happy customers  walmart has same model for  63    9 97 shipping  i m a loyal amazon com shopper  but can t pass that up   we bought this  from amazon  in july   no issues   installed it and it worked great  for less than 4 months   the microwave stopped working 3 days before thanksgiving   called factory service  2 weeks   the appointment is scheduled for 8 12   they show up at 11 55   they stay until 2 00  yup it s broke  but we need parts and 2 people   2 more weeks  parts are shipped to our house and service calls to confirm they are here    factory service that doesn t have parts  interesting way to do business    they show up at 11 58  seriously   two hours  and another vacation day burned  and the replacement parts are defective    warm fuzzy  not    two more weeks  and they canceled their appointment   seems it takes two people to install it and the wonderful factory service only scheduled one     so the top of the line microwave with convection oven will spend christmas in the garage   my newly remodeled kitchen a gaping hole with metal mounting plate for all my guests to admire     i have e mailed whirlpool  will update if and when we get this very frustrating and disappointing mess resolved     thinking of buying this brand item  save yourself  don t       update 12 28 09   well they canceled their appointment to fix it again   they now have us waiting another 2 weeks before they can get someone to try and fix it   whirlpool customer service contacted us and said the only option we have is to get it fixed  they will not replace their defective equipment   so it is still sitting in my garage waiting for someone to show up       the great news is santa did bring me a microwave to sit on my counter just in case my hopes that the repairmen soon will be here wouldn t happen   it is a sharp   bare bones model but it works  santa is a wise man     oh  and where will my whirlpool microwave be spending new year s   the garage     february 28  after 5 more appointments  2 of which they failed to show whirlpool agreed to replace the microwave   we have the new one 3 days   i do enjoy this microwave  i have my fingers crossed it will be reliable       if you have problems  keep good records  stay with factory authorized service and be persistent  this model performed as to be expected    it adequately heated items  after just over one year it suddenly suffered a short and started starting by itself  additionally  the control pad stopped working  we temporarily overcame the problem by leaving the unit unplugged until needed and it then only sometimes functioned  perhaps the old adage is correct in you get what you pay for  we installed sharp model kb6524 in june 2009 during a kitchen remodel  every appliance in our kitchen is new and this particular appliance is my favorite due to the uniqueness and convenience of this model  this microwave has exceeded our expectations in every way  one of the reasons we bought this microwave was that we needed a microwave that would fit under the countertop so our kids could reach it  it is also nice that the door slides open and i can reach down to lift out the food instead of having to reach up at face level and lift food out and down  i liked the unique concept of a drawer that pulls open instead of a door that pops open  i was a little concerned about reviews on earlier models that the auto open and close function on this microwave has a tendency to break  however  it seems that sharp decided to manufacture this one so it closes with a button or by pushing or pulling on it to eliminate that problem  i was also concerned that it didn t have a piece in it that rotates the food  so  we were surprised to find that none of the food we have cooked has hotspots  note  i only use my microwave for reheating   not cooking   i love this microwave  i had considered purchasing the 30 but decided that it was unlikely that i would need to put a dish in the microwave that was bigger than 24  so far  this has been the perfect size  it is even tall enough that i can put my portable mug in it to heat up my tea  also  my lovely daughter did not know that you can t put metal in the microwave  she put her fork in with her plate  surprisingly  the microwave did not arch  we checked the manual and it said you can even use aluminum foil to cover portions of meat  not sure how they do it  but i m not likely to try it  the microwave seems fine after the fork episode  this microwave also has programmable features such as softening ice cream  it asks what size of ice cream then sets the time as appropriate  it s a nice feature but i m not usually softening a whole tub ofice cream  just a portion of a tub  one other feature i use frequently  pushing the power button after closing the drawer will turn on the microwave in one minute increments  as an example  pushing the button 3 times will equate to 3 minutes  this is a pricey microwave but has been well worth the expense in our experience  i highly recommend this microwave  this is the neatest microwave i have ever worked with  it does everything for you  the controls are easy to use and very easy to see  i can not say enough about the guy we purchased this from  he went above and beyond to make sure we got the microwave before we left town driving from ca  to or to meet me  i purchased this unit to replace a sharp r 2110jw smart carousel which proved to be a piece of junk  what a contrast  for about the same price this unit is much higher quality  the controls are well thought out  the door is designed with the window built in  the sharp has a plastic overlay glued on that fell off after a couple months  the wall mounting was very easy and straightforward  overall i couldn t be much happier  lg has won a convert  this sharp microwave is great for a family  its large size is a big plus   easy operation and nice finish and very powerful    we had an lg oven before and it is a junk   it lasted only 2 years   our old microwave was a sharp also and its still working after 20  years   my rating a    i have been unable to find filters that fit this microwave  i ordered some through sharp and they didn t fit   sharp told me that i would have to get a service man out to install them   the service man could not install them and he called sharp and was told that there was a design error and there were no filters available for this model   sharp would not reimburse me for the expense of the service call   otherwise  it is a great microwave convection oven  i bought this microwave to replace my previous sharp r 1449   this one is deeper  more plastic  and slightly more powerful   it seems reliable  only have had it 6 weeks   has a good vent and good stove lights   i wish it had a night light and a switch to stop turntable rotation though one can get around it by removing the turntable  my biggest disappointment was that it utilizes a different mounting plate than my previous sharp microwave     i gave it four stars b c it does the job and it was inexpensive compared to other manufacturers  incidentally  mounting instructions were very good  i ve selected this model  because it is the only convectional microwave oven that fits my kitchen  other models require some extra space in front of the microwave on the left side  to be able to open the door  it is not a problem for most kitchens  but if you have a deep cabinet to the left of the microwave that extends in front of oven  sharp seems like the only option  sharp has put a smaller door that starts about an inch from the left side of the microwave  so it opens freely     so far i was not disappointed  i m mostly using the microwave mode  convectional mode  it cooks well  and the menu is rather intiutive   what else do you need  auto reheat works well and produces consistently good results  i was not getting very good result with mixed mode  oven   microwave  though     there are some faults in this model  that i think sharp should ve done better  so it only got 4 starts   1  the menu system could be better  e g  the start button on most microwaves also serves as  add minute  or  add 30sec   but here it would not do anything   one has to use dedicated  add minute  button  i got used to it  but my guests can t easily find this button   2  the fan is very very loud  it has two speeds  but even with reduced speed  it is very loud  it does not look extremely powerful either   3  the range light is generated by two small incandescent bulbs  i would expect energy efficient fluorescent lamps or leds for this high end oven  they could ve perfectly fit a long tube there  but have instead put old unefficient incandescent bulbs   4  the interior is stainless steeel  but it is not very smooth  so it takes some effort to clean the microwave  this microwave is wonderful  the quick heat buttons are convenient and easy to use  if you read consumer reports  it says this  or similiar  microwave has only a useful space of 0 9 cubic feet  not so  this has a full 2 0 cubic feet of space which is great for cooking a ham or a large casserole dish  very sharp design  useful and adequate lighting underneath  for the installation do it yourselfers  it s 60 pounds and you have to lift it above your shoulders if you are installing over a stove  follow the instructions to the letter  and all will turn out great  the directions are very good  note  if you can  remove your stove before installing the microwave  the mfgr doesn t mention this  but it made things a lot easier  and i got to clean under it     2 3  3 preferred  people are definitely needed to install this safely due to its weight and awkward size  i recommend this microwave highly  great microwave at great price   i bought one from amazon com last month for  199   it arrived in one week   no shipping charge   looks great   works great   installed easily    professionally installed for  65    nice clean lines   easy to operate   hit the button once for one minute   hit it again for each additional minute  i bought this oven to replace a whirlpool of equal size  i like the lg  it s a little more powerful  and the moisture sensor seems to work pretty well  it s a heavy beast and you will want to use the template that comes with it to lay out the installation bracket positions and holes for the support bolts  get those right and the installation is no big deal  it does take two people to horse this 60 lb  appliance into place while starting the bolts  threading the cord etc     it took me a couple of hours from opening the box to firing it up and i was a cabinet installer in my youth  still  no big deal     tip  use a light spray adhesive to attach the layout template to the bottom of upper support cabinet  we are very pleased with the sharp microwave   it works very well   has easy to follow directions and looks great  the microwave oven arrived on time and in excellent condition   we have tested it to make sure it works   it was just installed so we haven t used it a lot yet     completely happy   excellent amazon service as usual  i love this microwave  it was worth waiting for  i had ordered this microwave from 4 other companies that said they had it in stock and then called to tell me they were backordered amazon delivered  thanks i should have listened to my wife     i m about to arrange to take my third monday afternoon in a row off from work so i can be here for ge s service technician  he s repairing my microwave  which is less than 6 weeks old      here s what happened     week 1  i call the service center  describe the problem i m having  power cuts off after a few seconds  and the rep says it s probably an inverter board  and schedules a repair call     week 2  the technician arrives  diagnoses the problem and says it s an inverter board  he orders the part     week 3 the part has arrived  the repair guy comes to install it  but it s the wrong part  he has to order the right part  i have to take a third day off from work to be available   and we have to go another week without a microwave     wouldn t the right thing for ge to have done is replace the microwave  just ship us a new one  and have us ship the old one back  or have the repair guy make the swap      that would be showing ge cares about their customer s time  they re concerned if they waste time because of their error  and keeping customers satisfied is its top priority  instead  ge parrots back the warranty  we only have to repair the appliance  not replace it  and disregards what this experience has meant to its customer and his perception of their company  i have never owned a convection oven before  i love it  living in the south and only cooking for 2 people  why heat up the whole kitchen   it s so easy to use  i bake everything in it now  i also use most of my pampered chef stones in it for even easier clean up  e  j  tastad s review of this product is accurate and appropriate  but i would like to add some additional information   i bought this ge profile microwave oven in march of 2006 on the recommendation of consumer reports   in september 2009 i am sorry to report that i had to throw it out because it wasn t worth repairing   consumer reports gave this ge model their top rating for large microwave ovens   it replaced an old amana radarrange that i had used for about 25 years before it burst into flames   the amana had also received consumer reports top rating back then   if i recall  my amana sold for about twice as much money  in 1981 dollars  as this ge costs in 2006 dollars  br    br   since this microwave oven is more powerful  faster and consumes more electricity than small models  you may need to have a dedicated 20 ampere outlet available for its use   compared with my old amana  the ge has a much more uniform distribution of heat when cooking or reheating  probably because the food is rotated on a turntable   as e  j  tastad found  the defrost cycle is easy to use  gives good distribution of heat and the front panel controls are fairly intuitive   the stainless steel cabinet is attractive and easy to clean  br    br   unlike my old amana  this oven cannot multi task   for example  if you re running the built in clock timer  you cannot cook or reheat something on a different schedule using different functions   you must stop the clock timer to begin a cook cycle and vice versa   you also cannot program several sequences of automatic operations as my old amana could accommodate  nor can you program it to start at a later time  br    br   this microwave oven was not as reliable and did not last nearly as long as my old amana did   the magnetron tube in my ge profile microwave oven failed after two years of use   it s replacement was covered by the five year ge warranty on the tube  but the warranty didn t cover the  85 in labor charges  which would have been even more if i had received the service on site instead of taking the appliance to the appliance repair depot   after 3 1 2 years of use   september 2009  the main circuit board self destructed   it cost me  44 at the nearest ge repair facility to learn that it would cost me more than another  200 to replace the microwave oven s circuit board  br    br   since other brands of similar sized and power microwave ovens cost less than the repairs  i have discarded this microwave oven after 3 1 2 years and after spending  129 in diagnostic and repair charges in addition to the purchase price   given this experience  i now be hard pressed to recommend this appliance considering its cost of ownership and short life   this appliance should have lasted much longer   it did not get heavy use and was never misused or abused  br    br   when i contacted ge about my failed microwave oven  they promised to make things right  asked for the model and serial number and requested that i cut off the appliance s power cord and plug and send it to them   they then sent me a  100 rebate check that could be applied only to another ge appliance purchase   the check expired before i found another ge appliance that i wanted to own  br    br   i bought a replacement  which was a panasonic model nn sd978s microwave oven for less than  200 from sam s club   it is just as large  cooks faster and has proven to be far more reliable   after four years  it s still going strong without need for repairs ore if i had received the service on site instead of taking

substance that it is okay to heat to boiling  don t trust it with pizza  or other foods like that   br    br   bottom line   this is an excellent large microwave for countertop use   the inverter defrost works almost perfectly every time  never cooking my food more than it should  but the reheat is a gimmick  br    br   this is a large countertop microwave  at about 2 2 cubic foot   coming from an over the range microwave this is a huge improvement in size   the microwave heats uniformly and fast  it is 1200 watts    the sensor reheat should only be used on foods it is safe to boil  otherwise it overcooks about everything else   it also works best when you lightly cover the food  as sometimes uncovered food triggers it to turn off too early   lightly covered is critical  as the sensor works off water vapor temperature being released from the product   if the water vapor cant leave the container it could become superheated   sensor cook should also only be used under supervision  you should be in the same room   br    br   i have had the microwave for about 6 months now with no issue   it is no louder than other microwaves i have used  and the controls are intuitive and easy to use   you do not have to press a cook button or anything to start your timed cooking   my favorite feature is the inverter defrost   remember you enter the weight in pounds  so for an 8 oz pack of bacon you would enter 5 and start for 1 2 of a pound   if you had a 1 5 pound package of meat  you would enter 15 and start for 1 5 pounds   the display shows the weight correctly  not much else to say about the product  it is a microwave after all  br    br   update  to improve sensor reheat performance  use a lid over the food with a vent hole   i use a paper plate with a small hole  finger tip size  punched in it   this will make sure the reheat stays running long enough  but still gets some water vapor to judge the food temperature by so it doesn t over cook  br    br   update  6 26 2010   i have been using the microwave 2 years now   it has been no issue and still works perfectly   i use the sensor reheat almost all the time for soups and casseroles  and use the inverter defrost for my frozen goods   i also use the popcorn button to heat microwave popcorn bags   everything has been working great  br    br   update  7 26 2011   still going strong   i use the inverter regularly for defrost  or lowering the power level to cook something slower   it has worked well for me  and i think problems might be from shipping  quality control  or some other factor

research  i settled on this terrific microwave   every brand of microwave seems to have a malfunction no help horror story  so in the end  if you chance having a microwave at all  this one seems better than most  if not all   it works splendidly without any problem with noise or mechanical parts  my experience with sharp carousels has been 5 stars   at home and work they have been dependable  efficient  good looking  and inexpensive   both the 2 0 and 1 4 cubic foot carousels are commodious enough for large casseroles  when i designed my kitchen twenty years ago  i made two below counter cabinet spaces to tuck in a medium and a large countertop microwave  i bought carousels and have used them simultaneously almost daily   they have been great workhorses   the smaller one lost some of the digital display to no effect a few months ago  then made nasty little arcing noises last week and promptly was sent out to pasture  last year i bought new stainless steel appliances  including bosch dual fuel slide in range   the dream machine   and so i chose the stainless steel sharp r 408ls carousel 1 4 cubic foot 1100 w with a 14 inch turntable from bj s   99  as a replacement  the match with the other appliances was so good that i replaced the 2 cubic foot 1200 w with sharp s r 520ks microwave as well  the display pads are lightly different  but better than losing size in the 1 4 cu  ft   the carousels match the bosch oven door design remarkably  including the rounded window corners   my kitchen looks better than when it was totally new with this addition  knowing that these two new appliances are untried in the long term  i can only say they are 5  stars as week old additions to my kitchen  the microwaves do everything i want powerfully and quickly  the cost  especially with amazon prime shipping  closed the deal  it looks lovely in our stainless steel kitchen  but after only 3 years of use  it has problems  now the start button doesn t work  but the microwave is on nonstop whenever the door is closed  started very suddenly  will have to get it serviced  great defrost  potato  popcorn functions  for the price i don t think you can beat this sharp microwave   i just wanted a basic microwave that did the job   i was replacing a countertop micro that was rated at 1200 watts and i was concerned that the rated 950 watts of the sharp would be inadequate   my fears were groundless as the sharp functions every bit as fast the older one   i like the sleek appearance without a protruding door handle   they recommend two people to mount this oven  however since i didn t have help available i was able to easily mount it myself with a little thought   if i were to rate it down for anything it would be that the mounting instructions are confusing in a couple of areas  mainly in the venting info   all in all a good buy  we purchased this itme for a family member for christmas  they love it  said its the best microwave they ever had  they love the one touch features as well as the large cooking area  would recommend if you want a dependable and spacious microwave  i bought the sharp r 520ks microwave to replace my old white westinghouse that stopped working after thanksgiving   i did alot of research before i bought this one   i was worried i wouldn t find a microwave that worked as well as my last one   the good thing is that i could finally replace my white microwave with stainless steel to match the appliances in my new house   now i had an excuse to replace it   i was looking for a powerful 1200 watt microwave large enough to fit large dishes in  and this one had some of the best reviews  a decent price  and the stainless steel look i wanted   i also needed a counter top model since i have no under cabinet space to put one   this microwave works great   i also like how the control panel doesn t have elevated buttons making it easy to wipe clean with no chance of food or anything getting stuck in the buttons   it has some nice features like the hot water button  you tell it how many cups to heat   minute plus button  keep warm setting  and many others   i ve probably used the hot water and minute plus features the most   there are sensor heating buttons  reheat buttons  and defrost buttons  although i haven t had a chance to use them as much yet   the ones i have used so far work great   my only minor complaint is the same as everyone else s  the buttons all look the same and the start minute plus button and stop cancel button are located in the midst of all the other buttons making it difficult to distinguish them quickly   not too much of an issue  but it would have been nice if those features were located on the bottom or the corner of the display and were different than the others   it wouldn t keep me from purchasing this microwave since everything else is great and i m sure i ll get used to them soon   the microwave is also pretty large  so you can fit alot in there   i ve heated a cup of water and a dinner sized plate of food at the same time   all in all  this microwave works great  looks great  and was reasonablypriced   i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice looking  powerful  counter top microwave  we got this through amazon and have been very pleased   i do recommend that you open the box and inspect immediately upon delivery  especially if it is during the holiday season when shippers use a lot of inexperienced people  our first unit s box externally seemed fine but the interior packing was pulverized and the unit was obviously busted up   amazon replaced it and our second unit is still running strong      i love this   i could write a tome   the convection oven not only bakes and roasts  but setting at 100 degrees  i use it for raising bread  and 150 degrees  i ll bring a steak or roast up to room temp before searing and cooking  i think at 150 degrees it s faster and safer than having it sit on the kitchen counter as recommended in my cookbooks  i m a better cook     one warning about a dual use appliance like this  which should be obvious  when you are using it for one thing it is not available for the other   i wouldn t want to be without this unit  but i also have another microwave and i feel i need both  i would say i use the two  in tandem  nearly every evening  i had a same model of microwave which worked for me about   4to 5 years very good and that was the reason i ordered the same brand and model again    the new one so far has been very good too but the one way blocking door over the exhaust fan was noisy which i swapped it with the  older one and fixed the problem overall is very good and i like it  this was a great buy   i read the other reviews and they are right on the money  easy to put up but it goes easer with two people but one can do it and everything you need is their and it works great  after one year the turntable plate cracked while we were making a bag of popcorn   very strange indeed   now trying to find a replacement as i really miss the food items turning while cooking   other than that it is still working in top notch condition  br    br   update   this microwave died after only 2 years  was hoping to get more out of it then we did  i never got to use this microwave oven because the door would not stay shut   i had to send it back   darn   amazon was very helpful and took care of my problem   i am pleased with amazon s service  earlier sharp microwaves have been great  but this model beats the others we ve had in features and speed  and this newer model cost a lot less  we haven t yet used all the features this microwave affords  but  we know we re going to be saving a lot of cooking time great help in the installation  smaller oven size than ge or sears  display could have larger numbers  no handle to open door  this oven is great  it ll cook anything and fast too  it s a little pricey but you get what you pay for most of the time  this time i did  stick a hot dog  or some potaoes or bacon in there and push the right number and presto you have cooked food  we had baked chicken the other night and it was brown  done and tasty  i love the darn thing  i give it a high five  love it  love it  love it   my sharp microwave of 10 years finally died   it had survived numerous moves and the door was actually held on by strapping tape   we looked around at other microwaves and found we couldn t beat the price for all the features offered by this model from   this one was built with the same quality as my old one and i don t doubt it will last as long  my sharp convection  over the range mirowave is perfect  other brands have a protruding handle   could hit tall people in the face  the handle on my new sharp is flush and much more stylish  my husband installed it  the instructions were great  sharp has designed the shipping box to be used as a lifter and holder to assist the installer    br   the best thing was the excellant service from amazon  and i saved over  200  thank you amazon and sharp     this microwave works pretty good   the sensor cook is awesome and will reheat or cook items almost perfectly   the only bad thing i ve seen is that it s got a rather large footprint  we really like this microwave but more we like how easy it was to get it from amazon   it really has a good convection oven  although is somewhat noisy with the fan   it was very easy to install and came with very clear instructions   amazon delivered it quickly and it was the best price as anywhere  this is a great microwave  especially with the  25 discount amazon is offering on kitchen purchases over  125  but let me tell you why this purchase was extra special  i was concerned about buying a microwave that had to be delivered  size  weight  fragile  etc  rather than from a local store    but the selection at local stores like best buy was so bad  i placed the order  unfortunately  the day it was supposedly delivered by ups  no microwave arrived  i called ups to see if i could start a tracer  but ups told me that amazon had to start the tracer because they sent the package  i went to the customer service site  couldn t find a phone number  and used the e mail system  i thought   great   that e mail will disappear into the ether  i may never hear from anybody  and here i am without my microwave   that was about 8pm local time when i sent the e mail   br     br   the next morning when i checked my e mail  i got quite a surprise  an amazon rep wrote back  apologized my package had been lost  and re ordered the item for me  before too long  i had an e mail the item was already shipping via 2 day delivery  and sure enough  2 days later i had the replacement package  wow  no hassle  no waiting  just great service  i couldn t believe it  i don t think i ll ever hesitate when i want to order something from amazon again  i don t work for amazon  they re not paying for this   i ve actually never written a product review before  i was just so impressed with the customer service  i had to write   br     br   the final chapter   the day before the replacement microwave arrived  the person who lives in the next cul de sac over from us  with the same house number  and with a street name similar to ours  showed up with the original microwave that ups had mistakenly delivered to them  i wrote amazon customer service an e mail  and once again after a very quick response  i was able to arrange for ups to come pick up the extra package   thanks amazon   you re great  i love it   the only problem is the popcorn button is not set long enough to complete popping the popcorn   it is only half cooked   the convection works great and much simpler than my previous combination convection microwave oven doesn t have all the bells and whistles as my last sharp over the range microwave  but it works for me   turntable has no on off button  so it is always on   inside is a little smaller width wise  but still fits 13x9x2 pan ok  paid  169  free shipping and no tax   great deal  i bought this on amazon to replace a sharp microwave  which has served me well for several years  based on the price  compared to other with similar features  this unit is the least expensive  i was also impressed with the comprehensive directions for installation  i am closer to being tim  the toolman  taylor than a professional at home improvements  so i followed the instructions with precision  the results were outstanding  not only does it look great where my old stove hood used to be  it passed my popcorn test  of which  i am particular  no scotching  full bag  satisfying and an extra plus  while i am beaming over my accomplishment  the beep sounds indicating the popcorn was finished  the display read enjoy  am i ever  i have in my digital locker courtesy of amazon  my own  pdf manual  what a great investment in money for the microwave and the time for installation of the unit  br    br   solidly built  looks great  came with lightbulbs for range light installed  no cons  but could have used some help with installing  as the manual recommends 2 people install  but i did manage nicely by myself  i would suggest an additional set of hands for final insertion  once preparations are complete  i have only owned this for a day  but  i wanted to tell my tale to give others an incentive  if they are on the edge  to jump at this opprotunity to snazz up the kitchen in a big way and for little out of pocket  br    br   panasonic wants like  300 for a comparable unit  i am pleased to pay 1 2 as much and get a quality unit such as this  you can even get this for  25 off before january 31st  free shipping  this dude is heavy   and no tax  do the math  it is a steal  when we were remodeling our kitchen we decided to replace our sharp countertop convection microwave with the over the range model  i really miss the old one  this new model seems to be a lot noisier than the old one  i went from 1 5 cubic feet down to 1 1 and it feels like i lost a lot more room than that  the hood light is very dim and the replacement bulbs  2  each cost at least  4 a piece if you can find them  because we had to vent this into the kitchen we had to sent away to sharp for a charcoal filter that cost  20  filter plus shipping and handling   we had planned to vent it to the outside but the vent didn t even come close to matching up the hole from our former range hood  the cooking turntable is white and very had to keep clean  it is only a month old and is very stained already    br   i do like to have the cooking area at eye level    br   i researched the price for comparable items on the web before buying and amazon offered the best price as well as free shipping  i am very pleased with amazon  one week after installing this over the stove  convection microwave  the stainless steel interior began to look spotted  a white cloth rubbed on the area revealed rust which continued growing like a severe rash on all surfaces of the inside  sharp authorized a local service rep to make a housecall and examine it  he concluded the metal interior s defect  whereupon sharp said they would replace  but not pay for reinstallation of  the unit  removing the defective microwave and reinstalling will cost me  140    that wipes out any savings incurred by ordering online  sharp s customer service will not compensate  i would have been much better off buying from my local retailer who would have changed out the piece without charge in a situation like this  live and learn  it is more than one month after the inspection and i have not received the replacement  said to be on back order but still available online        br   aside from the interior cosmetic defect  the microwave looks great and works fine  i see many disgruntled people who have had shipping problems  sharp  does not put enough packing materials in the box to ship these via post office or ups  at 85 lbs the seller needs to double box these and add more packing material and then send via fed ex or dhl at a higher ground rate and customer will be fine  thanks  br   thecloseoutking we ordered one of these and were shipped an open box customer return  the bottom of the unit was dented and the interior was dented  it made a humming vibrating noise during microwave operations   br   amazon shipped us another unit which also was an obvious open box damaged customer return  looks like people are dropping these during the install  then returning and the factory warehouse people aren t even refurbishing them   it was easy to tell it was already used since the exhaust vent was not set to the factory default of recirculating    br   it isn t amazon s fault  in fact they were so quick to ship another unit 2nd day fedex     i wonder if other vendors are seeing this problem     i love the way this looks over my stove  but it looks like they wont be sending another one due to the problems with the warehouse  update  yes i too had the door latch button melt and it does not function any longer it actually was replaced within the 1st year under warranty but now this has happened again a second time and i was only boiling water on the front burner  i see no use in paying for a second repair since i am currently using a pen to pop the door open i will of course have to replace the whole microwave in the near future   i will be soooo happy when i finally do i can t wait to ditch this appliance what a waste  next time i m choosing a regular handle not a push button latch  live   learn   don t they test these designs in practical applications before releasing them to the consumer     won t be buying anything from sharp company any time soon    i purchased this microwave to replace a countertop model  emerson proffesional  stainless steel  i needed a spacesaving feature plus vent for stove and wanted stainless steel to match my other stainless steel appliances   i purchased it from amazon for  275  lowest price i could find and am currently waiting on a  30 rebate from sharp so for the price its not a bad deal   it has no handle that makes it sleek looking and the control panel is hidden behind the door not used to having to set controls before closing door but it makes cleaning easier   my countertop model was of higher quality stainless steel and i only paid  100  for it  on all sides  not just the front like this model  i installed this unit to vent vertically outside the damper is a bit flimsy but hopefully its been tested by sharp for reliability   exhaust fan unit detects heat from stove and automatically operates  unit is a bit noisy on either hi or low setting wish it was quieter the light has hi and low settings either is bright enough  more of a night light feature   overall it work fine and looks good  not a high end unit but then again not a high end price   it does have a nice feature that senses when your food is cooked  used it on potatoes which turned out great at first i was reluctant to purchase this larger appliance that would be shipped through ups for fear it would arrive damaged but ups did a fine job with handling   rated it 3 stars as unit being average and appearance bearing clean lines which boosted my rating  i purchased this item for two reasons  1  because this is a union made microwave assembled in tn  the only american made microwave i ve found   and 2  it has a convection oven that can double as a 2nd oven  br   the styling on this unit is very nice  sleek and not overcomplicated  it enhances the look of my kitchen  br   the microwave cooking is simple  with built in functions for thawing frozen items or popping popcorn  etc   you punch a button  it asks you how many steaks you are defrosting or how much popcorn you are popping and it does the rest  br   convection cooking is new to me  but the manual and recipe booklet that come with the unit have already produced salmon steaks with a white wine basil sauce and cooked a pizza   i ve found that in the heat of the summer i can use this oven vs  my gas oven and it cooks faster and doesn t heat up the house as much   there is also a function that combines microwave and convection cooking to get meals done even faster    there are so many things this machine does  i ve yet to figure them all out  br   a nice feature  you can turn the turntable on off depending on whether you have a round or rectangular dish  br   the unit runs on regular 110 voltage  so no complicated rewiring  br   ge  kenmore and samsung all have similar units  all made in korea  all for the same price or more  i chose this microwave because i was tired of complaining about outsourcing of american jobs and wanted to support a company like sharp that is still making some of their units here in the usa  very nice microwave  great price very nice microwave  great price very nice microwave  great price really love this microwave  has the one touch settings that i wanted along with the  30 seconds button   its a great size for a countertop   it can be a little noisy when it beeps as others have said  was pleased with the packaging and easy instructions to set it up  worth  55 and that it was  prime  34  order  love this microwave   gives me more space in my kitchen    only con is the price  although it slides when you open the door  this is a great product  the size is perfect and it works great  br    br   because of how my kitchen is designed  i cant push my microwave against the wall   if you can  then your microwave will not slide  although it slides when you open the

works perfectly  but you can t put a regular size plate in it  still serves their purpose  i bought this m w for use in an apartment after reading the good reviews on amazon  functionality and performance and even look wise  this has been a great buy  no complaints there  but a couple of important downsides to this microwave   it is loud and keeps beeping even after the timer is done  there is no 30 second timer which is already mentioned in some of the reviews q as  so  that is a fact  just confirming here  very pleased  save space  loved it very pleased  save space  loved it not as fun as i thought i would be am very happy with  this am very happy with  this am very happy with  this am very happy with  this i didn t measure well and this wonderful piece of equipment was much too large so i had to return it so sorry i d have loved to keep it just as advertised   nice looking  easy to clean and large interior    mno problems thus far  great  great  great  installed easily and looks great  it s only been in use for about a month but we have no complaints  fan is quiet  i purchased this in 2010 and it worked great  then a couple of weeks ago i came into the kitchen and saw the se error code  i wasn t able to set the clock so i unplugged it and started researching what the error code meant  as you have probably read in other reviews  this is a common samsung problem  the steam from cooking on the stove underneath the microwave damages the cooking sensor which causes the entire oven to malfunction  and please understand that i haven t used my stove top for cooking on a regular basis  br    br   after a couple of hours  i plugged it in to see what happened and was able to set the clock and use it  i was thrilled but cautious  which was good because within 10 minutes i heard the microwave beep and start cooking  i shut it off and watched it and within 15 seconds  i saw   34 baked potato  34  on the screen and it started up again  so now it s unplugged and will be replaced  br    br   samsung says it s out of the warranty period but will send a technician to fix it for more than it will cost me to purchase a new unit  i did get five years out of it so i m chalking it up to lessons learned   no more samsung microwaves  when they have this many ovens with the same problem  you would think the company would make things write  to be fair  i have always owned samsung televisions and been very happy with them  maybe the microwave business isn t for them  good machine good machine good machine great microwave   simple and compact  great value for the money great value for the money great value for the money great little microwave  fit my microwave cart perfectly and works really well   great microwave at any price   i really think it s more

than the oster ogb8902 b0 9 that i got instead but has electronic problems  good product  stainless inside is easy to clean with rounded corners  designed well  good value for basic microwave looks good  and seems to be holding up a couple of months later  i gotta say    this microwave looks slick in my kitchen  nice led display    sleek metal samsung look    goes nice with my new samsung washer and dryer set    also works great and the controls are laid out intuitively  decent size and good finishing  works great  decent size and good finishing  works great  good unit but a rough sound when operating  excellent microwave   we had very limited counter top space and didn t want to take up a lot of that precious space with a full size microwave oven   this product fit the bill perfectly   it s been working great for several months now  no complaints at all  i purchased this drawer microwave from amazon for a new custom designed kitchen we were installing in our home   my wife couldn t understand why i wanted it because she had never seen one before and didn t think the whole   34 drawer thing  34  was a good idea   she eventually  reluctantly  agreed because she didn t want a microwave to go over the stove and there were no other good options for our kitchen design   once it was installed  she said she liked the looks of it  built into the island    everyone else that has seen it really likes the way it looks also because it s kind of unique   when my wife used it the first time i don t think she wanted to admit i actually had a good idea but the drawer microwave works perfectly and it s easy to get cookware in and out since it s waist high with the door open   my adult son used the   34 sensor reheat  34  button on a restaurant leftover meal he was warming up to eat   the feature evidently   34 senses  34  the air inside the microwave as the meal is cooking and stops automatically when it s ready   pretty cool feature   i love the microwave   it adds to the custom kitchen design look and it works great    i think my wife even smiled one time when she used it  lasted 2 years and then fell apart  the tabs that hold the window in place all broke off on their own  lg does not care since it is out of warranty  they want to charge me over  100 for a new door  it arrived in perfect shape and i just had to plug it in   i have been using it every day even though i have an over the stove one too   it is so handy to do small jobs along with the big one  perfect fit in my tiny kitchen   love the cool blue digital read out  i bought this for a gift for a family member about 500 miles away  he says he s very happy with it and that s all i need to know i bought this for a gift for a family member about 500 miles away  he says he s very happy with it and

about 500 miles away  he says he s very happy with it and that s all i need to know the samsung counter top grill microwave contains a lot of features including a soften melt setting and a grill capability but is probably too large for most countertops  an obvious drawback considering what it is advertised to be for  however  after using this microwave i can say that it works well and  while some its components are plastic  it seems pretty well constructed to me  the grilling feature   the microwave includes a grill and a setting for accomplishing grilling and the soften melt feature are nice  i tried the soften melt feature  for example  and it worked fine  i also think this microwave is attractive so that is not a problem  the only real problem i can see with this microwave is that it is just too large for most countertops  if this is not a problem for you then i recommend this microwave  otherwise  i recommend looking for a smaller microwave  quality merchandise    great value

excellent product and service good good good this is a lovely oven  also a microwave  i have used this for a variety of purposes  as an adjunct to my regular oven and microwave  br    br   i would suggest this as an excellent choice for a counter top oven and microwave  but     make sure that you have the counter space   this is quite large  and the venting in the rear requires some space  i could not put it in a special shelf for the microwave i had  because of the venting    for that reason  i would give this 4 5 stars  as it is not nimble  and is a counter hog  it works fine but can get pretty hot  beautiful      beautiful      beautiful      works great works great works great we decided to put up a chimney exhaust in our new kitchen  so a bulky  over the range microwave was out  plus  we never use it to   34 cook  34  from scratch  why have such a giant wasting space  my dear  handy  wood worker husband built our new cabinets  so it was no problem to create a perfect space under the counter for a new smaller microwave  love the drop down door  plus the features are incredible  slimfry  convection  and grill   note  the samsung is not meant for under the counter  however we were able to provide plenty of air circulation  so it has not been a problem  great for the money great for the money great for the money love it  love it  great unit   we use it in our semi and it

  easy install  no video or instructions required  if you can get out to see where it is  you can get to it and install it  unit is running fine with no issues  this microwave overheats if popping more than two or three bags of popcorn   once it overheats  it automatically switches to the lowest power mode available  thus making it take forever to heat anything  you have to let it rest for 20 minutes or so to cool down  br    br   the microwave works well if you don t use it too much at once   but for more intensive use  buy something more powerful   really nice  really nice  the grill doesn t toast as well as a dedicated toaster oven  but the microwave is fast and easy to use   the fast preheat and the convection oven cook accurately and are perfect for smaller households   i haven

         it looks great   we highly recommend this item  i thought i would wait to make sure everything was working correctly before i commented  the microwave is the perfect fit for my kitchen  it works exactly as expected and i was surprised a dinner plate fits too  it takes up a corner of my counter but it s very sharp looking   i ve had many compliments  i am a very satisfied customer  it is a great microwave   had to replace the one that came with the house  same model  since my boyfriend burned the inside of it   it is quick  quiet and i love all the features about it   easy to keep clean unless you date my boyfriend   then he will burn it one way or another so keep him out of the kitchen  this turntable is exactly like the one that came with the microwave   the original cracked because my son dropped it  so found this one on amazon and it works fine  i have had mine for over a year and it is perfect  no one even notices it and it is using corner space i would not otherwise use  if trying to heat large amounts or use it a defroster or substitute oven then this might be too small for you  however  if you use a microwave for reheating food  cooking small amounts  popping popcorn and heating water it truly is perfect  what a great value  what a great value  what a great value  seemed to work fine in the house but didn t get along with my rv inverter   returned   bigger than most 700 watt units  br      handle sticks out quite a bit so not a   34 space saver  34   not as powerful as i hoped     no issues  i love the product  no issues  i love the product  installed it for peb7226sfss  and it looked great  the only problem was the screws came with it  for mounting to the bracket   were too short  i went to hd purchased longer screws and screwed in perfectly  this is a unique microwave in style and performance  br   it doesn t heat as high as most  but the size and shape is br   what sold me   it fits nicely into a corner of my counter  br   i don t use a microwave for much other than reheating br   things  so this for me is perfect   it is a very basic microwave  br   i really like that the light goes off after a bit if you leave the door open  this microwave has a very elegant design   the engineers were able to minimize its footprint by putting most of its electronics on the bottom instead of on the side   i would prefer green leds instead of blue  but mostly i m happy that it fits on our counter and under the cabinets without taking up much space  love it so far  excellent product  saved our microwave  excellent product  saved our

very good very good very good very good i bought this for an easy to use microwave for my elderly parents  they love it and use it way too much now  great product for the money  great product for the

great price easy to use great price easy to use great for dorm rooms great for dorm rooms great for dorm rooms we have had this microwave for about 6 years now  the light button has just stopped working but everything else works on it still  br    br   pro after reading the manual we were able to type in a button combo that mutes the annoying beep  this was a nice feature to add in  it cooks fine and we are happy with it  br    br   con  minor inconvenience  when cooking popcorn  about 3 bags of it one after another  there is a thermal cutoff sensor that shuts the microwave off if it gets too hot  this is easily solved by just letting the microwave cool off or cooking bags of popcorn on a plate  br    br   this microwave is extremely cheap and if we have to  because it would cost more to replace the control panel light button than it would to replace the whole thing  we would probably buy it again  this is an excellent paint  follow the steps when painting and be sure that you do

bought this microwave for my college dorm room and their isn t a day that goes by that i regret it  br    br   this microwave is relatively quiet and very easy to clean  it is also the perfect amount of watts to keep the university off my back  the light on the clock does not stay lit when micro not in use   when the door opens and shuts  the liquid in a cup or whatever may spill   also when reheating coffee from 7 11 it tips over  ordered because my turntable inexplicably shattered after 5 years  this replacement was listed for my model number  perfect fir  great price  no problems  everything works perfectly  after several months of using  it looks great and it is pretty smart  however  i am annoyed by continuous error beeps  i was going to say despite its size  this is a wonderful microwave  but then i think the small size is the best part   i bought it for my small kitchen  and it s not only adorable  it s a kick ass machine   love it  i ve just had this microwave installed in my new kitchen  i wanted to find one that could go in my island and wouldn t  detract from my new cabinets  it s easy to use and is a great addition to my new kitchen  the parts were just what was needed  they were the correct part as identified  there was no variations and therefore installed just like the parts that were removed  have been working just fine since installed  works  great shipping everthing was good looks really nice above the oven with the microwave if we could a microwave that worked to go with it works  great shipping everthing was good looks really nice above the oven with the microwave if we could a microwave that worked to go with it we bought this for a new construction and haven t used it yet  it looks great and hope it works just as well  the microwave is really ok as for the price  if you don t need to have a  fancy   big microwave and you use it basically just to warm up dishes   it s perfect  br   i tried also to thaw meat there or prepare popcorn   it also works well  br   cons  a little bit noisy when it s ending preparation  popcorn button doesn t work well   program need to be chosen repeated to make sure popcorn is popped br   pros  easy to use  small  built in kitchen timer  cheap this microwave is excellent for the small household and the person who does not do complex cooking   it s full plate size  fine for heat ups and smaller casserole dishes   best of all is the way it fits into a corner   yes it takes up space  is not   34 tiny  34  but fits under cabinets and leaves you more counter space   controls are easy to set   haven t had a microwave in years  and somebody suggested this   i m happy with it  purchased this microwave for my husband s semi truck   it would not run on the large inverter installed in the truck   fought with it for several days until i decided it would work great here at home    i love that it takes up so little room on my counter   it s perfect for the one or two person household   i love the microwave but their answer to how do you clean the glass door was  cover your food and you shouldn t have to clean it  i always cover my food yet sometimes the saran wrap breaks and things splatter  how you could put a fine grate between the food and the glass and expect food not to splatter is beyond me  samsung  makes great tv s and electronics  but stay away from appliances as they obviously do not have a clue  in the meantime  i paid top dollar for what i thought was a great product  little did i know i m now stuck with something that makes me look like i m a total slob in my kitchen  thanks samsung  love this microwave  it heats food   drink up fast  i love love love the compact size  counter top clutter is one of my pet peeves so this definitely opens up some counter space  it s so cute too  just needed for a touch up br   but works great   will keep br   on hand if see another chip br   to be fixed this is a great product  fixed my microwave like it was brand new  i would highly recommend it to anyone who has some paint chipping off the sides or top of their microwave this is a great microwave combination convection oven  the knob dial is actually very nice and initially was hesitant about getting it because of that  but now my wife and i truly love it this is a great microwave combination convection oven  the knob dial is actually very nice and initially was hesitant about getting it because of that  but now my wife and i truly love it we needed a microwave that was not very deep and a bit wider to fit in our cabinet  we struggled to find the right dimensions for our built in cabinet cubby  this one is a perfect fit  i was concerned it would not be powerful enough since the watts are lower than many others  so far it has worked great for our needs  plus it looks great in the space  we needed to create a little more space on the kitchen counter and this unit was perfect   nice looking machine and tucks into a corner   would recommend to others  chosen for it s size  this microwave is pretty perfect for us  we use it for simple warm ups and reheating  it works great  br    br   it is surprisingly very heavy  arrived very well packaged  br    br   i love how it sits back in the corner of the counter with the curved back  this is an excellent microwave and very big   i am so very pleased with this product   i think it is the favorite of my grand kids in the kitchen  this is an excellent microwave and very big   i am so very pleased with this product   i think it is the favorite of my grand kids in the kitchen  the microwave has work very nice  a bit pricy thou but in the long run it will have been a good inventment as my wife loves to coooook  i had to  order 3 of these because the first two arrived damaged  after the third one was installed it looks great and works great  i got it just before thanksgiving so i used it as an oven so i then had two ovens which came in very handy  i had to  order 3 of these because the first two arrived damaged  after the third one was installed it looks great and works great  i got it just before thanksgiving so i used it as an oven so i then had two ovens which came in very handy  the unit was purchased to replace an old whirlpool unit that had performed flawlessly for 20 years  although none of the holes lined up the sharp unit fit perfectly into the space above our cooktop  so far the unit has performed as advertised  i bought this microwave about two years ago  and it still looks and functions great   have not had a single issue     when shutting  yet works well and seems to be a good value for the price  i guess i just miss the more sleek  less noisy one that broke after 9 years     this microwave is very cute  there s no other word to describe it    and as promised is good for small spaces  it does seem to require more cook time than most microwaves i am used to  and sometimes it is a pain to have to keep holding the   sign to increase time  as opposed to just typing in the number  so far i have had no issues  and the unit is not very noisy at all which is nice  this is stuff  it really worked very well  it save me a great deal of money having to replace a microwave that still works very well  i highly recommend this product  i researched many microwaves for our needs  and this is the perfect unit  it is my second one  as the first i had special ordered to be delivered to a big box store  it arrived damaged  this one arrived fine  well packaged for the trip  it cooks evenly in the convection mode and as a microwave it is fabulous  it arrived when promised  i would definitely buy from this seller again  purchase was a good one   love the design of the microwave  and so far it meets all my needs   being short  the drawer is much more comfortable for me   the process of ordering and receiving from amazon was simple  efficient and has been one of the best purchases i ve made in the whole kitchen reno project  thanks amazon  did the job  great coverage  made the inside of the microwave look almost brand new  very satisfied   would purchase again did the job  great coverage  made the inside of the microwave look almost brand new  very satisfied   would purchase again this kenmore microwave eats microwave tubes like 1 every year  since tubes are now made in far east  instead of by raytheon  quality as dropped  i now expect to replace tube yearly and budget for it  it was nice to find a tube with diode  which has never failed  for such a great price  fits perfect and works great never

received on time  but with damage on the door and left side and with out grill i m not so happy it is a basic microwave and so far working very well  br   it fit perfect over our oven range  br   my husband and his friend s help needed for taking old one out and setting this microwave up  br   door feels very light  we are used to the metal one  so we get gentle on it  when ordering cabinet for microwave i had no clue that sharp offered a drawer oven that would fit into the cabinet perfectly   it looks so great and works beautifully  when ordering cabinet for microwave i had no clue that sharp offered a drawer oven that would fit into the cabinet perfectly   it looks so great and works beautifully  so far it has worked fine with no service calls   i will keep you posted in future years   given how nicely it fits in our kitchen island  i would probably buy another one even if it lasted only 2 years   update   finished year 4 with no problems   still very happy  bought this cutie for the outdoor kitchen in my rv   i had limited space to work with so this was the perfect choice for me   the unit sits in one corner of the outdooor kitchen counter leaving me enough room to add a hot plate as well  br    br   great item at a great price   enough power to handle all routoine microwave tasks  i bought a used micro that works great but needed a little   34 tweaking  34  for paint touch p inside  br   this did the job  it is so nice  it works  is small  has a wonderful shape  it is an acquisition for my kitchen  i recommend it  after following the instructions it fixed my rusty microwave oven  i m happy i had found this product  now i don t have to pay a costly repair bill  great small size  looks good  fits in a corner and does not take up a lot of apace  and works very well  have owned sharps in past   this fit perfectly above stove  no alterations  no fuss   works great  looks great  would recomend i receive so many compliments about this cutie in our second kitchen  we have little counterspace in the area and this is worth every penny  works great  and a spectacular space saver  highly recommended  fits very nicely in a corner spot and doesn t take up much room which is nice when you do not have much counterspace this was exactly the one i needed i wasn t sure i would be able to find the one i needed but i did and loved the fact i received it sooner than expected this microwave has many good features and fit great into our over the counter space in our kitchen  it was easy to install and has been very reliable  ge makes good products  but don t expect it to last forever  we replaced our old ge microwave that had lasted only about 7 years with this one  the primary reason i bought another ge spacemaker was due to the size configuration that matched our old microwave  i did not want to have to replace my cabinets to have a different sized microwave  while redoing our kitchen  i discovered this microwave and i love it   i was concerned about lack of a turntable but after a month of use  i have founds foods to be heated evenly   the popcorn button works great and i love how easy it is to program things like defrost  melt butter  warm syrup  beverages  etc     most of all  i am thrilled to have the microwave off the counter and the drawer style is a must when mounting in a base cabinet  we were reluctant to spend so much on a microwave as we are not big microwave users but we absolutely love this and are glad we splurged  it defrosts without cooking  won t burn popcorn  can soften butter without melting  and of course looks amazing  its easy to clean and was pretty easy to install   if i had to come up with a shortfall there is a height limit so forget tall items like those rice express packages   still worth it and would still recommend it  none available  many more features than advertised  reading the manual is highly advised to get the most out of this product  it even has an automatic fan function for over a range use if there s too much heat buid up  great little microwave  it s the perfect size  it s a little underpowered  so a add 30 secs to most cooking times  br   small footprint and looks great in the kitchen  i needed a smaller sized microwave to fit on my kitchen counter top  and i couldn t find anything smaller than a 0 7 cu  ft  in any store   since this one had so many good reviews  i decided to give it a try   it not only fits perfectly on my tiny kitchen counter  but it is also the best microwave i ve ever owned   it fits regular sized dinner plates so it s the perfect size  and it heats up very quickly   i would recommend this to anyone especially if you have a small kitchen  we purchased and installed the drawer oven in august 2010  while doing a remodel in our kitchen   it was a more expensive option  but it fit perfectly in a location between our fridge and sink area  and maintained the contour of the kitchen we were seeking   we use it at least two or three times a day  and have been very pleased with its performance  and we have not had any problems with it   it does not have a turntable  however  our experience is it does the job just as well   it is easy to get to and easy to clean   it does not have a huge interior  so if you have plans to microwave tall items  check the dimensions first so that you are not surprised by that   overall  we have found it to be a very nice addition to our kitchen  and would purchase one again  it worked great at home  but we got it for our truck  but our 1500 watt inverter can t run it  so it fit great in the freightliner truck  but u gotta have a bigger inverter  it worked great at home  but we got it for our truck  but our 1500 watt inverter can t run it  so it fit great in the freightliner truck  but u gotta have a bigger inverter  the only thing i would chande is the push handle   sometimes it diesn t work the first time and it feels like it sticks   otherwise  a good product and good value  this is the perfect sized microwave for my kitchen  the domed shape works great on my smaller counter top  would recommend it  this is the perfect sized microwave for my kitchen  the domed shape works great on my smaller counter top  would recommend it  i have benn using this mivrowave for about a month now and it is great  it is easy  to use and powerful when cooking a microwave meal and the packing tell you to put in in for 3 min  and 30 sconds  your meal will come out nice and hot  this microwave is munch beatter then the lg one i had  any one looking for a good microwave should look in to this one  don t belive the bad reviews  because i have had this microwave for a month now and i have had no problems with it  i got my microwave from home depot  a similar model that we got when we bought our home 6 years ago died and we needed the exact sized model to replace it because the old model was built into a non adjustable shelve frame above the counter top   searched websites and found what i wanted   then searched amazon and found one with the best price    abe s of maine    quick delivery and the packaging crating was extraordinary   would buy product again  and would buy from abe s of maine again  fits perfectly in our countertop corner   fits in the   34 dead space  34  there  br   it s on the small side  but it is perfect for our needs  exactly what i wanted  it s the perfect fit  works just fine    bye bye bulky hand me down    i m handing you down  lol was great until i opened the door and the microwave inlet cover is  what     cardboard       which i touched

microwave works just great for that  it might also have great features    i just don t know them   br    br   pros  good price  easy to install  nice lights for stovetop  can be configured to vent or recirculate  looks good  br    br   cons  the fan is less effective than a range hood  which is a given for any over the range microwave  and not as quiet as i would hope  br    br   other thoughts  the beep is long  but not much louder than any other microwave    i see a lot of comments about it  but it hasn t bothered us   overall  we like this microwave and are happy with the purchase  from the moment i took it out of the box  it looked beautiful  fit perfect in my small newly remodeled kitchen and works great  i put some money into my new kitchen with a very nice looking back splash in tile and glass  i did not want my old large white microwave oven taking up one entire wall  i don t use the microwave that much  so this is perfect   it s not all that powerful but if you are buying something to heat things up or make popcorn and you want style and beauty   this is it  we love this microwave  it looks great and has given us a lot more space in the corner where nothing but the old clunky microwave was  our kitchen looks so much more modern and the microwave itself fits everything  including our largest dinner plates   heating will require an additional 20 30 seconds but definitely worth the wait    can t say enough about how cool it looks  none available  easy to install  user friendly instructions   came in good condition   manual very easy to understand and use

of complaining we got them to authorize a free service call  i bought this microwave 18 months ago from sears and it looked good and worked just fine until the se error message came up a week ago  then the keypad stopped working  we tried plugging and unplugging  and i have tried all of the fixes found online but to no avail  i am now planning to replace it with a quality product  so much for

bright and the controls are so easy to use  i love how the entire front sure is flat   makes for really easy clean up  i would so buy this again and again  whirlpool s description of this microwave is spot on  br    br   the only thing that would be nice would be a numeric keypad  but there really isn t space given the compact design  br    br   we have oversized dinner plates  and they fit in here with very little to spare  which means this microwave is perfect for us  just purchased this microwave and it is so loud that it seems like there is a semi tractor trailer idling in my kitchen  we could neither hear the television nor have a normal volumed conversation with it on   everything else on the unit seemed great  but won t get to explore them as we will be returning it  i ve had two service calls with this microwave within the one year warranty   if it goes again  they tell me i am on my own  shame on whirlpool  i suspect that it may be more efficient to purchase a new microwave instead of having a service call for a circuit board that continues to be an issue  i d steer away from this one     i ve had this microwave for a year now  and it has performed flawlessly  it also looks great  and is very easy to clean  inside and out  the best thing is the one touch start for things like tea and re heating  i don t feel like i have to program a computer just to make something

product   installed well and works great   some reviewers commented on the way the door closes  but i have found it to be just fine   hopefully it will last a long time   i would recommend   3 2013 update   the microwave has worked flawlessly for the past year   very pleased with it   with lots of use and much by teenagers  it has shown to be sturdy and solidly built thus far   it also cooks very efficiently   still happy and would still recommend  this item works great  was pretty easy to install and matches our kitchen  exactly what it says in the description  arrived on time  we have no complaints whatsoever with this item  i would definitely recommend it  microwave mco165uw  over heats and turns off   first week had repairman out  ordered parts  after 3 weeks magic chef still had not sent parts  sent them 2 day   repairman came back out and replaced parts   still overheated   magic chef said heat water if it does not turn off it works like it is suppose to   cannot steam vegetables  cook baked potatoes and so forth   who buys a microwave just to heat water   do yourself a favor and never buy magic chef  wow  wow  wow  i was somewhat concerned about purchasing a microwave over the internet  but how great it was  i was even more than satisfied with the product it looks wonderful and works great as well  the price was less than the one we saw in the store and the delivery time was faster than what the computer stated  i had it install the same day and i am very happy about this product and the overall purchase  i know you will too  after 1 year of light use  maybe 3x per week to warm leftovers   the sensor stopped working and now the microwave does not heat anything   the cost to repair is more than the appliance is worth  the ge profile countertop microwave 2 2 cu ft  is not only a sleek looking appliance on our counter but is easy to use and allows for large capacity food items   very satisfied with our purchase  great product   fits perfectly in the space we have for it and works like a charm   sleek and effective  great product   fits perfectly in the space we have for it and works like a charm   sleek and effective  great product   fits

microwave is incredible   very quiet and the convenience of a drawer is great   easy to use and to clean  i wanted a microwave that took up as little counter space as possible  had sensor cooking and was easy to use   this one fit all that criteria and had a bonus   a beverage key which i use a lot to heat water to the perfect temp for tea   this microwave is perfect for my needs and i m very happy with it   the only downside is that the quality is only average  my husband   i were looking for a microwave for my daughter   her husband for a christmas gift   this is the same brand that we have   are very happy w  it   this is exactly what we were looking for   so happy to find it   such a reasonable price   their home is nearing completion   they are so excited to install this microwave   start using it   our daughter said that she just loves the modern look   knows that it ll look wonderful w  all their other stainless steal appliances  we ve owner this product for several years now   it looks nice and works great   amazon handles the shipping of this heavy product with ease so you don t need  to be concerned about it getting to you in top condition  as good or better than i hoped  lots of options  fan is great  it is noisier than my old one  as per other reviews  but really   it doesn t matter that much  we have had this microwave for about a month and absolutely love it   well worth the price   it is super convenient  you can see and stir the food without removing it from the oven   cooks evenly and quickly   easy to use and clean  very attractive  a conversation piece as well  too many problems for a high end microwave  after 1 year of use  the handle broke  the convection piece of it will not work  stay away from this product  excellent price and product  2 day shipping with amazon prime   another really good investment    this has turned out to be a very good buy as a replacement for a sears kenmore over the range microwave   which was useless from day one  it fits well  very secure mounts and easy to use template  oven itself is easy to use  quiet  powerful  excellent venting  in our case out the top   to the roof   everything has been easy to clean so far  including the buttons and window   i put it in myself   but two person job would have been a better choice  really like the sensor cooking  so i don t have to figure out how long it will take to burn the rice this time      definitely recommend this oven  this is awesome  love it  it was easy to install  cooking and defrosting is very well  and the shipping was early  very happy overall  the microwave works beautifully   the installation instructions left something to be desired  but we figured it out  this black lg over the range microwave is just what we needed   it arrived in good condition with clear directions and fits perfectly     we re happy customers  great microwave at great price   i bought one from amazon com last month for  199   it arrived in one week   no shipping charge   looks great   works great   installed easily    professionally installed for  65    nice clean lines   easy to operate   hit the button once for one minute   hit it again

microwave   it works very well   has easy to follow directions and looks great  the microwave oven arrived on time and in excellent condition   we have tested it to make sure it works   it was just

works   it was just installed so we haven t used it a lot yet     completely happy   excellent amazon service as usual  i have never owned a convection oven before  i love it  living in the south and only cooking for 2 people  why heat up the whole kitchen   it s so easy to use  i bake everything in it now  i also use most of my pampered chef stones in it for even easier clean up  pros  br   large br   fast and even heating br   great defrost br   not too loud br    br   cons  br   sensor reheat is only good for soups and other substance that it is okay to heat to boiling  don t trust it with pizza  or other foods like that   br    br   bottom line   this is an excellent large microwave for countertop use   the inverter defrost works almost perfectly every time  never cooking my food more than it should  but the reheat is a gimmick  br    br   this is a large countertop microwave  at about 2 2 cubic foot   coming from an over the range microwave this is a huge improvement in size   the microwave heats uniformly and fast  it is 1200 watts    the sensor reheat should only be used on foods it is safe to boil  otherwise it overcooks about everything else   it also works best when you lightly cover the food  as sometimes uncovered food triggers it to turn off too early   lightly covered is critical  as the sensor works off water vapor temperature being released from the product   if the water vapor cant leave the container it could become superheated   sensor cook should also only be used under supervision  you should be in the same room   br    br   i have had the microwave for about 6 months now with no issue   it is no louder than other microwaves i have used  and the controls are intuitive and easy to use   you do not have to press a cook button or anything to start your timed cooking   my favorite feature is the inverter defrost   remember you enter the weight in pounds  so for an 8 oz pack of bacon you would enter 5 and start for 1 2 of a pound   if you had a 1 5 pound package of meat  you would enter 15 and start for 1 5 pounds   the display shows the weight correctly  not much else to say about the product  it is a microwave after all  br    br   update  to improve sensor reheat performance  use a lid over the food with a vent hole   i use a paper plate with a small hole  finger tip size  punched in it   this will make sure the reheat stays running long enough  but still gets some water vapor to judge the food temperature by so it doesn t over cook  br    br   update  6 26 2010   i have been using the microwave 2 years now   it has been no issue and still works perfectly   i use the sensor reheat almost all the time for soups and casseroles  and use the inverter defrost for my frozen goods   i also use the popcorn button to heat microwave popcorn bags   everything has been working great  br    br   update  7 26 2011   still going strong   i use the inverter regularly for defrost  or lowering the power level to cook something slower   it has worked well for me  and i think problems might be from shipping  quality control  or some other factor  br    br   update  3 21 2013   still going strong  but maybe a bit noisier now   no issue

ever had  they love the one touch features as well as the large cooking area  would recommend if you want a dependable and spacious microwave  we purchased this itme for a family member for christmas  they love it  said its the best microwave they ever had  they love the one touch features as well as the large cooking area  would recommend if you want a dependable and spacious microwave  i had a same model of microwave which worked for me about   4to 5 years very good and that was the reason i ordered the same brand and model again    the new one so far has been very good too but the one way blocking door over the exhaust fan was noisy which i swapped it with the  older one and fixed the problem overall is very good and i like it  this was a great buy   i read the other reviews and they are right on the money  easy to put up but it goes easer with two people but one can do it and everything you need is their and it works great  my sharp convection  over the range mirowave is perfect  other brands have a protruding handle   could hit tall people in the face  the handle on my new sharp is flush and much more stylish  my husband installed it  the instructions were great  sharp has designed the shipping box to be used as a lifter and holder to assist the installer    br   the best thing was the excellant service from amazon  and i saved over  200  thank you amazon and sharp     this microwave works pretty good   the sensor cook is awesome and will reheat or cook items almost perfectly   the only bad thing i ve seen is that it s got a rather large footprint  we really like this microwave but more we like how easy it was to get it from amazon   it really has a good convection oven  although is somewhat noisy with the fan   it was very easy to install and came with very clear instructions   amazon delivered it quickly and it was the best price as anywhere
