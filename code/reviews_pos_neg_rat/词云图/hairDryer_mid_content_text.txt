styling hair in style like this as well as the one i had before  no complaints the diffuser made my curly hair really frizzy and messy  it suddenly can t turn on days ago  a non working product  just west of time and energy  well they refund my money but i don t recommend this product  this thing is still going almost a year later buttons interfere with handle   always turning off god product does not turn off  junk    the diffuser does not fit on the dryer  my whole reason for purchasing this item  did not work in italy gets the job done  downfall is the bonnet connection keeps popping off so you must keep reattaching it  not use yet  but i like it  excelente     got this for my mom  it is a bit heavier than she d like but overall she loves it  excelente it gets the job done  excelente worked in middle east i like the hair dryer please don t buy this  i used this for just 3 or 4 times and now started getting coil burning smell when i turn it on  it should go to trash now  excelent bought this for my girlfriend  she loves it  with the exception of colors  this appears to be the same as an earlier model of the same brand i owned   that was reliable for several years until slowing speed required replacement  problems using with uk adaptor the hose and bonnet  does not  stay connected    it needs to have  way to lock it in place  like it i like it  does what it s supposed to  cord retract is a bitch to work   have to screw with it to get it to take it all in  too bulky  working excellence  no problems with it  works for me  thank you muy bueno  i couldn t use it because it did not have an ul listed cord on it excelente this unit caught on fire within 3 months of purchase have had mine for several years and am thinking about getting another one as a back up  blew out coils after 2 weeks of use  it works very well and i use it everyday  basic hair dryers for a wm price   why stand in line when you can get on amazon for the same price   i bought one for each bathroom in a rental property  this hair dryer is not adjustable and does not have enough heating power not enough blow      my wife loves it    piece of junk   the cord keeper feature is a joke   the only place the cord keeper keeps it is outside of the dryer   do not buy cord no longer retracts  buenisimo the only con is that it doesn t reach the back of my head  i d have to put a pillow under my butt and lower my head and just sit there for a while  and that cramps up my neck a lot    save a lot of time  my wife loves it  i was so excited to use this hair dryer for the first couple of months  then ad some of the other customer reviews had stated it quit working   the heating part of it just stopped about 6 months in  so sad     two speeds and two heat settings   does not have air only setting  yes    wife loves it  gf brought it and loves it  i am a guy and don t use it myself  i ve had this hairdryer for 7 months  and today it died  this dryer is just what i wanted  the cord is so short i have to stand at the plug longer than i thought it was from the picture   actual dimensions are needed  worka well wife likes it i only got to use it 1 5 times when i was in the middle of using it the second time when it sparked and burned out     i would like a refund but don t know how to go about it  i used to have one that lasted for 10 years befo re ti burned out delivered on time   as described work so well we bought two  tended to make my hair frizz instead of curl replaced a like unit which had lasted 6 years everyone loves it does the trick this hair dryer will suck your hair into the air intake  awesomeness works well for my application  bought for my mother  and it does what it is supposed to do  this thing is a miracle worker  my curls have never look bigger and bouncier  dries as it should with aesthetic looks  my roommates couldn t keep their hands off this vickie loves it   send it back did t work just like we use when we travel  mariott uses these  doesn t fold      would have preferred a stronger airflow bought this for my daughter   she loves it  except there is no diffuser but she has managed  works well underpowered  none item delivered on time  was as described the lower setting does not work bought this as a gift for my mother and she loves it  stopped working after 3 months  simply doesn t work  over priced junk ty this i gave as gift   it blew up within one month     it works as it should be working i want to  return this because it does not have a plug  burned out about 4 months after i bought it  total bummer  i have used conait hair dryers for years and never had an issue before  this one was a bust     i couldn t find a blow dryer this would stay on without popping off  i went through about 5 different ones  lobe it works as well as more expensive products of similar type  just what i was wanting    i wish i had this dryer forever  works well  granddaughter loves it met my expectations  cord doesn t retract all the way return is no longer needed as described works well  shipping was spot on  i didn t receive the straightening pic that came with the dryer  was not the red one i wanted  but is sufficient  wife loves it  as of now no complaints  it s quiet and does the job  the brush attachment doesn t work well through the hair exceeded my expectations  the vulcano of hair dryers excelente producto i like it i like how big the diffuser head is  i returned it  it doesn t work when i plugged it in it didn t work how do i return it broke after 2 uses  but it couldnt be returned because i was in a different country a gift no feedback from recipient  i had this blow dryer before but i dropped it had to get another one  and i luv it my home use blower  works well  buen producto works well just prefect for me     i like this product my bathroom looks neater my daughter loves i like exec second one i purchased for wife and daughter works like it should  i like it bought for my wife  she says she loves it  no ten paragraph review needed here  worked well and as described   motor started to sound like a lawn mower  one week after it s one year warranty  br   not happy  does its job  works well  i wish this could be much smaller exelente it an excelent  product i bought it for my maine coon cat  he likes this dryer  just started using     quiet yet efficient  the disk somehow smells like plastic dvice work with 110 ac and my home 220  also not writ in amazon abut ac tks met my expectations  the hood collapses  the hood does not stay mounted does it job but too noisy pretty average  just what i needed  though  about what i expected  for the money  quit heating after 60 days  recomendado  wife loves it daughter loves it only last for one year  can t bla the company but this item does not work  it falls off with the suction cups and can cause issues  save your money  stopped working in 5 weeks wife loves it  i purchased the product for its retractable cord and this did not work  would not recommend now this is what u call a blow dryer yea muy bueno works exelente does the job bueno works  died after about 6 months of use was as described and worked well  it works well  it s a blowdryer  my wife loves it  uses it all the time  thank you my gf loves it  she says it does no damage to her hair and she uses no heat protection treatment  bought this for my daughter she has no complaints it did not work has held up for over year now  i only use it about once a week though u get what you pay for i like it  as advertised i like it but the lady of the house would like a smaller one easier to manuver bought as a gift and my mom loves it  excelente works well and has multiple heat settings and speeds  excelente   cord does not retract majority of the time bought for my wife and she loves it   no complaints broke after using it for two weeks excelente muy bueno just what i wanted daughter loves it    wife loves it  lasted all of 10 minutes before failing  bought as gift     it is just as advertised  does work well   durable for a year now  thought it was smaller   a wife loves it don t need a towel anymore in college  k smell burning from the dryer quite noisy compared to others we have had  retraction cord has to be jiggled in order to retract  need to be very specific on hanging cord or inside wiring  muy bueno i ve been using this for the past 3  almost 4 years and it still works the same way as when i first took it out of the box  my wife loves it  i gave this to my daughter for christmas   she said that she loves it  connectors always comes off  overheats  put on medium setting and it gets the job done  not 100  what i wanted but it works  excelent  i don t remember why i sent this back  but i think it was because it did not fold up closely enough  ml like it  worked for a while  then  it broke  i bought it a month ago  do not buy it  bueno        this was a gift to my daughter   she loves it  dries fantastically and leaves my hair shiny the diffuser works well   when it isn t falling off my dryer  i just bought a conair 276r infiniti pro volume dryer  and the diffuser starts to pop off the hair dryer once the unit warms up  i wouldn t recommend it for this hair dryer  but it might work well for others  working out well  it works well for me  works well the only problem is the tip wont stay on works well works well  no problems  dryes hair superfast  we have purchased three of these and they do not last  this last purchased lasted 7 months  will not purchase this item again  my wife loves it  the bonnet is not big enought for big roller i would definitely not recommend purchasing this product as it is a safety hazard  i had an issue with the dryer sparking and smoking at the electrical outlet and had to get rid of it  the circuit protector never worked properly to warn of an electrical problem  i see where this has been an issue for others and believe bespoke should recall the t3 before they get sued for the outbreak of a fire  it only worked for 6 weeks  it is sturdy and works as described  relatively quite  wish it had a retractable cord  plenty of both air and heat  burning smell had to return it after use lots of power  makes a noise like its broke as advertised  my favoret works well did not stay on  dries hair in minutes   confinent   this is lightweight and quiet and seems to keep my hair smoother  sounds like it will burn out  comes with a case and ultra compact  the needles were not log enough   i returned it i have wanted this for christmas two years in a row and finally someone in my family purchased it  now they want one  use it every day  i don t know if i have one on order or not    just ordered another one   because of the price     we ll see  i always used salon hair dryer  compare to that this is only 4 star my expectations were met the only problem i have with this product is that the comb are not durable exelente it s like holding a jackhammer   a purchased as a guest bathroom hairdryer  between the retractable cord and the folding feature  it fits neatly in a drawer  works well wife loves it  wish it had a cooling button  works well  excelent works for the international traveler  this is a must   works there and at home as well  it s doing wonders to my girlfriend s hair  she loves it there is spark fire come from inside i think this is defective one returned it purchased this years ago and i am still using it till this day  stopped working after only 7 months    my mother uses ever day muy bien could never get the wattage adjusted    cracked the handle before it was used  purchased for my wife  and she loves it  not adjustable  my neck hurts  i need to exchange it for another hair dryer no comment bought as a christmas present     the attachments don t stay on too well and the cord is really short  the hair dryer is just what i wanted     could not believe the improvements made to hair dryers since i purchased the last one 15 or so years ago  pros      price    cons      build quality  way bigger size and noise it works well well   i purchased this item just for weatherizing my windows and it worked for that  convient works well  no issues  muy bueno excelente luv it  very low air pressure  must have got a dud but ours died  just like the ones in hotel  i like that the speed of the blower is separate from the heat selection  exclent product  just two minutes tondy my hair without damage works well bulky and too noisy   easliy installed and works well      it did not fir my hair dryer  make hair blowing time a breeze arrived as promised use it every day we have used this  for 7 years   we have four and have only replaced 2   visitor dropping it  slipped out of hand  like the ease of use  speed and form  this dryer replaced my dryer of 4 years and has a lot of power  i would recommend it to everyone  works well and not too noisy  received on time and as descried  replacing earlier unit  same model  found only on amazon   conforme con la venta y recomiendo al vendedor works well  lite weight for travel or home  dood excelente producto llego en el tiempo previsto recomiendo a la tienda nunca recibi el producto  me gustaria que me repusieran el dinero por favor just what i wanted  excelente hair dyer stopped working within one month   not reliable   as advertised i like it  meets my expectations  thank you exelente  exelente my third t3  bueno hair dryer blew up the third time i used it  haven t used mine yet but my girlfriend has one and she loves it    works well and very quiet   reduced drying time on my tricky hair  brush attachment will not go through my hair  used comb attachments only  excellant just received died as soon as it was plugged in  despite having it on the correct power setting  i bought this blow dryer in mid of may 2014 and it stopped working in mid of october 2014  would never buy it again     it was damaged when received  now i have to pay to return it  excelente just a hair dryer  it does its job  no complaints  i had to send two back   they both were broke   one ran for about 30 seconds          used it three times and it died  used this for our trip to europe with no issues  you cant beet this dryer at any price  heat stops working sometimes  still blows air  lasted 9 months     purchased december 14  2013    died september 25 2014   what happened to the hair dryers that used to go for 10 years   this one the cord started heating up and then it just stopped working   probably the 4th hair dryer i ve bought my wife in 5 years     i guess they are just a disposable item now  turbo  girlfriend and lady friend both use it  worked well in turkey  muy bueno purchased for my friend  she states it works well  does what it s supposed to do  this hair dryer is just what i need  stayed at a hotel that had this specific dryer  it worked so well  i ordered it from amazon before i even returned home for the trip  you ve seen them in hotels for years and you wish you had one at home   now i do   i returned it and it was somewhat costly as i had to pay return postage  i have had a few conair hair dryers  but this one with the folding handle really saves space in my bag  excelente works as advertised  tiny  almost toy like  decided to stick it in the cabinet for an emergency backup  i loveeeeeeeeee it it does not give enough power using the 220v i have never rated this product by given it a 5 star  and i have never wrote a review for this product  br   thank you  br   ms  marlene farrell trent broke after two months  heat function no longer functions  bought it as a gift   she loves it  causes circulate every time  i being using the same blow dryer for 8 years n i lake it  geat every use and home this is a back up for the one just like it  only a different color  lots of power        exwife seemed to like it  just what we needed for our travel bag  i like it the unit started smoking today when in use   the built in gfci fried after just over a months use  bought for husband   he loves it  which this model came with attachments  buenisimo thank you  handle would spark when turning on and off i thought it would be smaller  for traveling  this item broke in the second time i used  i am totally returning it  it melted into a pool of plastic in just a couple months   forget it   this is junk no problems  arrived as promised  as described  on sale   thank you  a bit noisy did not like this item  retractable cord broke in 2 weeks  i would not recommend this product  everything i wanted in a hair dryer   power      worked well  died after a year of use  works well  no issues  too noisy  perfecto my wife loves this blowdryer   a    excelent says quiet on description however it was the loudest hair dryer ever   they should remove quiet from the description  pro quality hair dryer   same model as used by wife s hair stylist  this is a must have    can t thank you enough  bien yes it works in ireland  remember to change the voltage selector  and only use it on low  which seemed like medium to me   work as what it was intended to do  drys hair  i bought this several years ago but i still use it   this is a quiet  well made blow dryer that works very well   it s expensive  but it s worth it  to bulky for travel  buenisimo as is likely with all hair dryers that have the retractible cord  it already quit working and i bought it in october 2013  eight months later already quit  the two stars it got is for ease of drying your hair  the problem i have with this product is that even with a medium heat  the comb attachments melt  there is no warning on the manual whatsoever on what heat stand should be used in order to prevent the comb attachments from melting  i am grateful to amazon for replacing my damaged items exelente excelente my daughter loves it motor went out after only a couple uses  the blow dryer blew out the second i plugged it into the wall  i bought it 10 month ago  its quality can be trusted  item broke after 3 uses  i gave this a four because the adapter that fits on the end constantly falls off  looking for something smaller than this to travel with  when you don t feel like itting under a dryer or blw drying your hair this is what you need  i can carry it around the house whille it drys your hair  title says it all  i have no issues with the heat of this dryer  but the cord is very short  i need an extension cord to use it   and the nozzles fall off constantly  worked well until it burned out  worked well with both voltage settings  it trash now  would not recommend this dryer  size and weight are what i had hoped for when purchasing this dryer for my upcoming trip overseas  can t wait one of the cheaper options for a hair dryer  i like the color and the diffuser works well for those with curly hair  this one replaced one which disappeared when my daughter went home   it should last until it disappears like the last one  bespoke labs sent me an 1800 watt model   my wife opened it and began using it the day it arrived  so i never had a chance to dispute bespoke labs shipping me the wrong item   she likes it and continues using it  and i must admit it does the job quite well  but it was not what i ordered and not what i paid the premium for   therefore  i am giving 1 star as a judgment more about bespoke labs than the product i received  for the price i paid  i have no complaints  it works for me   gets the job done           hair dryer works well   it was inexpensive but still offered three speeds and three heat settimgs   would recommend purchase of this product  i have purchased these over the years and like the fact that this one had a nite lite  i am still using this particular one and still have one i bought previously without a nite lite  i have been using it now for almost 2 years with no problems yet   still blows like the day it came out of the box until it stopped working  the nightlight still worked but the hair dryer would not turn on again  after a year of use  couldn t get through to anyone on the phone  finally had to return it and try another brand    i got this for my daughter for she like to do her hair a lot and washes it every day we orde our 2nd hairdryer because same spot in the bathroom hholes already  br    br   but the drer doesnt last   1  year my wife used this hair dryer at the heathman hotel in portland and had to buy them for our vrbo  in bend or  our vrbo 304450 incase you want to try the hair dryers    similar to some reviewers  initially i became fond of this specific type of hair dryer when i was lodging in a hotel  the hair dryer has several combinations of blowing temperature and speed  i like the fact that its lowest wind level is low enough  unlike some of the hair dryers on the market which are way too power even set on the lowest switch  i found this item on amazon and the price is unbeatable  recommend  my wife requested it because she already had one at our 1st home and wanted one just like it for our 2nd home  i have only had this for alittle over a month and it broke today  will never buy another one from here  can t beat it for the price  has all the options you need  i would recommend to anyone  also like that it s fairly quiet  only lasted about a year and then burned up   it is only used once a day or so and you would think it should last longer  this is my second vidal sassoon dryer  br   i bought a second one for travel  br   i like the fact that it has 3 heat and 2 speed settings  br   i may just get another for future use  this is very  very quiet  it has the longest cord  i have ever seen on a dryer  i don t understand the ion thing  this hair dryer works well  i like its capacity while using it on my hair  i would recommend this product to any one who is looking for a simple dryer  this dryer rocks   my daughter bought one for me last year and all of a sudden the heating element stopped working   i had to buy another  this brand is different   hopefully wont have the same fate   my hair dries in 15 minutes  my wife loves it  it s so quiet we can talk while she does her hair without her turning off the blow dryer to here what i said  it was a gift my daughter requested  i purchased it for her for her birthday which happens to be on christmas  i received this blow dryer today and it is not an infiniti blow dryer  it is just a regular conair blow dryer  everything i want in a hair dryer   used the same model in a hotel i stayed out and had to have one for myself and one for my daughter  my wife loves it have not use this product as of  to date but the delivery was on time and the packaging is just as pictured  no visual defects or scratches  purchased along with argan oil  i love how well it straightened my hair  my hair feels longer and sleeker  i m sorry i did not purchase this sooner  the hair dryer came to me without the brush attachment  i tried to obtain the brush even if i had br   to pay for it  the seller was  not  helpful at all in me getting the attachment  it came on time  i have not use it yet  but feel it will do what i need    i wanted a comb attachment my wife loves it  she has evev reconended to familes and friend  the item has meat all expectations  thank you this product burned out after about 7 months of once a day  short usage  it is not reliable as this is the second  and last  one i have owned  bought it  lasted a total of four months before it burned out and quit working   had a sunbeam before that worked for 5 years dont buy this maker  after returning to amazon a dryer that claimed to have a low noise level but did not  this one delivered on its promise   also  the diffuser is easier than some to use because you don t have to line up anything to put it on or remove it  it s a simple push on and pull off   have just started using this  so can t speak to its durability  my mom had two of these hairdryers  both of them have shot sparks out the end when i used them purchased this for our trip to europe this year   it worked like a charm and insured that i was not going to blow up another hair dryer on our annual international sojourn  i do not like conair products but my wife insisted to get this since the price is low  it will break  it s just a question of when  i recommend looking at a babyliss  took it to europe  plugged it into 220v  and it started smoking immediately  br    br   it never worked  it obviously is not dual voltage  this hair dryer did not work after 2 weeks  i would not recomend anyone purchasing this hair dryer   no manufacture info on box either  i bought this item for my elderly mother  br   she and others have tried to use it but br   the hose keeps coming detached from the br   bonnet  br   i would not purchase this product again br   or recommend it  this is the third wall mount i have purchased  l ove the convenience and that  i don t have to keep in a drawer  this hair dryer meets all my requirements   it is compact  the cord stays out of the way the unit is reliable  i have bought 3 of these in 5 years  they fall apart one way or another  i will in no way buy a 4th  this does what you think it will  dries hair  my wife likes it and she and her sisters use it all the time  i purchased this blowdryer from amazon and it only lasted 1 year and i only used it every 2   days   junk   don t buy it   the retractable cord did not work after a while too but i could have lived with that    works well for my wife  it s not fancy  but it does the job well  if you re looking for an inexpensive hair dryer  this is the one  my wife used it at a hotel for several days and wanted one for home use   it met and exceeded her expectations i plug it and it doesn t work  just bought it and i never used it before  what do i do with it  es practico y bueno    encantada con el producto desde vargas venezuela br   se los recomiendo   el producto llego en buen estado i looked everywhere for a dryer to meet my needs  this one is just exactily what i needed and wanted  go o oo oo oo oo ooo o ooooo oo oo ooo ooo oo oo  oo oooo ooooo ooooooooooo oooooood excelente todo me llego en tiempo y condiciones esperadas extraordinario servicio sigan asi honestidad  responsabilidad y buen servicio lo mejor de lo mejor i returned this hair dryer because  from the very beginning  the cord didn t retract  and  as some reviewers noted  it did seem surprisingly heavy for a travel hair dryer  es un regalo para mi gorda bella la mas bella que dios me ha regalado en esta vida la amo el articulo llego en perfecto estado y exactamente como lo describi  el vendedor  br   cumplieron con hacer el envio rapido y seguro  br    br   los califico excelente what can i say  i didn t buy this for me bought it for the wife   i haven t used a hair dryer since 1989   she loves this one  2 28 2013 have everything i want   go ooo oo o o o o o o o o o o oo o o d ya lo recib iacute   me gusto el secador muy potente calienta bastante seca r aacute pido y de manera perfecta lo  uacute nico que es un poco pesado  por lo dem aacute s excelente  sorry i don t have anymore to say about it  it does what it s supposed to do  okay  if you want reviews you re going to have to stop limiting the numbers of words  i do wish the cold shot button was colder and the blower was stronger but overall it s nice and when i use it  it does well enough  this is just a regular hairdryer ordered as a second dryer to have on hand in case i need it i have been using it for almost 3 years  i don t have anything negative to say about it  love that it has different speed and heat settings  if anyone complains it is too big or heavy  well  i ve got to say this is not a portable hair dryer  i had similar 1875w revlon before  this one is slightly smaller  the air blow out got the same feeling and speed of heating up  for a hair dryer  it works     i only gave this a 2 star because i have medium to short hair and after 3 4 of an hour it did nt dryit  i would not recomend this  1 10 2013 i received this hair dryer in december of 2012  tried to use it in january of 2013  lifted the hood and a piece snapped off  now my hair dryer hood does not stay in place  i cannot use this item and do not recommend it because it is not durable  this was a christmas gift and was what my daughter asked for  it meets her expectations and was just what she wanted  i was looking for a smaller unit than this and stil i am   the one i got is still to bulky to go in my bags  bueno llego en perfecto estado y funciona muy bien  es de buena potencia y el indicado  para relizar la el secado excelente los tiempos de entrega  la ropa llego en buen estado  buenos vendedores  excelente el producto los recomiendo para futuras compras excelente muy buena calidad es preciosa a mi hija le gusto mucho y soy de venezuela y todo fue rapido i have one in my guest bathroom and my visitors can use it  you dont have to looking one in the lower of the lavatory  yo compre esto para mi hija y le encanto le salva mucho tiempo y dinero cada ves que ella quiere hacerce el pelo the only thing i don t like about it is the dryer cord plugs into the wall   my last wall mounted dryer had a separate power cord from the wall mount   just note this if your mounting the dryer and your electrical outlet isn t close by   otherwise  i would recommend this product  it did not work in europe  every hotel in the us has a hair dryer  why would i carry this with me  however we need it in europe when we travel  garbage  my wife likes the ion and we both like the power  seems to have all the gizmos  deduct one star for fussy buttons  but seems to be well made i can t believe you would send me an appliance that uses 110v  i cannot use this hairdryer as i cannot plug it in  australia has 240v  do you have an adaptor that converts 240v to110v  mi pelo es ondulado y necesita mucho calor para alizarlo   este secador es simplemente perfecto para alizar el cabello  los resultados son como en el beauty salon  definitivamente la mejor invesion que he hecho en mi pelo  vale cada centavo  me encanta   i have to agree with the critics on this one   i used it and even the soft meshy side was too rough on your skin   i bought a package of four i hope i can return three of them   the verdict is still out on the axe shower gel in terms of cleanliness  este secador fue un regalo para mi esposa y le encanto  cumple con las condiciones de un buen secador de cabello  potente  r pido y no da a  lo recomiendo  i bought 2 of these because i thought they were very similar to what i had before   each lasted about 2 uses before i heard something break inside and they would no longer turn on   no matter how low the price do not buy this hair dryer  excelente vendedor  cumplio con los tiempos establecidos y el porducto se llego a su destino en perfectas condiciones  recomendado 100  instead of choosing among the four options  i decided to buy the big pony collection coffret so i could have then all at once    videoid mo24gsvudpbxxj8  hello  this is megan doing a review on this product for you  this product should have come with a warning   even on the low setting  one can get a third degree burn from the heat  i recieved this hair dryer last night and this morning it does not work   the heating element came on   but no air  en realidad todo llego bien y es un muy buen equipo lo recomiendo fue una entrega r pida recomiendo al vendedor este secador es peque o liviano muy ligero es bueno  ojo no es par mi  es para mi esposa y a ella le gusto mucho y mas le gusto porque fue un regalo de mi parte     comprenlo con los hojos serrados this dryer works like it should     the dryer has an ionic on off switch  which was the only reason we bought it  i have had three of these hair dryers  and they last me about two years   i like the convenience of having them on my bathroom wall  i like the three temp  and three levels of air pressure  it makes a big difference i can use it for myself and for my daughter who does not like heat  i purchased ocean potion  45 for my wife  who has been using it for years i love the smell of this and it lathers up perfectly  unfortunately i was allergic to it  if not for that i would use it forever  just what i needed  didn t blow the fuse in my greek apartment like my classmates  dryers  could use an attachment to focus the heat  it does what it supposed to do  don t know what else to say than that  i took this product to my doctor and he said the colon cleanse was the same as a laxative and the acai juice was just a placebo gave them to my granddaughters for easter  they use only hello kitty hairdryers in college avoid this hair dyer   it caught fire only after a couple of months use  they last only about 30 days  only using about 15 mins a day  this is the second one  i will not buy again  it does the job  i could use a bit longer razor  as it is a pretty small head  it s also a lot sharper than i thought it would be  i bought this dryer  but when i recieved it and try it was not as powerful as i thought it would be   then when i wanted to returne it they said they will be 15  restucking fee which sounds really sucks  if i did not open to try it how do i know that is work for me or not i would never ever buy anything frome discount jungle  don t buy it from amazon  it arrived on time buy it had scratches and looked used  the dryer works like a charm and is just what we were looking for  i d recommend it for anyone who doesn t want a hair dryer just lying around on their countertop  the on off switch gets in the way of holding the handle and it often turns off while i am using it  my hair is curly  so i think this dryer is not so stronger for my hair  the retractable cord has already stopped working   probably haven t used the dryer 10 times  it won t stay out  the picture on the web page didn t match the model number  i returned the item and they reimbursed me  i have purchased four jerdon wall mount hair dryers   one for my home and three for our lake house  they are dependable and affordably priced  this item did not work out of the box  i returned it  should be no stars  this dryer conked out after i had it only four months  don t buy it  the on off switch on this dryer needs improvement  i find myself turning the dryer off constantly while using it
