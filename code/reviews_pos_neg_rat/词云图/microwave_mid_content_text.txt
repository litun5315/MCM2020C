quiet  but does not seem like 1000 watt power  it s bigger than i thought  prompt delivery  my microwave is back up and running  works well with proper preparation  got it sooner thank you i wonder if they will ever produce a microwave that only beeps once  received product as described and expeditiously  a     works well  dont buy it    br   the button will be defective after 8 months works well and an an advantage i had not thought of is that the 5 y o can use it with supervision  i am please with this purchase  its the only portable close washer i have purchased so i can t compare products  e spin cycle isn t veryeffective but it washes well  you can put a pair of man size jeans and a couple of tshirts  at one time  i purchased a two year protection plan just in case  uuim6 uk7n fits ikea wall cabinets   came in on time  had no issues came damaged and was returned perhaps its my fault in not researching the low wattage but indeed this microwave takes an exorbitant amount of time to heat items works product does the job it was sold to do  tthe kit works well  it took lots of work to unload and reload the microwave over the range though  we are back up and running  gues what 14 months after buying it happened to me  we will try samsung to morrow if no help everthing called samsung is going to the recycling bin i would have given it five stars if there was a handle on the door to grab on to so that s why i decided to give four stars  does not work will be sending back unit defective upon arrival  could not be repaired after two attempts and numerous phone calls to samsung   not recommended unless you like wasting your time and not having a microwave for a month after purchase  met my needs do not buy this  works as advertised   i like how it doesn t allow finger prints as advertised it works we have had this microwave for 2 months  it makes the scariest noises  like there is metal in it but there is not  the plate also does not spin properly  very low quality  go with a brand you trust  i ve only had it for around 2 months and it s starting to automatically come on when i close the door  the stop button doesn t turn it off  i have to open it and close the door until it shuts off or it automatically turns off  try a different brand  i bought this in august and it shorted out in february   it was nice while it lasted but has a dangerous flaw  do yourself a favor and look elsewhere  i got the product out of the box and it doesn t work  it will do everything but heat up inside  i need to ship it back but between work and school there s no time  i will just ask for my money back  a bit noisy when running and the box and unit was damaged in shipping  though not affecting functioning   holding up well at the moment  item arrived damaged   at that point return of item became a issue  very simple to operate for my grandmother  arrived damaged and needed to use immediately    2 months   no problems  wish i had read reviews on the ge microwaves before purchasing one  totally fried after only 2 years  stay away from over the range ge microwaves  junk do not buy this   you would get better value by throwing money out into the street   mine lasted three weeks  and then became entirely useless   if you buy one of these and pay for it  you will end up with no money and no microwave  not english    i cannot read    works well no problems   as yet  as described stopped working after 3 months   total junk  this item dod not work from the second i opened the nox god model i am satisfy sounds quietly after turning on for one second  it heats well too  microwave works well and there have been no problems  i have a frigidaire microwave model cfmv 164ls  a former version of this model installed in my rv   it quit working after 3 months of use   after weeks of trying to get it replaced under warranty  frigidaire has finally found someone to do the replacement with this model but frigidaire has now refused to pay the service fee for doing the replacement where the unit is located  part is same as picture worked for 1 2 day  works greats  did the job and has held up even after a year of use  it has extended the life on the microwave  it did not work upon arrival as described i received the microwave but it is not working at all  then i need to return it  just wasting my time  did not work so i returned it still learning how to use it  love the form factor  but a bit difficult to read display on time and as described do not buy a samsung microwave   purchased smh1816w january 2013 and in december 2013 stopped working have had 6 service calls and as of april 29 2014 still not working   a e service has replaced all parts multiple times to try to correct problem however with no luck   samsung is unwilling to replace the unit or refund the money paid which would be preferred  i will never purchase a samsung product again  why is it  when i am using the microwave i can t use the fan s highest speed  only 1 and 2  when i press it again the fan s speed goes back to br    1  no problem with all speeds if not using the microwave at the same time  disapointed in the fan suction  doesn t seem to be pulling the air from over the stove  almost like there is a ducting leak  because there is plenty of air blowing  like everyone else our november 2010 purchase has come to be the bane of our kitchen  if you never boil anything on your stove your experience maybe different but if your family requires food to survive i d opt for a different microwave  the microwave is sparking while heating we are sending it back for a replacement will hope it works this time i know i purchased a refurbished unit  but a noticeable dent on the face of it is unacceptable   i m returning this unit  this is the second one of these that has blown up on me in 8 months  i don t recommend it at all  after 16 months the board that controls the keypad died  the repair estimate was twice what i paid for the microwave  repair person told me to get a whirlpool or lg next time  unit arrived looking like a truck had run over it  ordered again thru one of the big box hardware chains and it also arrived beat to heck  they say third time is a charm  we ll see    the microwave was dented when removed from packaging  since the dent was in the back and didn t interfere with installation  i didn t send it back  wouldn t work   have to return it   the word  door  keeps showing up as if there is a problem with the door  br   there is no problem  had this microwave for only 18 month and the door latching spring broke   now i can t close the door  and nothing works  it works
