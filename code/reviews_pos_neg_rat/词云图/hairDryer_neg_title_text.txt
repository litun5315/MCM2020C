bit stronger and a     feels well made  but a little heavy in hand but i was disappointed when i received it because the power cord is     this is the worst hair dryer i have ever bought waste of money the hair dryer itself is great  but the volumizing finger diffuser is terrible cuts down on the frizz  be careful  it s not perfect  we have bought at least 6 of these       disappointed no good  not good   the hair dryer is also heavy and     its pink and brown too weak be wary  lasted just over one year    does the job  but not what i expected  installation was difficult  a small plastic piece cracked during     disappointing for my waves uncomfortably heavy hair feels smoother and moisturized  but dries no faster and the dryer is heavy no cool shot horrible not good for kinky natural

i am very disappointed  awkward grip on handle  it kinda bugs my finger     dries nicely  not too loud bought this for my wife once her previous  different brand      high hopes with poor results no better than the rest  would not recommend using for long period of time poor what a disappointment  too bad conair is diluting their brand with this junk is that the concentrator piece on the end of the hairdryer comes off every now and then and it can become very annoying  dynamite little dryer average blow dryer very disappointed  waste of money does not blow hard enough for me  worst hair dryer ever not happy with this hair dryer     heat selector buttons are not toggle or rocker switch like other ones it seems to wobble when operated and     not exactly useful awful  puff of smoke and no blowing  not safe for use in the u s  why is this item getting such bad reviews  dry s well and is small enough to pack for travel     very disappointed     doesn t last long     this on the recommendation of my stylist and i hate it  the hot setting is too hot and     horrible heavy    hard to believe but works as promised     iffy after i ordered this product with all the horrible things that were said about it not what i expected  average  lasted a few months  pink powerhouse  sorry piece of equipment  trouble with the heat tight bonnet weak air flow  but silky hair  another typical hairdryer heavy  since my hair is too thin  it dries it     i would recommend buying a few levels up as i have had     absolutely not the hair dryer for you if you have small hands or arthritis wasn t what i expected  thought it would have been     frizzy mess piece of crap bad temperature and flow control piece of crap  a must have for foreign travel the voltage switch was broken    could not     disappointing definetely this hair dryer sucks  it did not last not even 30 days it makes me a little nervous bc i have long hair and i am scared that it will get sucked into the backside of the dryer not great hair dryer stopped working after only a few months not worth the money  they shortened the cord to save a few pennies    not happy  loud and weak missing item horrible no more clunky dryer flawed the most awful hair dryer ever  very heavy and     dangerous   don t go near this worthless product  bs thumbs down  so pissed weak disappointment very unhappy with this dryer  i wanted to return     i hate blow drying my hair not a good choice for me the diffuser is crap and the fan speed and heat settings are way     i agree with the other comments  i love how

later after install  but i like  that it has a cold setting sparks shooting out of cord  very dangerous  i ve been using this for the past 3  almost     switch failed poor quality for the price works as expected small diffuser   does not work well on curly hair  not worth it  do not buy  poor quality burned out in less than 6 uses    the dryer itself was just fine  just that damn clear coating paint looked awful     not good  couldn t remain its heat  i wanted one that blows hard and i could control     disappointing  i what a waste of money not good i hate this dryer very disappointed  i

average blow dryer i use it every day     not for thick hair cord is too stiff  i would have expected the     not comfortable to sit under timer knob broke in less than 6 months  i guess sometimes you do get what you pay for   in a bad way  i have coarse thick hair   but not when i dry hair dryer is not genuine   it s fake  bogus  counterfeit  garbage  junk not authentic do not buy  no power  combs and brushes were not right for     not powerful  broken  works for small jobs frustrated with connector it s like a giant robotic arm it dries the hair in half the time    the on off switch is broken

carefully disappointed don t waste your money  expensive and not sure it s worth it buttons are flimsy and odd not happy that i spent  40 short fingers on a round diffuser are hard to find  not much power disappointed with shipment the adapter with the spikes was horrible  it was very hard and hurt my head small   lightweight  this product is crap  i should have read the reviews lots of power for little size   horrible defective product dangerous because sucks in hair you don t have to waste space in your drawer too little power don t waste your money on this very disappointment  i should have read the reviewer before i     dries my hair in the half the time of any     i ve used this for a few years now  and     waste of money have had this less than a year and it s started     worst hair dryer i have ever bought horrible experience  designed by people who hate hair and like vaccums poorly designed not worth the money i have thick  thick hair  i have envied     i am disappointed  not

by and it died this cord is really long and a bit tough to manage  the dryer is the worst one i ever had it started falling apart on     a little wonky to hold disappointing burnt out after a few months disappointing purchase died in less than 1 year little dynamo and the worst that happened was a burn hole in the hotel     shop no more waste of money   no dryer for my trip         for a couple of years and the plug went bad  so i tried replacing it with several different     worst hairdryer ever junk don t waste your money small  simple  does the job  item came missing the connecting screw  still waiting for     worst hair dryer does not dry hair awful dies after a few months disappointed i have relatively thin hair and this took forever to     the cord hiding in the hair dryer seems like a waste   i prefer the lighter model i am disappointed at the overall quality as i feel it should     too weak for my thick hair always like conair brand but this one is very annoying and maybe has a defect  for me this hairdryer is a little heavy and takes     dont expect it to last much past the warrantee    no cool button  the packaging was torn and taped back     too heavy don t waste your        conair   amazon should be ashamed to sell this product not good for medium to long hair  mediocre pretty disappointing since the retractable cord is the reason i     disappointed not too bad  game changer  the concentration attachment falls off repeatedly  and i mean     it performes as expected  my problem with it is     thought it would be cooler like it was on my previous hair dryer awful broken timer knobs frizzy and dull  poor disappointing stopped working after a few uses strong motor  but bad design i ve never bought a bad hair dryer  used to hate drying my hair    very disappointed  lots quieter than previous units  piece of crap not a good product poor quality poor quality big hype average dryer dangerous  weak broken within a year not much power so convenient for me to do other things while drying my hair without having to lug one of the self standing ones around keep looking  not worth your money  disappointment i threw away all my other dryers the worst choice works well but sucks your hair in the back  finish on handle and base cracks but not soon enough to return not hot enough heavy duty  it s small no more tangled cords  way too big and too heavy

functioning retractable cord used for less than 4 months 3 months  use and now it s dead just what i expected not what i expected dry your hair    do not buy   the 5 star reviews are fake lots of wind and little heat mediocre rating heavy a little heavy frizzy hair no more  flawed design missing a button  but i didn t need it after all dual voltage fail hard to use most annoying dryer i ve ever had  everything expected dirty and broken not a good dryer too heavy it does harm to long hair  heavy advice for other ladies too expensive to break so soon air flow not powerful not worth it pointless broke in less than 8 month expensive hair dryer but well worth it  not a good buy works well but very heavy and awkward to use  not a good buy not easy to style hair with one hand expensive  but worth it  missing some controls 3 temperatures and less noise don t waste your money   peace out  expensive dryers don t waste your money and put holes in your wall bit bigger than expected it does dry hair
