works great  this dries my hair faster that bigger  more powerful models  i love travel blow dryers because they are easy to lift and they usually come in 1600 w or less  bigger dryers are heavy and blow my hair everywhere  this has a surprising amount of power and is very compact  i would give it a five except that the switch is not easy to turn on and off with one hand and it s noisier than i anticipated  love this dryer  i just got this last week  i think s great  the cord length is perfect  excellent dryer  i found everything goes well except the plug  why the left and right is opposite and i have to put the plug upside down for charging    another flaw is the big noise  perfect got tho on super sale  love it  cuts my drying time in half reckon i have had this about a year now  at least 7 months  works great  i use it 5 days a week  blows hot air  doesnt overheat  isnt to big  came quick  didnt cost much  get you one  you will like it  nice hair dryer  dual voltage comes in handy  great product    took me anywhere between 30 40 mins to blow dry my clients hair with my old blow drier     with this new one its cut the time in half    it s has lots of power    great deal    n it s super cute      update  7 8 months later it only blows cold air  i wouldn t recommend this drier for the price they are selling it now  it s rubbish this is a good dryer with nice attachments   very light and powerful  the only drawback is the switches  if your hand has any mousse or oil on them  forget turning this on without a struggle  the switches have no grip nor heavy grooves on them that make turning on off easy  but  overall good  live this hairdryer perfect for travel  thanks so handy  works great  frees up counter top space in my small bathroom  after using the same blowdryer for probably 8 10years  i decided to upgrade to a new one  i have very thick   very thick    moderately wavy shoulder length hair  due to my hair thickness  drying times were typically 30 45minutes  i wish i was joking  this dryer dries completely in under 15 minutes  about 10 12minutes more precisely   i am so thrilled with this dryer   can t say enough good things about it  i like the texture of the dryer itself  love the speed of drying and the cord is long enough to actually be able to use it  score  works great   just wish it had a medium setting  i blowdry my hair at least 3 times a week and i was using a really  really old  cheap  bulky one to get the job done  this dryer gets the job done a lot better  it s smaller  lighter  more ergonomic if you will  and dries my long  thick hair  not always a good thing   reasonably quick  great purchase  as long as it lasts as long as my old ones did    love this  keeps my curls nice and not frizzes out  this is a really nice hair dryer from remington  the handle and controls  are very ergonomic  and the head is well balanced so that it doesn t get to be a chore handling it  the heat settings are what you d expect  and the dryer does a good job of getting your hair dry fast without too much static buildup  what i really like about this dryer is the generous cord length and the ability to hand the dryer from a hook  the attachments fit well  but the diffuser attachment comes in the handiest as always  great blowdryer  it gets the job done  the only thing i dislike is how it is not compatible with universal comb attachments  also as i blowdry my hair the attachment keeps falling off amazing amount of air that comes out of it  my wife and i love it    my waiting time to go out is cut in more than half   highly recommended  feels solid like you are getting your money s worth  has a nice long cord too   so far  an excellent hair dryer  not too noisy  good controls  the handle is well contoured  my only nit is that the little plastic attachment that directs the stream of warm or hot air pops off a little too easily  this item it s been working perfectly fine  i m glad i ordered   it is so hard to find a small blowdryer  i m very happy with this  perfect great dryer  looks exactly as in photo  light weight and works like a charm  would definitely recommend small and strong   great dryer for travel   also has dual voltage   glad i bought it  not as good as the original conair 1875  makeovers and upgrades don t always yield the best results  for instance  this 1875 replica  lacks the basic functions a blow dryer should have  such as temperature adjustment  there is only a setting for high and low fan speed  also  in order to use the air only feature with no heat  the cooling button has to be pressed and held down to use this basic function  this causes a person s fingers to get tired  holding a button over using a sliding switch  then there is the retracted cord that is missing  that was probably the most valuable feature for the original conair 1875  made the dryer much more portable  even useful when not traveling  now the new 1875 has its cord sprawled all over the bathroom counter  the original is much better  this is slightly smaller with about 10 watts more power and a directional air controller  but overall not worth the investment  seems to be working well  was easy to mount on the wall  i have just used it once  but it worked great  dried my hair in about 15 minutes  compact yet powerful  easy to pack and travel with  excellent value for the price  much better blow dryers are available  but for the price this more than satisfied my needs  powerful  lots of fan settings  cold air button  and best of all  a retractable cord  i like the folding handle for traveling  too great product  i can blow my hair dry and blow out of here for a quick appointment  so far  so good     very powerful  dries my hair quickly  this is a very nice hair blow dryer   the color is a lovely medium shade of pink that is in a matte tone versus a plastic looking shiny one   the dryer comes with a diffuser which works well for my curly hair   it has an unusual type of soft touch finish   it doesn t feel slippery at all   it fits well in the hand and the finish seems to be it fit a little more snug that others i have had before  br    br   the air filter is removable and be sure to clean it about once a week   i destroyed a blow dryer by not cleaning the filter   it overheats the motor and kills it pretty quickly   along with the diffuser  there is a very narrow concentrator attachment which works really well if you need to put heat on a precise spot   there are three heat settings and two speeds   there is also a cool shot button for getting the air cool quickly as you are styling  br    br   the interesting thing about this blow dryer  apart from the finish  is that it is much quieter than others i have had   my first thought was that it meant that it wasn t as powerful but that is not the case   it works well and is not as loud  product is just as described  super fast delivery it s a good hair dryer for the price   i do find that it smells like it s burning on high hot  i use it on warm and low so it s just fine for my needs  br   i tried a salonsalon hair dryer at a friends house which was fabulous   turns out it costs  169   way out of my budget  this one will probably last a year and then i ll probably buy another sassoon tourmaline ceramic   helps keep the fly aways from flying away  this is a great hair dryer with loads of power   it feels like a salon dryer  cute and stylish not as hot and powerful as i expected and somehow it does not deliver any kind of expected shining usually produced by professional ceramic dryers    this product arrived in an open box  the cord was pushed into the box  looked as if it had been returned  but it arrived quickly and it works  small easy to travel with  i m not one to write reviews but i thought i d do it for this product  i have fine  curly hair but lots of it  it was taking me a good 25 minutes to blow dry my hair every other day and i was getting tired of it  i felt like i d tried about every hair dryer  affordable  in the store  i decided i d try an expensive salon one to see if that d do the trick  so i splurged and bought the buttercup dry bar hair dryer  it worked well but only cut my drying time down about 5 minutes and in all honesty  i didn t think it was worth the  200  i came across the john frieda hair dryer and read some good reviews so decided i d give it a shot  plus it was much more affordable than the dry bar  well  i loved it  it only took me 11 minutes to blow dry this mane of mine plus it gave it extra shine and my ends don t look so dry  it also straightened out my hair better than any other hair dryer i ve had which cut down my flat iron time  as well  the only cons are that the buttons are placed in an odd location and it has a weird hum but you get used to that real quick  so it didn t really bother me all that much  but i would definitely recommend this product  i am giving this hair dryer 5 stars for being so amazingly simple  br   there are no frills or cool settings  low  high  cool  just basic user friendly hair drying action  br   can i tell you this thing lasts  i ve had mine for about 7 years now and works like the day i got it  br   just do yourself a favor and unscrew the back every now and then and clean the lint out of the filter  wire mesh on back  i bought this for my girl to keep her from buying another walmart bargain  i can tell it s quieter than most and she says it dries her hair faster  nice lightweight unit  ergonomically designed  the cleanable filter on the back is a nice feature  bang for the buck very good  good quality i ve owned like 3 or 4 blow driers in my time  i m not so good about consistently using them because i m lazy  well  i also know how harsh blow drying can be on hair  particularly colored like mine   so i tend to avoid it  but every so often  more so in the winter   i find i need to dry my hair quickly instead of waiting  my last hair dryer died in a blaze of glory   well  actually it more or less fizzled and refused to turn on  so when this popped up in my vine selection  i selected it  br    br   this remington hair dryer comes with attachments   one  a diffuser  that looks like an alien product  apparently used for curly hair   and a funnel appendage that reminds me of an airplane wind tunnel  i don t have curly hair so i didn t bother with the diffuser  i really wish it had not been included because all it does it take up valuable drawer space   but i did test out the wind tunnel  much as i like pretending it s a wind tunnel for miniature airplanes  i would like to know  what is this thing called really    br    br   i love all the settings  my last hair dryer pretty much had hi lo  hot cold and that was it  this has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds along with a cold blast setting  allowing for a more controlled drying experience  i found it really dried my thick  wavy hair well  another reason why i hate drying my hair   it usually takes 30 minutes for it to be all dry  and relatively quickly  the wind tunnel also helped to ensure nice  smooth  straight hair   the way i like to style my hair  br    br   overall  i m impressed and pleased  i wish that the diffuser hadn t been included because i have no need for it and the space it takes up but i know that those with curly hair may appreciate it  br    br   update 09 18 16  while i still like this product  i have since received a bio ionic from vine  which i like more  the remington s cool burst is far too easily activated when i am drying my hair  a problem i don t have with the bio ionic  therefore  i am taking away 1 star to show this  br    br   brought to you by  br    c s  light y   c s  light  less heat and more blow would be better great hairdryer  affordable price  delivery was quick  like the packaging and the extra hair drying tips you get by email  wishing it had a little bit more power in the cool blast but no big deal  im pleased that i bought this product to replace my old hairdryer which took 20mins to dry my hair  happy to say it has cut the timing of drying my long hair down to 8minutes and leaves my hair smooth enough not to use the ghd hair irons  only major downside is that it is quite noisy  i love this hair dryer  the available speeds and temperatures are perfect and it s the most quiet hair dryer i ve ever owned   the only drawback for me is the placement of the on off switch  it s located at the very bottom of the handle so i have to use two hands to turn it on or off   a better design would be to reverse the placement of the buttons so it could be turned on off easily with my thumb  currently  the speed temperature button is easily reached with my thumb  but i don t change that very often   that is the only reason i didn t give it five stars   nevertheless  i still highly recommend it and would buy it again  this dryer is exactly what i wanted very lightweight and does the job this is the best dryer i have ever used  it isn t all that quiet  and though it s not really heavy  it is bigger than i m used to and so still a bit unwieldy in my unpracticed hands  but it dries my thick  coarse  shoulder length hair faster than any other device i have ever used  it also leaves my hair notably silkier and more manageable than other dryers  the allure would seem to offer the benefits of an expensive professional tool at a surprisingly reasonable price  hoping it holds up over time  and planning to purchase another to keep at my summer cottage  my wife is very happy with this hair dryer and she has very full  thick hair  so far so good blow holes are only at the top would be great if they were at the sides good as expected this is my third hot tools bonnet dryer in 25 years  i love it  highly recommend it  i  too had the bonnet constantly unhooking from the hose but realized after the second dryer that the bonnet has a notch inside the ring that clicks to keep the connected to the bonnet  the dryer does get very but with 4 heist settings i keep lower it after 10 15 minutes then every five  nice quality  fairly quiet  nice looking and not too big   i bought two  very much worth it  i was hoping for a quieter blow dryer  this is definitely quieter than my other dryer  but still not quiet  i also read all kinds of reviews that said this dries your hair so it s smooth and silky  the only thing that makes my hair smooth and silky is product  have had it for about 4 years and thought it did a good enough job   i use it on  medium heat blow settings and always clean the air intake screen at the first sign of lint   however  it has recently been throwing out sparks and some actual flames   at first it was a high pitched screeching noise  then popping  then sparks  now flames   it is in the trash and i will be looking for a better dryer   funny that my mother has had the same dryer for over 15 years  but this modern   34 high tech  34  stuff is just mass produced junk  best blow dryer i have purchased in a long time i love how compact it is and how amazing it works    this is a great dryer for the price  i haven t noticed my strands being shiny or silky   but the dryer dries quickly and isn t very loud   i appreciate the different heat and speed settings  the barrel is longer than most other dryers i ve used but it isn t hard to grip or control  it is boxed nicely and comes with a diffuser attachment  i would recommend this productif you check out the pictures in other s reviews you ll see they have had luck with smooth  shiny hair  i have not gotten a chance to use it that much to see results and i ve been using texturing product which also isn t conducive to smooth or shiny hair  good experience will order again great blow dryer      great for the price   glad i didn t spend hundreds like i ve seen on others   love it   i enjoyed using this at the beginning   after few months of use  it gets over hot easily and i have to stop and wait until it cools down  my purchase of the hot tools tourmaline ionic standing hair dryer was a great investment  i love the purple and black color  it has two heat settings  high and low  two speed settings  high and low  and it has an on off ionic knob  it has an adjustable pole which is great when you have more than one person using it  it also has wheels so it is easy for me to roll it around the house  this is much better that the hooded dryer that i had to sit on the table and find a chair low enough so i could fit under the hood  i use my dryer on a weekly basis  the hood is very roomy and has a flip up front  i can dry my hair with large rollers with no problem  now i can get the salon feel of the hair dryer at home  best one this had terrible reviews but it was the only one i could find with the 3 things i wanted  diffuser  retractable cord  and folding handle  i figured for the price it was with a try  i m so glad i did because i love it  i don t understand the negative reviews  it dries my hair quickly and my very curly hair looks great  we have just gotten rid of all the hair dryers in the house to try some new ones  the last ones should have been thrown out years ago  and this one works great  my wife and daughter have very kinky curl hair and it takes time to dry their hair but this product cuts that time in half which is great  very strong firm hair dryer that feels high end upon picking it up although very affordable looking at the price   my daughter has taken over this one in her bathroom  she loves the color purple  so we have let her take possession of this one  br    br   great hair dryer that you would expect to see at a high end salon  absolutely the best hair dryer i ve ever owned hands down     i love this dryer so freakin fast it s amazing  came in less than a weeks time  very pleased  so far so good  over heated in 2 minute  we had to return it and had to pay bubble rap to sent it back to amazon  good luck if you want to order this through online  nice quality  it works great and i haven t had any issues at all  works great   love it  so far so good nice quality  works just fine   no problems  excellent  hair dryer this is one of the best hair dryer you will probably ever find  it is very powerful and dries my hair quite quickly  plus the folding design makes it easy to stash away  in addition  it s relatively small so it s not taking up a ton of room in your suitcase  a win all around  holy cow   maybe it s because my old dryer died 6 weeks ago and i haven t blow dried since  what can i say   it s hot and i m too lazy to fancy up in the summer  but wow this thing works fast   it s cute  it s small  but it packs a punch  the dryer itself was really nice but the packaging could have been better  cool speed is perfect for my hair   no frizz or dryness it s good  i like 3 level of heat  great blow dryer  just a little more heavy than i expected i love my hot pink mini pro  so lightweight and powerful   the super cute tote bag is a plus   perfect for travel but i use mine everyday   i didn t think it would be as good as my big  clunky  heavy dryer  but this little baby gets hot  has a lower setting also   i have shoulder  hand issues and now they don t hurt when i blow dry my hair   love it   good hair dryer  it can make your hair more straight but its kinda heavy compared to other hair dryers  excellent product  this was a great hair dryer    for 8 months   yesterday the heating element stopped working and now it only blows cool air   i thought since it was a revlon product and it wasn t cheap that it would last for years   i was wrong    i bought this for my sister for her to use it for college  it came really fast  she loves it and it s very affordable  thank you     excellent hair dryer with some good features   some of these features seem to be from a marketer s mind rather than real   it won t fix damaged hair   whatever that means   it won t make your hair shinier  healthier  or improve your already good looks   however  in real world day to day use it is very capable and effective at drying and styling  br    br   it feels solid and well built without being too hefty   it has very solid cord connectors and circuit breaker protection built into the plug   excellent safety features   the handle and controls are very well placed for ease of use   they stay cool to the touch during use   it has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings   low speed and low heat works best for us  it puts out a huge amount of hot air at high heat and high speed   it has a cool air blow feature which is good for finishing the drying process   it has a couple of attachments  a concentrator and diffuser  which you may find useful   it definitely is not portable though it is transportable if weight is not an issue  br    br   hair dryers are a commodity and there are a lot of choices   this unit stands out in a crowded field and should work for almost all hair drying and styling situations and requirements  i just love it love how light it is and how quickly it dries my hair  from ms  s1rude  br   i ve been using an older model remington hairdryer for years  so i was able to compare this model to an another model of the same brand  br   i don t have a model number on my current hairdryer because all of the writing has been rubbed off  but it has a single switch to select hi low warm speeds or cool mode  the ac2015c has two switches  one allows you to select between three temperatures  the other between two speeds  there is a   34 cool shot  34  button  i have fine  straight shoulder length hair and don t really use my dryer for anything other than drying  so i ve never understood the purpose of a cool shot button  were i to use this function  i prefer my existing drying because you can set it to cool mode with the switch  while the new model requires you to hold the button down continuously for cool air  the ac2015c is more than twice as heavy as and slightly larger than my existing dryer  which i didn t care for  pros of the ac2015c are that it is a nice looking dryer  and if its anything like my old remington  it will probably last forever  for now i m planning to stick with old reliable  its lighter and more straightforward  works great   just what i wanted    love love love it  best one yet  my boyfriend uses this more than i do   he seems to enjoy it  i use it on my curly air   works great  cons  i took a star away because this is very heavy in hand and awkwardly balanced  and that is without adding the removable tip   the pros  it came impressively beautifully packaged  it looks beautiful  feels well made  it has a lot of drying power  and is not too loud  awesome dryer  i was on the fence for a while but now i m addicted  leaves my fine  fizzy  dry hair soft and smooth and my hair just keeps getting healthier  if you are waiting  don t   you just have to try this once and you will be sold  i bought this hair blower cause i lost the back of my other blow dryer i must say this has been my favorite blow dryer i have really curly hair and this blow dryer does the job it s very hot so i don t have to spend to much time on one piece of hair every time i do my hair i feel like i just came out the salon i just love it  it stays true to it s name as it is indeed mini  and i wouldn t buy this if i have thicker hair  this was for 3 months the best investment yet for my hair  i have used a cheaper hair dryer forever  but this was worth every penny  however it broke and will not shoot out and warm it hot air  most disappointing product yet in amazon i have bought because it worked for awhile so well  i have to purchase a new hair dryer   unfortunately it won t be this one again  as a woman who takes pride in her hair i need something more reliable and safe  great hair dryer   love having the hair dryer ready to use but out of the way mounted to the wall   we have one in each bathroom  love this hair dryer   it s louder than i m used to but my hair seems smoother  my wife loves this thing  she said it feels like a real saloon  love this hair dryer  best dryer i have ever owned  i used this blow dryer for 4 years until it randomly broke one day but it always gave my hair a silky  smooth  and shiny finish  i have straight hair   i would say the noise level is average  not too loud but not whisper quiet either  it has all the heat and speed settings you could need for a blow out and the retractable cord is the best feature because it prevents a dreaded tangled mess  very nice hair dryer and good price too  good  dryer works great but be careful with cord  last one the cord worked free from dryer and it was shooting sparks out of cord  quite  compact  seems  very  sturdy  high  setting  very  strong  but  quite  loud works great shipment takes a bit long but very good product this is a nice blow dryer for the price  and it is more lightweight than my trusty revlon helen of troy model that s still ticking even after numerous drops on my bathroom floor  br    br   like the numerous dial settings  but this dryer does not that hot   but maybe that s to be expected because this is a   34 damage control  34  blow dryer  and heat   along with chemicals like peroxide and ammonia   is one of your hair s biggest enemies   have always dried my hair on the lowest heat and speed settings  and the cool shot should be highly distinguishable from a warm setting   on this hair dryer  you can barely tell them apart   all heat settings feel relatively the same  br    br   the verdict is that  using this dryer  it took a longer time to dry my thick hair   however  my hair did come out nice and shiny  woks good conair always makes good products great size and has adequate power    i really wanted to love this dryer as it comes highly recommended by professional stylists   i used it twice  it dried my hair quickly and somewhat smooth using a ceramic ion brush   i was pleased with the results  after all this was a big step up from the half broken one i purchased from sally s years ago   then i visited my mother who recently purchased a new drier  the rusk w8less   she told me i should try it   when i used the rusk i was amazed at how fast it dried my hair and how  smooth and silky my hair felt   i was in love    it was a huge step up from the twinturbo   i had to have the rusk  so i returned the twinturbo   i could not be happier w the customer service   refund was super smooth   so for the drier 3 stars customer service via amazon and the seller 5 stars  br    br   pros   dries fast  smooth results  nice button position  br    br   cons  heavy  the wind screen on the back has no cover  just flimsy screen  on both occasions i used the drier my long hair was sucked into the screen  causing it to tangle and burn   in my opinion this is a design flaw  the hole in the back of the dryer is the circumference of my fist  br    br   look to the rusk w8less   it s an outstanding dryer  the wire mesh over the vacuum in the back wasn t even attached  i had to super glue it down so the blow dryer wouldn t suck hair into the back of it  it s nice  i thought the cool shot had a locking button  but it doesn t  that was the main reason i bought it  it does work well and it doesn t seem to over heat like me other one  i just really like this hairdryer   in fact  i purchased this item to replace the exact same hairdryer  which i had for probably about five years before it finally fizzled out   it s comfortable to hold  it dries my long  thick hair quickly  no easy feat   and leaves my hair smooth and shiny   i initially replaced my old hairdryer with a different  more expensive  ionic hairdryer  and didn t get the same results   so i looked for an exact replacement on amazon  and was pleasantly surprised to find it  not to mention at such a good price   needless to say  i didn t hesitate to click the   34 buy now with 1 click  34  button  and i m glad that i did  br    br   pros  br   tourmaline ceramic technology   emits infrared heat and negative ions  which makes it gentler on hair and faster drying br   lightweight  comfortable to hold and use br   long cord br   foldable   packs and stores easily and compactly br    br   cons  br   doesn t have separate heat and speed settings br   the on off switch is a little difficult to use br   doesn t have a retractable cord i m on the road vacationing and brought this dryer with me  i have very long hair and swim a lot in chlorinated pools  that means a ton of showers and wet hair  this dryer works great for me  it is quiet  efficient and really dries my hair quickly  it sn t so hot that it burns my fine hair  the bonus is that i get a smooth textured outcome that air drying just doesn t give me  br    br   on the aesthetic side i love the textured feel to this dryer s exterior  it has a silky matte finish that i very much enjoy  lovely color as well  my hairdryer was noisy and past its prime  so i was delighted to try this new remington dryer  it s sleek and it s quiet  it s a bit heavier than my old conair  but not so heavy as to be uncomfortable to hold  in fact  it has a very nice  slim grip and i like the matte finish  my hair is indeed shinier  as promised  an unexpected extra is that it stays straighter  a real bonus in heat and humidity  i may never use the attachments  diffuser and focused stream  but it s nice to have them  i m enjoying my new dryer and look forward to a long relationship  i love it this dryer is prefect for my daughters and i   this is a great hair dryer at a fantastic price   it contains all the elements i have in my older and much more expensive hair dryer   it uses ionic ceramic toumaline to help reduce frizz and static that occurs from blow drying your hair   it has three heat settings and two blower speeds   i generally use the medium heat and the high blower  but i like to have the option to do a quicker dry with high heat when needed   it also includes the cool shot button which allows you to quickly cool the dryer down in the midst of drying and styling  br    br   it has an easily removable filter  which is a huge plus   i once ruined a dryer because i didn t realize i needed to clean the filter   now i periodically take the filter off and blow the   34 wrong way  34  through it to clear dust that accumulates through time   i do this about one a week or so and it helps keep the dryer running well and from burning out   i have placed a towel hook next to my bathroom sink and i hang the dryer on it   it keeps it off the counter  saving room and keeping it within easy reach  br    br   the dryer comes with both a concentrator for when you are styling your hair or trying to focus the drying effort as well as a diffuser  the latter is important for me as my hair has a lot of wave and curl and blow drying it without the diffuser turns it all to frizz instead of curls  br    br   i m very pleased with this dryer and recommend it as a good and fairly inexpensive choice  i already have the d3190a  which is a lot like this ac215c that i selected for my daughter because she likes this color better than the purple  br   they both have the   34 cool shot feature  34  which we love  and the cleanable filter   very important feature to keep airflow going strong  which is key to its ability to dry hair quickly  you would think all hair dryers would have it  br    br   now to its features  it has the three heat settings   two power settings   i wish it had 3 power settings   br   it has a concentrator and a diffuser which my daughter who has a head full of natural curls says it is an essential attachment to have if you have curls like her  br   it also has the   34 ionic  heat protection  technology  34  that keeps your hair free from frizz   fly aways  it dries hair fast we both have long hair   it doesn t tangle it all up when blow drying on high  br    br     all of this is just like the purple d3190a model  where it differs is that this one has a br   four year warranty as opposed to the d3190a  which only has a 2 yr warranty and they say it has a salon quality ac motor for 4 times a longer life br   so  that explains the longer warranty  for  10 00 more you get a better value as this is supposed to last twice as long as the purple d3190a one that is  20 00 br   they both function excellently  if money is tight get the purple d3190a one  if you have the extra  10 i would go with this one  this is a very good blow dryer  it has three heat and two speed settings  and a cool shot button to help set your style  it s 1875 watts  so it s nice and strong though not as powerful my professional hair dryer that does dry my hair faster  but my hair has been getting split ends and damaged  so i love that this dryer is designed to protect against heat damage  only time will tell if that feature works  but i sure need it  this also has the usual attachments that i never use but they look the same as what typically comes with a blow dryer  my biggest problem with blow dryers is the motor dies from not regularly cleaning the lint filter  which draws in dust and causes the motor to overheat   so one great feature is this remington has a removable filter for easy cleaning  and that will definitely prolong the life of the hair dryer if the filter is cleaned out regularly  br    br   my hair comes out smooth and nice with the remington  my favorite part about the design is it s comfortable to hold  the controls are placed well for comfortable use and most of all it s super lightweight  also  this dryer is not as loud as most others  it looks great in purple too  i do wish the cord was a little longer  it s long enough for plugging into a high outlet in a bathroom  but if i need to use a lower outlet in another room  then the cord is too short for me to stand and dry my hair  though adequate if i sit down   i m used to a longer cord  so others may not mind the cord length  but i m taking one star off as i think the cord should be at least a foot longer  overall  however  i definitely recommend this hair dryer as it has great features  works very well and is such a great value  worked great for about 6 months  then simply would no longer turn on  great quality  let me start with the removable filter which allows you to  clean the dust out  my previous dryers did not have this option and the filter would clog diminishing the airflow and the drying ability  that is why this is such an important feature to me you would think all hair dryers would have it  br   now to its features  it has 3 heat settings and 2 power settings   wish there were 3   br    annnd a   34 cool shot  34  which iove  love  love  i have very thin  fine hair and when i set my hair with heat rollers i use the   34 cool shot  34  feature to speed up the   34 set  34  and my curls stay in longer as the hair is more cooled down before i take the rollers out so the curls don t fall out as quickly as they used to  my set lasts longer  br   i use the concentrator but have no need for the diffuser but if you are naturally curly it is a nice attachment to have  br   it has the heat protection   34 ionic technology  34  that helps keep your hair frizz and fly away free  dries hair fast  i have long hair  and doesn t tangle it up when just doing a blow dry and not setting my curls  br   it has a 2 year warranty and is at a great price for what you get  i would recommend this dryer  love it  just did not get any papers to register warrantee on this product  it s a bit heavy but i love it  i have curly  frizzy hair and it has helped control it  the price it great too  i can t compare it to a   34 high end  34  dryer but within this price range it s  1  good  needed a new dryer and have been shopping around for a while   i ve looked at this one online a few times but couldn t justify the price   then it  went on sale and i jumped on it   just got it  first use   it s not silver  like the one pictured  but i didn t buy it for color so i don t care  mine is kind of a gunmetal black    beautifully packaged  easy to understand directions  switches  and they should be  i m drying my hair  not launching a rocket into space    a bit heavier than my last dryer  but not uncomfortable   i did notice a really mild chemical odor  but i was using the dryer on its highest setting and i m guessing it had to do with the casing heating up   the odor did go away and it was never overpowering and didn t make me think the dryer was going to explode in my hand or anything   the dryer did not dry my thick  mid back length hair in 5 minutes  as was claimed by another reviewer  i think  but it did significantly decrease my drying time   took about 22 minutes down from 40 50  and would still have damp spots   and that was with a little extra time fiddling around styling because     my hair looks awesome   seriously   i could be in a hair products commercial right now  i m not kidding   i feel like my gorgeous hair is going to waste just sitting inside writing an amazon review  but this baby deserves it so i sat right down to do it   i would have never believed a dryer would make so much difference  otherwise i d have bought this ages ago   but truly  i look like i just walked out of the salon   i want to stockpile these so i never have to live without it   this was a phenomenal deal on sale  but i would pay full price  and then some  knowing what i know now  loved    my hair is dry in less than 5 minutes  the best  i never realized that spending a little more on a hairdryer could be so worth it  cut my drying time in half  i ve just never even thought of ordering a higher end hair dryer  glad i finally wised up  not as strong as the older built unit with same stock    name  and specs  love it  finally a hairdryer that has powerful air  just the right heat settings  and doesn t break the bank  three heat settings that feel like they should  cold  warm  hot  two speed settings  high and low  very happy with the ease of selecting what i want  plus  again  the great air flow  br    br   a major plus is not having the high pitch screeching whine of a conair or so many other brands  for such power  the allure 2200w is a relatively quiet dryer  on a noise scale of 10  i would venture to say between   34 4  34  and   34 6   34  depending on the settings  for comparison  i would rate most conairs and probably most other blow dryers i ve used at between 7 10  not dis ing conair  just mostly been using that brand for the past decade  br    br   my only wish is that the allure buttons were on the right side  as opposed to facing inside toward your head   as i find the buttons a tad easy to inadvertently press  but that s a personal preference  maybe you ll like it just the way it is  on the other hand  if you have both left  and right handed family members  this might be a good solution  br    br   either way  i personally love this dryer  five stars  i used one of these in a hotel while on vacation and liked it so much i came home and ordered one   it works so much faster than my older one  great blowdryer for the price that gets the job done  however  the   34 high  34  setting is noisier than i would have liked  good      professional grade in my home   great hair dryer for the price  i got this because my old hairdryer was starting to get beat   i was really surprised at how quickly my hair dried using it   i have long hair which usually takes a while to dry and literally it took just a few minutes to get it dry   really surprising   and it wasnt superhot either   i also had more shine  again a surprise   i dont know how a dryer can shine your hair but it does   i didnt expect the claims on the box to really be true  particularyl at this dryers price   a great deal  i normally do not use a hair dryer but my office now has a gym  after working out i don t want my very long hair dripping all over the place  my hair is straight so i do not need the diffuser attachments that came with this dryer  i was surprised at how quiet this hair dryer is and how much volume of warming air it generates  my hair was dry in minutes  this dryer is light and very efficient  i love the color  very impressive addition to my hair care regime  bought this to take on a trip to europe   i love how it folds and how it is easy to convert the voltage   most importantly  this small dryer works really well   great purchase    buy it  light and powerful   great for travel   dries your hair quickly  i have multiple remington hairdryers and this is my least favorite   it is loud and heavy to hold   it actually takes longer to dry my hair than the other ones i own   love the color  but thats about it   the other two remington hair dryers i own have added benefits of smoothing or taming frizz  etc    this one doesn t do any of that    it s just a normal  no thrills hair dryer and takes almost twice as long to dry my hair on the highest  hottest setting     the motor doesn t seem as strong in this one   would not purchase in the future  love this dryer     hair dries quicker and is so convenient to travel with  a hair dryer is not something i generally replace until i need it   mine is still working   but i had been saying for a while that i needed a new one   i ve always just looked at it as something that blows air and that they are all pretty much the same   after using this one a few times   i will never say that again   this hair dryer is awesome   i had already switched my curling irons to ionic ceramic and could tell a big difference   but i didn t realize that it would also make a difference in a hair dryer   not only does it dry my hair faster   but it leaves it looking much more healthy   i have very long hair and even though i take good care of it   i had noticed that it was looking dull and dry   the first time i used this dryer   i could tell a difference   i don t know all the   34 how  34  or   34 why  34  reasons   but i do know that my hair didn t look or feel like all the moisture had been stripped from it   i had even started to air dry my hair because i could see what was happening to it   but that takes a long time with thick   long hair   i will still air dry when i have the time   but now i feel like i can dry my hair quickly  and this dryer does it very quick    and not be damaging it   i don t use the high heat on this one because it s very hot and my fine hair wouldn t like that   but i like knowing that the option is there if needed   the air flow with this is massive     really powerful    when on high   i can dry my hair in a few minutes   but that s only when i m just drying it to put in a ponytail   medium is more than enough airflow to dry and style it  and i love the cool setting   when i used a round brush to curl   i finished with the cool setting and it made all the difference   it s not a small dryer   but it s not at all heavy    especially considering the power that it contains  br     they include a little card explaining that their products are made by women   i find that reassuring  since most men that i know don t really use one   therefore   how could they know what we need   they also donate a portion of their profits to charities that benefit women   between that and the fact that you get such a high end  quality made product  for such a reasonable price   i  am totally sold on this company   you can tell that they care about their products   i highly recommend it   i can t imagine anyone not loving it  br   i did receive this product free for the purpose of testing and reviewing with my honest opinion   and i couldn t be happier to tell you how wonderful this dryer is efore   how could they know what we need   they also donate a portion of their profits to charities that benefit women   between that and the fact that you get such a high end  quality made product  for such a reasonable price   i  am totally sold on this company   you can tell that they care about their products   i highly recommend it   i can t imagine anyone not loving it  i did receive this product free for the purpose of testing and reviewing with my honest opinion   and i couldn t be happier to tell you how wonderful this dryer is  great   exactly what i expected needed to get a less powerful blow dryer when i moved to a place with crappy outlets that were killing my other dryers  the minipro is super tiny and looks like it could be for a doll  but surprisingly works great for me  made well and feels sturdy  my dry time seems to be shorter  i have fine hair though  my stepdaughter has long medium hair and it dried her pretty quick as well  love the color  very light weight and will be perfect for travel  especially love the travel bag it comes with  so cute  been using this dryer a few weeks now and no complaints  only wish is that it had a cool setting  quiet  excellent drying  doesn t get dangerously hot  really enjoying this dryer  works really well for my curly hair  i had a really nice pricey dryer  similar to this one  for years and when it gave out i bought a dept store  30 dryer  i noticed immediately that my hair was getting frizzy  i used that for several months and then finally decided to break down and shell out the cash for this dryer  so glad that i did  br    br   i mostly use it with the curl diffuser on warm heat  i get great curls and less frizz  on occasion i use the directional attachment to straighten my bangs or all of my hair and i love that too  makes my hair silky smooth  br    br   the last time i bathed my dog i used the other nozzle that is supposed to be   34 quick dry   34  that was really amazing  dried my little dog in no time  i was happy and she seemed to be relieved  i imagine that if you don t need to worry about frizz  this quick dry nozzle would be great if you re in a hurry  br    br   i ve had this for several weeks and i would recommend it  hoping this one lasts quite a while  nice little unit but it will fry your body parts if you re not careful   very powerful  this thing is awesome   small  compact  powerful  this thing stores well as it folds up  for those of us that have limited bathroom space and cabinets or travel often  conair has been making quality products for years and they have always been affordable  it s ok for the price  br    br   the plastic feels cheap  the sliding button occasionally is difficult to move and when removing the difusser  i feel as i may break it  the plug isn t the most secure either  seeming to fit loosely in the socket  despite this  it gets hot enough for my needs and hasn t failed me yet after about 6 months of use  if you need a cheap blow dryer this is a great pick  was a great dryer  loved it  however it burned out within 2 months  i received this item as a test product for the vine review program  but this is a great hair dryer for a low price  it has 1875 watts  which is 25 more than most  and more ion presentation for quicker hair drying  ions are funny things ionized air respells water  and deionized water falls off easier  so if there was a way you could wash your hair in di water  you would really have it made  cleaner hair that dries very fast  but i digress  this dryer does the job of a much more expensive professional dryer  it is a good buy  great i was afraid that this hair dryer would not be top quality because of the price  however  everything about it seems great  this dryer leaves my hair shiny and soft  has good variety of settings  and that necessary cool shot of air to set my hair for the day  highly recommend  can t beat the price point  love this  great power  adjustable speeds  works awesome  love it   best cheap hair dryer ever love this blow dryer  was for my mother who has always used one   it worked wonderfully for her   she liked the settings for heat control   that was a big concern for her  works very good for the price but wow it is very heavy and takes time to get use to perfect dryer great blow dry   shiny hair and fast blow dry awesome dryer  i have been looking for something like this for quite sometime  sleek  comfortable to hold  works great  so happy that i purchased this item  great  lightweight  use every day for past year almost   love it   best price too  cheap and comfortable  defenetly worth it it stopped working today after working wonderfully for a few months    this is a nice basic hairdryer  we have a big family and own several remington hairdryers  this one is in the kids bathroom  with its smaller grip it s a good size for older kids and teens to use  it dries hair fairly quickly  on par with most other dryers we ve owned  we keep it on a command adhesive hook above the outlet to the side of the sinks  the cord has a good sized built in loop for hanging  br    br   i was really happy to find that it comes with both a wide  flat nozzle for straightening as well as a diffuser for curly styles  my fancy high end dryer didn t come with a diffuser and it took forever to find one that fit  i also like that it has a cool button  no need to slide a button up and down to set a style with cool air  br    br   my one complaint is that this dryer is a bit noisier than the other remington dryers we have  it s not so noisy that it consider it loud for a hairdryer but if you re searching for a quiet model know this one is average to slightly above average as far as noise goes  br    br   all in all i m impressed with this hairdryer  it s a fantastic value at this price point  all our other remington s have lasted years  it has a good quality  i remember my daughter always on a hurry and sometimes drops this dryer on the floor and its still on one piece  that is so great  it didn t break easily delivery was fast  within a week  the first time using it i noticed that on all 3 settings the air is just warm  doesn t get very hot  which i thought wasn t that big of a deal considering my hair is bleached and i shouldn t be putting a lot of heat on it anyway  the second time i used it the high setting just didn t work  i switched it from medium to high and it just turned off when on the high setting  i had already thrown out the packaging at this point so since it was only like  13 i didn t feel like it was really even worth it to try to return  amazing dryer    it makes my hair soft and easy dry  even though the price is expensive but i really recommend this product to others   i like pink color very pretty  very useful      i really do like it  it is so handy and drys my hair very good  i would recommend it to anyone that needs a hair dryer  my wife love it  its not heavi and powerfull excellent product  and dries my long thick hair very fast  works excellent  light weight also which i like very much  this is a decent hair dryer  and we usually buy the less expensive ones because they seem to last as long  if not longer  than more expensive ones   on this one  the handle doesn t fold  which is kind of a pain for storing  and it only has two heat settings  which my wife found to be either too hot and not hot enough  so she went back to her old one   the removable filter is a simple plastic screen that screws off of the back so it can be washed   it s nothing special  but it s a nice touch that you can remove it vs  trying to get all the gunk out while wrangling the rest of the dryer   we don t use the attachments for curly hair  so while they were included and seem durable  we d not be able to say how well they work   at any rate  it s a good dryer we ll keep in the guest bathroom and can serve as a functional backup  bought this as a damaged box item  it was in perfect condition  it is a professional hairdryer so keep in mind it is solid   somewhat heavier than your basic  cheap home brand  the accent parts are pink  a light   34 princess  34  pink   something that is not totally obvious on a mobile screen  not a big deal  but i would prefer white or black  hair dryer has a good weight to it and it feels solidly built  hot cold function works fine  i would like a bit more volume to the air  something that all newer hair driers seem to lack  i have one from 1991 that is like a tornado on its highest setting  everything about this hairdryer seems nice  except for the power  it is so weak  i do have thick hair but have another conair that is much more powerful  br   i would have returned this  but was able to swap with a friend who has thin hair  very good small light and powerful   i love this hair dryer  dries my fine curly hair quickly  good price  too  great blowdryer    i looked up for reviews before i purchased and i could not be happier  drys really fast and its very hot    found this gem in a hotel in savannah and liked it so much i took a photo and found it on amazon   bought two  one for each bathroom  awesome works great  it s so cute  wonderfully small and pretty hot pink color  it does the job  i have fine hair and this dryer doesn t overpower me or my hair  nice and lightweight  you might think  oh  this little thing isn t going to do anything  but it does  highly recommended for fine hair  bought this for my girlfriend  she loves it  can t give it a 5 because she doesn t believe in them  and i haven t used it for myself seeing how my hair is nearly to my scalp haha  love these fast shipping has lots of power my friend recommended this blower she loves it so i am very excited to use mine used once   recently cut hair   sure to use it again after hot weather ends  the best hair dryer ever   we traveled to nyc over the summer   at the seton hotel  these were the hair dryers they had for guests to use   my hair was not dry   it had a variety of settings and was not noisy   i came home immediately an ordered one   wen shampoo and this hair dryer word well together      i have 3b curly hair and the diffuser attachment works amazing  it doesn t make my hair frizzy but provides a lift to my roots  the dryer is super lightweight and is very quite  i keep it on low and the power is still amazing  it cut my hair routine by half  i would highly recommend this to anyone with 3b curly hair  i bought this in march and by july it stopped blowing hot air  it s such a shame because it was a really great hair dryer when it was working  i noticed other reviewers have said the same thing  which makes me think it s a flaw in the design  excellent hair dryer  but my impression is that the controls could be a little more ergonomic   quieter than most hair dryers  i particularly like the small rubber nubs on the side which help keep it on your counter   3 fan settings and 2 heat settings  3 if you include heat off  plus a   34 cool shot  34  button  good use  it s very compact  make sure to buy plug head adapters because it is dual voltage use but you still need head adapters to fit the sockets abroad  dryer was delivered on time   it is powerful  dries my short hair in 2 minutes and isn t heavy   love it  it arrived within 2 3 days and works perfectly  i have thick  frizzy  curly hair and never have been able to blow dry it because it gets so much poofier  however  with the diffuser this blow dryer made my curls shiny and soft  no frizz or poof  i m in love  very nice the hair dryer is fine if you don t need to change the voltage  but i bought it for international traveling  and it s a big con for me that the switch doesn t turn to 250 volts  it looks as though it can easily turn with a coin  do not be fooled  it s impossible to turn the switch to 250 volts  i stripped the switch bare trying to turn the damn thing  i can barely see where the arrow is  which points to which voltage setting it s at  luckily for me  sarcasm   mine is permanently at 125 volts  maybe mine was faulty  but i was definitely not happy with this product  would not recommend to a friend  two stars only because the hair dryer itself works fine and because it s cheap  the hair dryer is great  multiple hear and speed options  i would have given it five stars except for that fact that the funnel tip does pop off too easily if bumped by a brush  excellent hairdryer  folds up nicely  haven t had the opportunity to test it on 240v yet  but i m sure it ll do just fine  turning the dial on the handle locks you out of putting it on the high setting whenever you re using it with 240v  which is a really user friendly addition   you re not suppose to use it on high with 240v according to the manual   works great  no need to purchase a hairdryer with a price tag higher than this    this item is great  br   great price and the best thing i like is that i ll be able to use it any where in the world  thanks much nice dryer and very handy wall mount  the hair dryer had great power and dried my hair really fast  however  it caught fire in less than a month   i had to send it back  dryer works very well for  me  this hair drier is great  mostly because it is much quieter than most others  this is a big plus  especially for shared bathrooms  it comes with a couple adapter pieces that either diffuse the air or focus it  depending on what your hair is like  it is clearly very nice quality  the only thin that would be nice is a retractable cord  but that is a small quibble  highly recommended  im a dude first off  at first i thought it was real heavy then i got used to it however this is my first hair dryer as i am growing my hair longer  ladies beware of the weight however it drys my hair very quickly its about 4 in all the way around right now and takes about 30sec tops completely dry  when you buy it there is multiple settings you just have to play with the two switches that flip up and down  not pictured it comes with a funnel and the funnel with the comb on both sides         br   im 1 for 1 br   take my advice at your own risk  best light weight powerful hair dryer i have ever owned  this is a sturdy  powerful hair dryer   my stylist recommended it and it does not disappoint   we like this little beast around here  i have short thick somewhat unruly hair  my daughter has long curly naughty at times hair  it works well for both of us  it got the job done fast with out being uncomfortably hot and feeling very heavy  that s not to say its very small or it would not make the best grab and go pack it up dryer  but its no cumbersome either  it left out hair very manageable  love the two extensions and option for different heat and speed settings  remington makes quality items for a fair price  we like it  this is an extra dryer we use upstairs after the kids take their baths  br    br   ergonomics is good and you don t accidentally press any buttons while holding it at various angles   the fan speeds are powerful and the different heat settings are definitely appreciated   also  it has the typical   34 cool shot  34  button  br    br   it comes with a blade diverter attachment as well as a volumizer attachment  br    br   the length of the cord is reasonable even with a 1 yr old running around  br    br   the weight and feel are good as well as it has a high quality feel to it  perhaps the ceramic coating or so  doesn t feel plastic y at all   we would definitely recommend this to any household from little toddlers to adults  i really like this product   it s compact  but powerful  and pretty lightweight   does a good job drying my fine hair  i ve fine hair  but a lot of it  in scant minutes   the only thing it isn t  is quiet  but they don t advertise it as such  just pointing it out though   i m very pleased with it  when i first received this i absolutely loved it   great power  the cord was sturdy and extra long  and it worked really well   however  i am returning it for a refund  because one month after getting it  the   34 hi   lo  34  switch stopped working and it would only work on   34 high  34    i thought i could live with that but this morning when i was using it the switch in the handle started feeling really hot and smoke started coming out of it   so i don t know if it was just a fluke and this particular one was defective  or if it is something that happens often with this model   i was really disappointed though because i was really pleased with it when it was working as it was supposed to  it works pretty good for the money    tried and true   my last conair lasted 15 years   i was so glad to see the style was still available   compact  but has power  this hair dryer was out of stock for more than 2 months  i even tried xtava com to buy this hair dryer but to no avail  i contacted their customer service but they just asked me to wait so i waited and waited  i didn t want to buy any other hair dryer  i just had to have this hair dryer because of its 2200w power and nice design  consequently  i ended up having to endure the life of no hair dryer for nearly 3 months  but  after using this hair dryer today for the first time  i absolutely do not regret the long wait  the hairdryer blows air very softly if that s such a thing   needs more power  i feel like it takes longer to dry my hair  this dryer is lightweight  yet has a quality feel to it   it fits your hand well  has nice adjustability  an dries your hair well without over drying it  br    br   i think the price is quite reasonable too   seems like a product that will last  and of course it s not a   34 no name  34  product  but a remington  so presumably the quality is there  br    br   a nice dryer at a nice price   5 stars  works good for me  no problems and i use it damn near everyday works great in my cottage up north  br   recommended to hotel   motel owners who want a secure way to provide a hairdryer to guests  without losing it  my girls say this works great   much better than their old one   dries hair fast  love the product  very fast shipping  i really like this product  the cord seems to be way longer than what i am used to  i really like the tools it comes with    good functionality but too heavy  love this dryer  i noticed a big difference after using just once  hair felt healthier  perfect   light weight  within less than four months  i noticed a fiery red glow within the barrel and had to stop using for fear of my hair catching on fire   the company was nice enough to refund my money once i could finally get hold of someone  note there are no phone numbers provided with the dryer or on their website   however i do not recommend due to safety issues  excellent product  excellent customer service  good i ve had 3 of these hair druers and was happy with them because of the folding feature  the last one i purchased through amazon stopped heating correctly within 2 weeks of use  thats just poor     meh  it just doesn t work that well for me   i think the diffuser needs to be smaller and curved more to better fit the shape of a person s head   somehow my wavy curls end up being too smooshed flat against my head  then sticking out toward the ends   not a fan  wish i hadn t tossed the box  it was ordered for a friend whose wife runs a beauty shop and he says it working fine solidly built hair dryer   diffuser stays on and doesn t pop off on a moment s notice as did a revlon drier i used to have but which fell apart in less than a year     am returing to bed bath beyond  nice built in hook for hanging  plenty powerful  not too noisy  price was ok  all in all  works better than a towell and or shaking the head a lot to remove water   haha in the past year i have stopped blow drying my hair straight  opting to let my curls be free  i love that this dryer has a diffuser attachment  most hair dryers only come with the concentrator attachment  my curls  which have really improved since quitting straightening now take forever to dry  since my hair is not dried out  anymore  i can use this on my curls to dry them quickly  since i hate leaving the house with wet hair  the diffuser works well  not frizzing my hair at all and my curls are bouncier than when they air dry  that s a great plus  i only need about 5 minutes of drying time to achieve 95  dry hair  it has a cool shot and also a high low feature  this dryer gets very hot  so i dry my curls on the medium setting  which is still hot  the higher setting would be better for straightening  i have owned this product  it lasted 3 years  the fan blades shattered into pieces   i chose to replace it with the same unit  that translates into  10  yr   prior to the oster i had sunbeams  one lasted 8 years  they are no longer available  there cost was 2 3 rds the cost of the oster  where are the economical competitors  functionally  the latest oster is much improved regarding sound  in fact it is whisper quiet by comparison  overall  the product is very nice in display and function  best blow dryer ever for my wild curls  i used to have to live the house with wet hair and hope for the best   not anymore  the speed and heat settings make it super easy to tame the frizz  i love the price i had this one for over 3 years and it worked great   it just recently died and i bought the exact same model   the retractable cord is so nice  i rarely use a hair dryer to dry my hair but lately  i am tired of waiting for it to air dry   when that happens  i use my handy dandy john frieda full volume hairy dryer   when i was offered the opportunity to try this product  i quickly accepted   i received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion   i actually received this product almost 2 years ago   i use it when i want my hair dried quickly  br    br   the john frieda full volume dryer features frizz fighting technology  3 heat and two speed settings  i can add volume and shine to my hair with just a few minutes of use  br    br   my hair takes just a few minutes to dry  the hair dryer is very lightweight in my hands  so it doesn   take a lot to blow dry my hair   i use the cool setting most of the time since i don t like to use heat on my hair   the cool setting comes in handy in the summer time   who wants to blow hot air on their hair in the dead of summer  br    br   the john frieda full volume dryer comes with 3 attachments  but i choose to use the dryer without any attachments  i just want to dry my hair  so i don   bother with the attachments   i received a sample product to review in exchange for my honest opinion  very good for the hair and face  excellent       update  3 years and goin strong  good product   original review     been over a year  love this thing  has different heat settings and attachments  is yeah and it s cute to boot i ve had my wall mounted oster for over 20 years   it is starting to smell so i am now looking for a new one   i only had to clean it once   mine only has 1200  watts  but i have always had short hair so that may have made a difference for the long length of time i ve owned it   but i have loved it since i bought it and i use it every day since i wash my hair  when i shower every morning before leaving for work  i use this on my dog after i give her a bath  great this is the second blower i ve owned  i almost went for the newer style   so glad i didn t  i just love this model and i don t think i ll ever look to change  it s a great  reliable blower and the power behind this puppy is awesome  i tend to have frizzy hair  so i need a good blower to smooth it out  this is the perfect choice to remedy this hair type      excellent product  what i asked was what got me great hair dryer  it is less noisy that my other hair dryer  beautiful finish    really good to use i bought this keeping in mind that the cool shot button may not work after reading a review  i blow dry my hair at most 3 times for the year so for me it does the job  i use the cool setting which still feels a little warm to me but it helps to stretch my hair very well but without the heat damage  i still use heat protectant though   but   the cool shot button definitely doesn t work fine product wish i had one years ago  i ve been using this for a few months now and i      love it       its does a great job  i always use the cool setting and you know what it stays cool  unlike other dryers that you have to keep holding a button  this one has a low temp setting that remain moderately temperature  the burst of cool air button gets even cooler  thats what i really like about this dryer along with the slim design is very cool  okay enough with the   34 cool  34  xd its a great product  you won t be disappointed  love this hair dryer  for years  i had a terrible old dryer that wouldn t die  when it finally did  i was worried that anything new i got would be junky like so many electronics these days  i have had this hair dryer for about a year now and still love it as much as i did the day i got it  it dries really fast without being too hot to damage my hair  it has a satiny finish that feels nice in your hand too  my hair dryer broke and i needed a replacement   i keep my hair dryer plugged in by my sink and i worried about my grandkids accidentally dropping it in the sink so i bought this wall mounted unit   i absolutely love it   so convenient and it s more powerful than my old hair dryer   i may get another one for the other bathroom  i ve had this blow dryer for a year or so and i love it  i haven t had to replace it i really like this hair dryer  it dries my hair quickly   thoroughly  even though just a little heavy  excellent product   highly recommended great buy after my  60  salon brand hair dryer crapped out on me after like 4 months  i decided to just look for a hair dryer with a great price  i did not even realize that it s a conditioning dryer and now my hair never looked better  my old dryer made my hair look dry and unhealthy and i can t believe how much better it looks now  i love it   it doesn t get super hot but dries my long thick hair fast and fluffy  i ve had it for a little over a year now and it is still working great  i love it for its practicality and efficiency   it is quiet all right  shipment was received in short time  br   hair dryers are easy to installed love this product  love this blow dryer  for those of you who have curly hair and have issues with bigger dyers  this is the one for you  blows hot air around br   but now we really want it br   hope it doesn t melt so easy to install  so sturdy  i love it  dries my hair in no time  a really great investment  love it  great dryer   works extremely well      love the automatic rewind     works great  just follow the directions     very satisfied with this dryer  i am 58 years old and have mid length  medium texture  slightly wavy hair  br   for the past 15 years i have been using the same conair hairdryer  it just will not die  an average of 2 3x a week and over that time have had my share of good hair days and bad  br   recently  i ve noticed that my hair has been getting very dry   even in the summer which is very unusual  br   so  after trying various shampoos with not much difference  i decided to google  dry hair  and low and behold  hair dryers popped up  i don t think i would have come up with that on my own  so of course i then started researching hair dryers  there are about as many  top ten hair dryer  lists as i think there are hair dryers  while there are a couple of  pricey  brands that tend to show up on most of those lists  i finally decided to look at it a different way ie  what  technologies  exist and what would work best with my hair  i like a lot of volume and smoothness  so ionic  ceramic  tourmaline with infra red seemed to fit the bill   which is everything this dryer has  i read pretty much all of the reviews  watched the youtube videos and even tho  people complained about the weight and button positions  i decided to give it a try  well  i have to say that i am literally blown away  first  i understand why people complain about the button position as the first time i used it  i also kept changing speed and heat settings  however  it took me no time at all to figure out how to hold it so that doesn t happen  the heat levels are nice and consistent and the cool shot button works great   doesn t  lock  but i don t care as i just shoot the roots before i finish each section so works fine for me  regarding the weight  that was the only thing that i was a bit concerned about at first  since my old dryer was super light   now  after using it for the second time  i didn t even notice the weight  only the incredibly awesome results it produces  i actually feel like i have new hair as it is no longer dry and frizzy but instead is super smooth  soft and bouncy  i still can t believe changing hair dryers could make such a difference  i actually look forward to doing my hair now  my recommendation is  do your research  but if you have hair similar to mine  give this fantastic dryer a try   i don t think you ll be disappointed frizzy but instead is super smooth  soft and bouncy  i still can t believe changing hair dryers could make such a difference  i actually look forward to doing my hair now  my recommendation is  do your research  but if you have hair similar to mine  give this fantastic dryer a try   i don t think you ll be disappointed  great for the price  strong and powerful  best blow dryer i have ever owned  my 4c hair gets pretty straight using this not even on the high setting  works great       light enough to be comfortable  excellent  arrived right on time  performs very well  is quieter than expected and is compact for traveling this blow dryer works great for travel  it is small  lightweight and is very easy to convert for various power needs as i traveled from country to country on a recent trip  my only very small complaint would be that it is very loud to operate  awesome power  just a little heavy   this is a really good dryer  i have had it for five months  and it works well  i wish it was higher powered  but i wouldn t return it  compact  easy to travel with   puts out plenty of air   works very well  good unit   a little pricey but i was replacing a 7 or 8 year old like unit so i did not want to change unit or mounting system  low setting is to strong and to fast also the dryer is too heavy not as powerful as some this size   easy to mount to wall   it does have a bright night light  i bought this dryer for my girlfriend for her birthday last year because she is always complaining about getting her hair done and how much people charge her  which i end up paying for anyway  so i thought what better thing to buy her for her birthday than something she can use and benefit from forever  she loves this hair dryer  she puts her hair in rollers and sits under  it gets very hot too  thanks for the great buy  just a really nice hair dryer for the money    videoid 3ce786db72a405f72c6e511ec156f72d  i have needed a hair dryer forever and finally got this one  i am so happy because the vent on my old one was sucking my hair inside and i would have to break by hair to get it out  br    br   this hairdryer is very nice and durably constructed  it feels substantial in my hands  not flimsy and cheap  it comes with 2 diffuser type attachments that connects easily and stay in place until you take them off  br    br   the cord on this hairdryer is super long so i can move around quite a bit while drying my hair  there is also a loop built in the handle so this hair dryer can be hung up for storage purposes  br    br   the hairdryer itself has a cool shot button which you hold down if you want cool air to blow out  there is another button that changes the forcefulness of the air that is blowing out  this one has 2 settings   the last button is high  medium and low for the warmth of the heat that will blow out of the hair dryer  br    br   this hair dryer is 1875 watts so it is pretty powerful and it dries my hair pretty quickly  the infrared light actually is an orange red color and it helps to reduce static and frizz  br    br   i am very impressed with this hair dryer and i wish i would have gotten it sooner  br    br   i received this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review  used one in a hotel and replaced my huge home dryer  does a great job and meets all my expectations for heat and air  doesn t retract  very cheaply made  i returned the prodcut  this blow dryer is hot and powerful   dries my hair super fast  like 2 minutes fast   this is by far the nicest blow dryer i have ever owned  excellent product  worked as advertised  powerful and light  i ve had this for a couple years  it s been very good  the cord is a little short  otherwise  no complaints  no issues whatsoever   br    br   completely satisfied with this product   love it very very powerful  and gets hot if you need it to  cord is average wish it was longer as this feels more like a professional blower  love the feel of the blower too it doesn t slide out of your hands and it s not very heavy  love it  it is very powerful hair dryer  i like it because it also folds up   takes less space way better quality than i expected for the price  love it   exactly what i wanted  great price  retracting cord a little hard to get use to  don t retract it most of the time  it s ok  the dryer itself works great   but the attachments don t stay on  i was spending more time picking the attachments up off the floor than drying my hair  really a piss poor design very frustrating good quality  works great  great stand  movable good performance for the price i paid  not as hot as salon dryers  perfect  great dryer  dries quickly  love the different temperature settings  it is a little heavier than i expected  but so far  so good  love this blow dryer works well   just as good as a  200 00 unit good this is absolutely the best thing i ve ever brought on amazon and i ve brought a lot of stuff  the only reason why i gave it 3 stars is because it takes a little longer to dry my hair than the salon but i will take that extra 30 mins saving  60 a week going to the salon  i have malaysian hair sew in  i usually go to the salon every week for a roller wrap or some wand curls but i will never ever go back to the salon again unless i m going for a sew in  my curls come out so bouncy and pretty  i look like i just stepped out of a salon  the dryer was easy to assemble and it s better being in the comfort of my own home good product and quite  great this one replaced the last remington that i had  and loved  since 2002  i have very long hair that s color treated  and these types of hair dryers are a life saver   i hope this one lasts 13 years    added bonus    it matches my purple accented bathroom      bought this for my sister in law and she was very happy i purchased this because the sidewalks at my workplace are very uneven  and every time it rains we get huge puddles that cannot be avoided  my shoes always get drenched  and i needed a way to quickly and easily dry them  for that purpose  i ve found this hair dryer to be very useful and efficient  i also use it to warm my socks in the winter  there s no better feeling than being out in the cold with warm feet  br    br   i can t speak to its intended purpose  as i don t have hair and so have not used it to dry my hair  please don t hold this against me  before buying this item  please read this review  it could save you from being buying a defective item that could burn you  br    br   when i opened up the package  the packing for the blow dryer was bent and looked open  despite that  i thought maybe it just got damaged from shipping  when i opened up the package  it looked used  the blowdryer itself and the attachments  especially the diffuser  were all scratched  almost like they were used  still  i thought    34 maybe this was just a packaging issue and got damaged via ups or during the shipping process   34  i wanted to test out the product before returning it  i severely regret even trying out this item before returning it  br    br   i plugged in the blow dryer and attached the diffuser attachment  it didn t seem to blow air very well at all  my  25 conair blow dryer actually blows out more air than this did  i only had the blow dryer plugged in for maybe a minute and realized it just didn t work  i actually got burnt because the diffuser got so hot  i now have a little welt on me from accidentally touching it  i can easily seeing this blow dryer causing a fire or really harming somebody  i will never buy a  pro beauty tools  item again  the fact that this item was even labeled as a   34 professional   34  blow dryer is a joke  it blows no air and is cheaply made  the supposed  150 value is a joke  as well  like i said  my  25 conair blow dryer is much  much better than this joke of a dryer br    br   now i have no blow dryer  a mini welt and irritated skin  save your time  physical health and money and buy something else  like i said  i can really see this endangering somebody    whether by burning them severely  i wasn t even using the dryer for 2 minutes before becoming burnt  or causing a fire of some sort  the diffuser attachment also stayed hot for quite awhile which i ve never seen before with a blow dryer before  great    very pleased with this travel hair dryer  compact and lightweight and works really well  works good this is my third one in 15 years   they are convenient and very reliable   a great buy  great dryer  i have had this for several years and it still works great  definitely recommend  i have never had a blow dryer this amazing before  i don t even know where to begin   the first thing i noticed was this blow dryer is a little heavier than my current blow dryer    i guess that s what it takes to be such a phenomenal blow dryer  it s not so heavy that you won t want to use it  and it s surprisingly compact  br    br   you get two attachments  a concentrator nozzle  which if you ve never used one before is amazing for keeping your hair smooth and silky   you get a finger diffuser as well  which is great for curly hair or waves without the frizz   i ve never been able to blow dry my hair and get curls that i love up until now   normally my hair is a big ball of frizz after blowdrying it  but i was able to get frizz free curls with the help of this diffuser  br    br   i straighten my hair frequently and for the longest time i had to let my hair dry overnight because blow drying my hair would just cause it to frizz and even using a straightener wouldn t get rid of the frizz   now i just use the concentrator nozzle and it really helps keep the frizz at bay when i want to blow dry it straight   quite possibly my favorite thing about this blow dryer is the fact that not only does it have a cool shot button  it has a cool setting  i have a lot of hair and holding down that cool shot button for my whole hair can be a pain  now i can just switch it to the cool setting  overall  i love this blow dryer  it s the best one i ve ever owned  br    br   i received this product for free in exchange for my honest  unbiased review  like it but not too much perhaps it s strange coming from me  but i ve purchased 2 of these and it s still my favorite blow dryer  br   i used this dryer for more than 4 years and never had a problem  br   i purchased a second one because i gave the first one to my fiance   who lives in japan  br   her mom fell in love with it  didn t bring it to the states so i had to buy yet another conair blow dryer     br   but now she has my second one  and won t accept the conair infiniti pro i bought for her  br   too bad  because i miss my cordless action    br   but i can still blow dry my hair after taking the braids out  because this is by far the best dryer ever  a great item to have when traveling to europe because of its dual voltage capability   easy to use  convenient to carry  this is the best hair dryer i have ever purchased  it provides tons of power and isn t loud  it dries my hair quickly and doesn t hsve shutting off issues like other dryers i have used  the bed head brand seems to be experts in their field and make products that work well and hold up well  they last a long time and i have no complaints  good hair dryer for the price  thank you  does the job at an unbeatable price  i have very thick romanian long straight hair and this dries my hair well and pretty fast  great product and would buy again if i had to  just does not get hot enough bought it for my daughter   works great  and she likes it  more power than expected  works great for its intended use  especially for how small it is  love this hair dryer     it gets hot enough and blows hard enough to dry your hair quickly      my teenage girls with long hair love it too      it also lasts forever     powerful yet compact hair dryer  works really well  this is the absolute best blow dryer i have ever owned and i have owned many over the last 45 years  my favorite so far  takes less time to dry and is quiet  my original one stopped working after about 1 1 2 year  they sent me a replacement right away  i had the new one in 2 days  great purchase  great product  very fast shipment  love it my old con air finally bit the dust  i had been impressed with my hair stylist s hair dryer  but i knew such an expensive unit was out of my budget  however  i was willing to spend a little more than  20 on a drugstore hair dryer that  hopefully  would last a bit longer this time  i have very short  very  very fine hair  when it was longer  i used to require a diffuser since it is naturally wavy  however  with my current pixie cut  i knew i only really needed a unit that came with a concentrator nozzle  because of the short length and fineness of my hair  i also wanted a unit that had a good range of temperatures and speeds  a lot of what s available on the market now is too hot and too powerful for my hair  i did a bit of research for hair dryers that matched my criteria and finally settled on this  the extremely positive reviews left by other amazon customers gave me confidence i had made a good decision  br    br   happily enough  turns out i was correct  this unit feels solid  it is well constructed  and doesn t have the   34 hot spots  34  like my old con air did that caused its paint to flake off everywhere  it is a touch heavier than my old dryer  but i like the way it feels in my hand  the bit of added weight does not make the unit any more difficult to use  it is also powerful  the motor on this dryer is of much better quality than any i ve used previously  causing an increase of air throughput that allows the unit to dry hair very quickly  paradoxically  this unit performs much better than any 1875 w hair dryer i ve ever used  and yet it is much  much quieter  and range of airflows gives it finesse  it comes with 3 different temperature settings and 3 different airflow settings  and i have found the medium temperature and medium airflow to be perfect for my needs  if you use the highest temperature setting  it will get hot  so if you need the high temp and high power  it is definitely there for you  it also comes with a concentrator nozzle  the output width of which in my opinion  is the perfect length  some nozzles tend to be exorbitantly wide  which is probably fine if you have a lot of hair  but the output width of this nozzle is only around 2  34   perfect for a shortie like me  br    br   what more can i say  i am extremely happy with this purchase  it does arrive in a box that looks like it came straight out of the late 80s early 90s  which i just found to be humorous  it is very no muss  no fuss  and i don t even think mine had packaged instructions with it  but it works just as well as my stylist s professional dryer and at a terrific price point  i would buy again in a heartbeat  but hopefully i won t have to  at least for a long  long time   i love this hair dryer  garbage  had it for a year  the cheap plastic fan is cracked and it s done  much quieter than my old hairdryer  works great  love the option for   34 warm  34     34 hot  34  or   34 cool  34  settings  wish it collapsed so it fit in my drawer better but otherwise its great for the price  my sister is a hairdresser and she buys cheap hair dryers  says its not worth the money to buy expensive ones  works great   this brand was in our resort in florida and my husband just had to have his own  for the price it was not bad works fine  price is right  strong blow   great design   it has a bit of a weight to it but its great      i got no diffuser but i got a concentrator attachment very good nice i love this hair dryer the only thing it is missing is a retractable cord my hair dryer took a dump and nothing i hate more than finding another one   after reading the reviews  i purchased the conair pro styler ionic conditioning hair dryer   it was ok but did nothing for my fine thin hair   i was going to get another revlon hair dryer but thought ok i will give this one a try even though it has the same wattage as the conair pro styler and with a 35  amazon prime member sale discount  what the heck  i really couldn t go too wrong  love it   my hair was much smoother and the mild curl i like was put into my hair with ease  minimal fly aways which the revlon didn t minimize   found my dryer  the hair dryer is stylish and does a fine job with hair drying   i like the hook on the side that keeps the cord in place  best blow dryer for price love it   quiet and powerful  cord retracts well  not very strong  does the job  doesn t have a lot of heft so it makes me think it won t last long  which is fine since we don t really love it  amazing blow dryer  worth every penny  i have naturally curly hair and this blow dryer gets it almost totally straight  amazing power and heat  product just like expected and shipping was fast for the free option  got it in about a week  love it so far i love this hair dryer  i was bummed that my old conair died after 10 years  yes you read that right  10 years   i loved that hair dryer and i loved how quickly it dried my hair  the new dryer works well so far  it has different speeds and heat levels on two different controls which i really like  the cold air button works great  i really have no complaints  i m a professional hairdresser and unusual buy chi  which are 3 times the cost of this at first i bought 1 to see how i liked it   i loved this dryer needless to say i bought another  been extremely  happy with it   amazing hair dryer    update 07 09 17    this dryer has been getting very hot on the hand piece  it makes a click noise and then gets hot  i recently saw sparks shoot when the clicking occured and am scared to use it  my husband and i looked at it together and he was able to see it spark multiple times while on  i hate that this has occured but feel the need to warn others  br   original review  his almost perfect  i love the finish  very hot with several great settings  its a bit heavy  the cord is a bit short  my hair has been sucked into the mesh filter in back several times  knotting it and burning it  i have longer hair and this happens when i flip my head over and the ends touch the back of the dryer while drying roots  i have had to learn to keep space  i would buy it again though  good  it s nice and dries quickly  just it s super noisy  can wake the neighbors up  this is a great dryer for the price  omg i love this blow dryer   i just recently replaced my old blow dryer with this one and i can see a huge improvement in my hair   it dries quickly and stores nicely   love this  i have bought this same or very similar dryer for each of my last three houses  i love them mounted right next to the bathroom sink  it works well and for the money i think they are of pretty good quality  works great not very loud  it s hot which is fine with me  best blow dry that i have ever owned   worth the money   cord never gets tied up this is my absolute favorite hairdryer  i have been using it for probably 10 years  when i moved out after college  i bought one for my apartment since my mom wanted to keep hers  haha  it works amazing  i adore the diffuser attachment  best one i ve ever used  this blow dryer dries my hair in half the time my old one did  my hair is really curly and i like it better straight and this product has the power to make my hair nice and smooth without much effort  it has a cool blast switch to lock the style in place  i don t have to use as much hair product because this blow dryer makes my hair straight with basically just a brush  if you have frizzy hair this is the blow dryer for you mom s love it nice and compact with lots of drying power  also not as loud as some other hair driers  i like the way it folds up  but the cord rarely retracts all the way without spending 5 minutes pulling it out and pressing the retract button and pushing it back into the handle  the blower itself works fine  but i bought it for the retractable cord  which is more a pain than a gain  great good second time buying this item because i wore the first one out  love it  quick drying of hair without making it brittle   gave my hair quite a bit of volume as well which was a plus  i did not like the design or the size so i sent it back  pretty clunky looking and too large for my dinky bathroom  the ideal hair dryer  small yet powerful  great dryer  works great cools itself down would buy again my first hairdryer  so i don t have much to compare it to  but it works great for me  got it for wife to replace old hair dryer she had and she loves it don t have to sit in one spot  great air pressure great dryer  it is very powerful and gets my hair dry much faster than my old one  this is a great product  it s bulky  but you can hang it it works  but for all of the advertising hoopla  i don t think it s that different  like it  very durable  it won t dry your hair really quickly but that is good for your hair  i like this hair dryer and can t believe the price for such a great quality dryer   highly recommend   way better than anything at walmart or target  love it have had it for 8 months  works great  don t know how it does it  but it dries my hair 3 times faster and with less heat than my old hairdryer  not disappointed  very good so far so good   dries my hair without any frizz  is lightweight and not noisy   comes with a nice 4 year warranty  i bought remington ac2015 tstudio salon collection pearl ceramic hair dryer almost a years ago  02 august 2014   and it is a great hair dryer   definitely a 5 stars  br    br   both i and my husband  and occasionally our dog  have been using this hair dryer on a daily basis   we re among those people who always dry their hair   and it still works perfectly  br   i am quite picky when it comes to hair dryer  i like them to be powerful enough to dry my hair quickly  but i also want them to be gentle not to kill my hair  the remington ac2015 does its job nice and quickly  br    br   i have long  almost waist length   thick  and very straight hair  i wash them every 2 3 days using natural products  lush shampoo and conditioner   and also oil them a couple times a week  jojoba oil   either rosemary or lavender essential oil   i use a wooden brush   but only when they re dry  so yes  i really love and care for my hair  but when it comes to drying them  i can t imagine to spend a lot of time doing it  my drying routine is simple  1  i remove most of the water with a towel  gently  and use my fingers to remove tangles  2  then i blow dry my hair upside down  3  finally  i brush them  the whole procedure takes me approx  15 minutes  using the maximal power  level 3  and heat  again 3  of the hair dryer  br    br   my husband has way shorted and fewer hair than i do  straight and thin  he uses my same shampoo and conditioner  but won t do anything more than that  he wouldn t need to use a hair dryer  but love the feeling  it takes him less than a minute to be perfectly dry  br    br   my dog is a scottish terrier   so she s small but has longish and super thick fur  we wash her in the bathtub with natural castille soap  to dry her fur  we first wrap her in a towel  and remove most of the water  then we use the hair dryer alternating medium heat  level 2  and cold air to avoid burning her skin  when she starts being somewhat dryer  we use her brush to attack the most hidden hair  e g  armpits   it takes us approx  1 hour  br    br   to sum up  this hair dryer is durable and high quality   a great bang for the buck  amazon here says i ve been using this since september of 2011  wow  well  i still love it  has all the low to high  hot to cool options i need  i have no complaints about this and i would definitely buy it again if something were to happen to it  br   great purchase  br      love this dryer  i bought one for my daughter because she wanted mine  i love everything about this hairdryer   it is smaller  quieter  hangs on the wall and i just plain love it  works great but a little heavy  love this hair dryer becuse its small and powerful  excellent product  we purchased this blow dryer in 2009 and it is still going strong  good hair dryer especially for the price   great  i love conair products  i never had any issue with conair products in past and i will keep on buying it in future  i bought this one for my mom because of its size  its small  light and folds inside which is good for travelling purpose  my mom loved the size and color  the noise from the dryer is not loud  lasted about a year   i m back to remington  i used remington hair dryers for years and they last the longest   just bought a new  20 00 one at walmart and even it has a  2 year guarantee on it  love it   drys hair fast   no frizz   i actually love how this dryer performs but it looses its motor and heat too quickly  had to send back to the manufacturer within 4 months already once and doing the same thing again i like it   it dries my hair pretty quickly and i have long hair  there s a learning curve with this dryer  what i ve learned  br    br   1  don t dry your hair all the way  if it s curly  the frizz will erase all the work you just did  br   2  place your hair cradled in the dryers teeth and then turn it on  hold for as long as you need  then turn the dryer off before moving to a new section  any time this dryer is not full of hair and right up next to your scalp  it s making a frizz mess  br   3  after drying 75  of the way  stop and clip up your roots to avoid flat head  i find that the hair next to my scalp is still a little damp and susceptible to flatness  br    br   it s a fine dryer  and i use it occasionally when i m in a hurry  but for curly hair  i m a 2c 3a with fine hair  i find it s always best to air dry  great product  first used this hairdryer model in a hotel room last fall and loved it  my own hairdryer finally gave out so i had the opportunity to buy this  very happy with it  retraction of the cord works very well compared to my previous one  and i feel like i have less frizz after drying my hair with this one  probably because it has the diffuser at the end  even on the highest setting it s not too hot  love it excellent travel dryer for our european trip   the only downside is that when used with higher voltage you can only use one setting   the low setting is high at 220v  but it worked well for our purposes   i recommend this highly  great product and super fast delivery  very cool really great gets very hot this hair dryer is by far the best one that i have ever owned  the price was definitely right  i love how quiet it is compared to other hair dryers that i have owned  it has three heat settings and three speed settings along with the cool button that you can press to get a blast of cool air  it dries my hair a lot faster than other hair dryers and it leaves my hair feeling softer than when i dry it with other hair dryers  i would definitely recommend this to others  bought this to replace the exact same model for my wife that was 10 years old    it s a good product    works really good and easy to store    it was nice while the retractable cord worked  but that stopped working after 2 months  now i have to stand right next to the outlet because the cord won t pull out  just wht i was looking for  great product  i love it one of the best  my girlfriend has had this for 3 days  so obviously comments on longevity can t be included  it works well  light  cute colors  can t complain  i love this  not only does it take way less time to dry my hair this way when i m in a hurry  but it makes my hair voluminous and wavy instead of flat and oily and curly in all the wrong places  there s a bit of frizz but it s not bad compared to what i ve experienced at the hands of a regular hair dryer  amazing product for a curly haired girl  this is my second one as the first one got a short in it   i love not having the hairdryer laying out in the way   it helps keep my bathroom organized all ok i ve had this blow dryer for probably a little longer than a year and i absolutely love it  it s blow power is incredibly strong compared to most dryers  think hurricane vs gentle breeze   of course  you can use the low setting which is powerful too but if you want to dry your hair fast  this dryer will not disappoint  it also heats up quickly  cools down quickly  comes with several attachments  and has a long cord  the only downside is that i don t like where the buttons are because the way i hold it to dry my hair  many times  i accidentally turn the heat onto cool without meaning to  i would buy this a thousand times over  the hair dryer actually worked great for a few months but after using the cool button the other day it will not blow any warm air  great dryer  we like it very much  i waited until i used the hair dryer for a couple months before writing a review   i have medium length hair and dry my hair about 4 days a week   so far this hair drying has held up very well   it s light weight and is actually a little quieter than my previous revlon hair dryer that died after 10 years of use   i don t use the diffuser because it doesn t do a thing for my board straight hair   for the money this is an excellent dryer  this dryer does its job well and is convenient to use   they really should consider changing the elastic in the bonnet to a string that is more adjustable  the elastic was so tight that i cut it out and restrung it with a shoelace  there would have been no way i could have fit rollers in it without doing that  the first time i used it  i cut it on high and the motor popped  dries hair quickly without getting too hot  works fine    couldn t be better our clients love it  it has a quality look to it  great hair dryer  just the right speed and temperature to do your hair  best hair dryer i have owned  beats out the dryers i have paid almost  200 for  just got this blow dryer   it doesn t blow as hot as i expected it to heat up   just used it to style my hair   but is definitely better than the ones you d find a walmart  etc   my hair is relaxed and tends to absorb a lot of water   i will post an update later with additional feedback    dries fast and a bit quieter then my old dryer   because of the wider nozzle its seems like less air  but the dry time for my hair is the same   perfectly happy with my new dryer  great love it i bought this for a friend as a gift she  loves it she has her own shop   the best does the job for a great price    i love my new blow dryer  it does not dry out my hair  perfect  thanks works great  good price  just as described so far works great  love this dryer  great feature at a great price good item   excellent product  small but very powerful  great buy great the hair dryer is smaller than my regular dryer but bigger than i would have liked  it gets the job done and i like that it folds in half  this hair dryer is very powerful and dries quickly  well worth the money  i m growing super long hair and this makes my hair so soft and shiny  i should have discovered this earlier  reliable  reasonably loud  and lasts long  i used conair before and those malfunction super easily  i love this hair dryer   using the attached comb makes it very easy to dry my hair  two thumbs up  nice hair dryer  i don t have to flip my head upside down to use it  this is the first 1 star review i have ever written  this blow dryer worked fine for 18 months  however i heard a shriek upstairs when my wife was drying her hair  she said it was on fire and she had unplugged it  i could smell the burning smell  later that day i started wondering why it hadn t blown a breaker and decided that possible lint had accumulated and touched the burner wire  i did clean out some lint and turned on the dryer to see if i had solved problem  no   after about 10 seconds smoke came out  there was a burning smell  and the handle got hot  obviously this is the last of this product for us  the warranty is out by 6 months and if it had just quit working that is one thing  but this is a safety issue and the product should be recalled  nothing too special here   okay hair dryer  my old hair dryer quit on me   so this one has been used since the day it arrived   i love it  and it does a great job of blowing my hair dry  this conair hair dryer works great  it runs smooth and quieter than my last hair dryer  an old remington   the cord retracts nicely into the handle when finished  i recommend this item  truly a great dryer  i ordered one for my mother  who then ordered one for her sister  so naturally i had to have one of my own  significantly reduces flat iron time  i took a star because the brush attachment does not stay on properly  it comes off the dryer once or twice while i m using it  i have a had an issue in the past with most style dryers tripping the gfci outlet  but have not had an issue with this one  amazing  absolutely love this blow dryer  very quick dey time and makes my hair soft and shiney  good love it  highly recommend it  i love this hair dryer     i can t remember the last time my hair looked so shiny and smooth after blow drying it  i am so glad i spent a little more and got a quality hair dryer finally  i can t believe how great my hair looks after just one use  i will update my review if necessary  but if my results continue it won t be necessary  highly recommend this awesome dryer   nice hair dryer  mounted on the wall  clearing counter space and easily acceptable   varied during speed    great little hairdryer  did not meet expectations   returning for refund   the motor is quiet but it takes a longer time to dry hair and then the hair is fly away    not what i wanted at all  exactly what was described is exactly what i needed  working great  this is a great blowdryer to take traveling  has full power in a compact size  handle folds up nicely  used it in france wth an adapter  great for travel with lots of power and heat  my first one lasted 20 years  i ordered this to replace it  works great  easy to use  lightweight and not too noisy compared to others  the included attachments are great  good  but loud i love this blowdryer   it has a very powerful flow of air which is excellent for straight hair like mine  comes with all standard attachments and i think would be great for any type of hair  excellent quality for the price  i have had mine for over a year now and it still works like it is brand new  love it   i ordered two   works great  small  lightweight  easy to handle   like the long cord and the cool shot button  product excelent  arrive in condiction good  thanks works better than my more expensive dryers  i love this hair dryer  used it today and it was amazing  i have thick hair and it dried it so quickly  and i used no products today and my hair is so so silky    normally it takes quite a while to dry my hair and i use 2 products plus a smoothing serum at the end  this was amazing   great dryer and a long cord too   love it     powerful and easy to pack on domestic trip      very pleased   folds nicely  cord retracts well  love it but the watts are so high that it keeps blowing fuses all the time    this dryer is what i wanted at a reasonable price  it was easy to put on the wall  like it  it is pretty powerful  took on vacation and use it in my rv too  i absolutely love my blow dryer  it s not crazy hot to the point of burning my head but it still dries my locks   all 3 5 feet of it  i love this hair dryer   i like that it dries my hair super fast and it is super light to hold   the curved handle makes it easy to hold   great price  too  love it   so convenient  great product  ordered and choose two day shipping and it arrived in one day  used this product same day and got excellent results with a protein treatment i was doing  good product     recommended nice weight and power  best hair dryer i ve ever owned  i have really thick hair so i needed a professional grade dryer  it drugs my hair very quickly  i would it like more if i could control the intensity and temperature of the dryer it blows   hot   really well   amazing stamina   plug it in and it never stops   not expensive  best hair dryer ever   quite heavy if that is an issue   i love it  great hairdryer  does what it needs to  love it  very convenient  i was thrilled when i got a hotel room and they had this hair dryer in the bathroom  i was very excited when i saw it available on amazon  i really didn t think it would work as well as the ones in the hotel as i figured there s was a commercial grade  i was pleasantly surprised it worked just as well  i get a lot of compliments on it when i have guests  especially those that forgot to pack one or don t want to go digging for their  it is an excellent idea for bathrooms or teenagers room  my granddaughter has asked for one to put beside her vanity  perhaps santa will provide  i bought this for drying my miniature schnauzer furnishings at home and at shows  i picked this one because it has air coming in from both sides for maximum air flow  it works great  i ve had it for nearly 2 years and use it often as i also groom for a few other owners  it still looks like new and all the switches work just like day one  i will buy again if this one ever goes out  i will also buy another one if my personal hair dryer  different brand  ever goes out  i ve had it for nearly 20 years  lol i purchased this hair dryer after looking without success for one this small in local stores   i have only been using it for about two weeks  and it is meeting all of my expectations thus far   the size and weight are perfect for carrying in my swim bag  taking up much less room that my defunct dryer   a bonus for me was the low noise level of this appliance   i anticipated a loud  high pitched scream  due to the compact size  but it operates with quiet efficiency   i have short hair  and this dryer delivers quick drying at a comfortable sound level with no hassle with easy packability  great but a little on the loud side bit on the noisy side  has more of the high pitch tone that makes it annoying  otherwise  nice and light weight  the unit was cracked in serveral places when i received it  but all in all it worked fairly well  such a great travel hairdryer  also works internationally and is a great size  good product  i guess i ve always been using sub par hair dryers  this one blows them out of the water  pun very much intended  br    br   thank you to everyone else who posted a great review  this is a great one to buy and i m glad i came here to read reviews before i purchased   it s pretty  very powerful  and my only gripe is the buttons are reversed from my last dryer so i m constantly making it hotter instead of turning it off    br    br   10 10 lots of power and easy to use   fit well near my vanity mirror   very pleased  super fast drying love it    drys hair quickly  great product   this is the second one i have bought  to give to my niece as a birthday gift since we love ours so much  compact size makes this hair dryer great and easy to pack for weekend and or longer trips  works very well this hairdryer exceeded my expectations   although it s a bit on the heavy side  its compact frame and powerful air flow fully compensate that one drawback   one of the best hairdryers i have owned  love hair dryer  wish the cord was longer like the original dryer purchased a few years ago   why did they shorten cord   i purchased this to use on a trip to england and ireland  i was very happy with it  it is very small  lightweight  and high powered  i wouldn t want to use to all the time  but i m very happy with it for travel  so happy i finally bought this dryer for my bathroom   it has great power but can be gentle with the lower speed  i have extremely curly hair and this dryer is perfect for me   it s a little loud but worth it  this is a replacement for the one i have had for many years  i really like this dryer  ti does the job well   i have  not used the attachment since i have short hair  so i have to review just the hair dryer alone it s really good  i recommend this one  plenty of choices for air flow  works as a blow drier but not as well as the rv544 for just a little bit more money  fabulous little dryer will never go back to another type  great settings lots of power  hangs out of the way yet right there when you need it  this is the best dyer i have ever used     i have frizzy curly hair and when i use this dyer my hair comes out smooth and straight    great dryer and delivered in just three days bought for my 11 year old daughter  she loves it   the price was just right  and it s simple to use  pretty decent power  and the cold shot button works great without losing power  like some i have owned    would recommend as a great basic hair dryer  great item   quick service  thanks  compact and powerful  travelled to brazil and were a bit afraid that for the value it would actually work well on 220v outlets  but it works great so far  only problem is the attachment is very lose and does not stay on  falling easily and frequently while drying my hair  but still  i recommend it  love the built in nightlight love this dryer   it s quiet but powerful  and the  cold  button really works without losing power   unlike the last dryer i had   other reviewers mentioned it s weight  and yes it does feel more weighty than some dryers  but it s not a problem for me  sorta feels like it s more industrial and not cheap   the outside texture of the dryer is nice too   overall i think it was a great buy  works great   love the retractable cord    it does go back in fast so i hang on the the plug  lightly  until its retracted so the plug doesn t swing around and hit something  this is my second one  the first one has been  broken while moving home  i would say it is a product worth its price  great deal  too loud  all the descriptions about the noise is true  br   and the low setting is too low  i don t write many reviews  but this hair dryer is the absolute best that i have ever owned and very reasonably priced   i live in humid south florida and have shoulder length thick hair that tends to frizz   i have always taken care to dry my hair carefully and thoroughly with a round brush  however  after a stint in the florida heat i am all frizz again   i decided to upgrade my hair dryer and read many reviews before selecting this one   i do have to add that most of the recommended hair dryers were priced well over  50 which just seems like too much to me   the remington ac9096 had both great reviews and a reasonable price and best of all    it works   i can dry my hair very quickly with this dryer using a large round brush and the end result is soft  smooth  shiny  frizz free hair that stays frizz free even when i am outdoors   i have not had any issues with my hair getting caught on the dryer  but like i said   my hair is only shoulder length  if you have hair that tends to frizz in the humidity   buy this dryer   you will not regret it  i bought this hair dryer recently but i ordered a comb attachment and it cannot fit    so i bought another different one that which is bigger and they said was universal an it wont fit either   they both are too small to fit   can anyone tell me a size comb attachment i can buy that would fit on this hair dryer please this blowdryer caused outages each time i used it so i had to stop and buy a new one   pretty good for a home device in addition to being one third the size and significantly lighter than my old dryer  it did the job in half the time of my more powerful unit with the same technology   one other reviewer said that it burnt out after 2 weeks  but if it lasts i would definitely recommend it  i used this hairdryer at a hotel and came home and bought one   it is lightweight  and my favorite feature is that you can have high air with low heat   simple  cheap  and works very well  best hair dryer  same dryer as my hair stylist  it s a good product to buy  it s very useful  good works good and outside stays cool   durable and heats and cools quickly   turbo mode great   be aware this dryer is very large   the plastic hair thingy is a gimmick  but the dryer is good  this dryer works well  i think the temps are perfect for my hair  very fine   my spouse thinks it s not quite hot enough  thick hair   i love the different fan settings on inner handle  the cool button does not change the fan speed  only the temp  i have had this for a few months now  and it really does a nice job  well pleased light weight  dries efficiently  i reall like this dryer  arrived on time   nice  powerful small travel hair dryer  excellent works great great buy   works just as advertised very nice very powerful and i like the folding handle  dries my hair in no time  great hairdryer but i didn t get the round attachment brush and i wanted that  i tried to find a way to let the know but didn t because the writing was asian l will continue to try to order the round attachment this little dryer is really easy to take on the go   it gets really hot  which is good for my incredibly thick hair  but it s great to have the cooling button on it   it is a loud little bugger however   anyway  it s a good purchase   i ve used it several dozen times on trips in the states and in europe and it s served its purpose  small  light in weight   easy to use  it does the job   i love it  very good product  it doesn t seem to get that hot  i don t know if it just needs time to get broken in  or if the infrared technology just doesn t need the high heat  runs very quietly and its built like a tank  it was ok   liked the heaviness of it but was nothing more than just a drugstore blow dryer  was hoping for  more of a difference due to the   34 tourmaline ceramic  34  name but nothing special or different than my last conair blow dryer  its ok    light weight but noisey  nice and does not fry hair  great power  shortened my drying time quite a bit  great wall mount dryer  very good we found this at a local store just looking for a cheep hair dryer  and i have to say that i am incredibly impressed with its performance  we have had this running for a minimum of three hours straight and it hasn t skipped a beat  first time we used it  we forgot to press the cool air button and ended up melting pvc pipe  so as far as heat goes  this thing is awesome  its heat resistance is also pretty impressive  we have had it right up next to  about 1200  f and it kept working  it had a bit of distance from the heat since we connected it to pvc pipe  but the pvc funneled heat right into the dryer when it was off   today we even had it next to about 1300  f and not a thing went wrong  so all in all we have ran this in pretty intense environments and it hasn t failed us yet  we ve ran it 4 times like this and it was able to preform perfectly each time  only problem we had was that at around hour 2 the first time we used it  the back started to smoke  we thought that maybe we had bought a cheep dryer and that we d need a different one  but soon after it stopped and hasn t done it since  we were using it in a small drizzle which might impact performance  so don t use it for 2 hours in a slight drizzle  once it started really raining  we moved into a garage and continued using it  and after that it stopped smoking  but all in all i d say that it is a very good purchase for a low price  once ours busts i will most likely purchase another revlon  love this dryer  had it for a couple of years and it s still going strong  powerful and hot  i love it  i love this hairdryer  it has a lot of power and i like that it has three heat settings as well as two fan settings    it is not too loud and not too heavy  love this hair dryer for the price  very happy with this hair dryer  and the price   i have baby fine hair  and i m able to dry it without leaving it all frizzy   i clung to my 1500 watt blowdryer for years  until it finally died  since the 1800 watt dryers i d tried had all given me dismal results   maybe it s the ceramic that makes the difference   but in any event i am pleased with this purchase  just as fast drying as promised   glad for the force choices   the high speed seems to tangle my straight bob fit right where the old dyers was mounted  great replacement for a reasonable cost  the dryer has several good features  and i especially appreciate the cool setting and how the cool button delivers air with absolutely no heat at all   other dryers i ve had have produced still slightly warm heat even when the cool button is used   not this one      the downside for this dryer is the diffuser attachment   it is much too small and does not diffuse well enough to not have my fine 2 b c wavy hair not blow all over   luckily i was able to use a diffuser attachment from my dryer that fried recently  prompting this purchase    otherwise i would have had to return this dryer  even as much as i m loving the cool air feature   hence only a three star rating  wow   honestly  i was a bit skeptical about whether there would be any difference between this hairdryer and the  20 ones i have been using my whole life   i couldn t be more wrong   this dryer is truly head and shoulders above anything i ve tried before   please read on to hear about the technology  results and how to properly use this should you be convinced to take the plunge  br    br   the technology br   rather amazing technology here from the engineers at panasonic   using a high electric potential they create negative ions which trap water molecules from the air and combine them with the hot air jet of a conventional dryer   by doing this  they buffer the air jet with moisture which in turn prevents damage to hair   panasonic has been leaders in this area of technology which is why japan enjoys the best selection of such hair dryers  br    br   the results br   as other reviewers have pointed out  hair is dried quicker and with softer  shinier results   my hair is short  but for most women with longer hair  the results should be even better   it is designed to run cooler to protect hair from heat  so if you dry your hair everyday you would significantly reduce cumulative damage to hair  br    br   before you use  br   you must be aware of the electrical requirements for using this fine hair dryer   since it was designed for the japanese domestic market  it is made for their electrical system  not the u s   although the plugs in japan and the u s  look the same  the electricity supply is very different   i am an electrical engineer and i have lived in japan  continue to use many japanese products in the u s  so i understand the differences well and how to work around them   in japan they use 100 volts  however in the u s  we use 120 volts   that means by plugging in a japanese product directly into the u s  system  you would overload the product by 20    for a high wattage device like a hair dryer that is a considerable amount over the intended design   indeed some other reviewers have posted pictures of melted dryers and claimed they were defective   however  if properly used this should not happen   in fact  i noticed that when i use mine  the hair dryer itself stays quite cool  br    br   see my pictures below which show the electric sticker saying 100v  if it were ok for u s  it would have a range that included 120v    i have also posted 2 pictures of my dryer plugged in to a transformer   note the first one with the power off  my voltage reader measures 105volts  this is close enough to 100v    the second one has the power on  and it is consuming 1148 watts    that is more than many microwaves  so you can imagine with 20  overload why people were experiencing bad smells  melting and early failure   br    br   i warn that a proper stepdown transformer  capable of at least 1200 watts minimum for this dryer  will be expensive   but used within its capacity will last forever   i personally recommend japanese made transformers from companies such as sanyo  nissyo or toyozumi   i have heard poor quality control on chinese made ones  so given the high cost of the dryer  or any other japanese product you would consider  i e  panasonic nanocare steamer  i would invest in the best transformer   furthermore  i would not hesitate to purchase a japanese transformer used on ebay as these are very durable items and you can often get a great deal  they come up from time to time   br    br   5 stars   when used properly will provide incredibly healthy looking hair d

nightlite good so far good when working   cord broke at handle in a few months like most reviews i have the same comments   a little heavy but doesn t really bother me   i wish there was a removable grill screen on the back to prevent hair from getting in   i like that it isn t too loud   it is a good hair dryer and a decent price  another great product  you have many settings available to you and the retractable cord is a real bonus  i hang my blow dryer in a over the door hair product caddy   and it s much easier to close the cabinet door now without a cord getting in the way  i have very fine  short hair and this dryer fluffed it up nicely and it s very fast  perfect size for the small suitcase i had to use for a trip to italy   it has good power and works well  i had high hopes for this dryer based on the reviews  but it s marginal at best   the heat setting is pretty weak  and if you have a ton of hair  forget about it   for me  i ll keep using it  but my wife said she d never be able to use this on a daily basis  pros   saves room on the counter  compact size  hi setting is strong  br    br   cons   it only lasted two years and one month   had to re order one again today because we had already installed the metal panel on the wall and didn t want to have to take it off and repaint and redo it all  br    br   hopefully this new one will come soon and last longer  we shall see    overall a great hair dryer  but since the outer shell along with attachable head nozzles are plastic  it can emit a somewhat funky smell if left on for too long and on too high of a temperature  i usually have to take my full size      hair dryer on vacation because the ones at hotels are wimpy  i decided to research smaller hair dryers   this one looked great  i just tried it today   to my surprise  i liked it   it dried just as fast as my full size dryer  malfunctioned   ordered this blowdryer in march 2015 for occasional use at home  i am a guy with short hair   so i barely use it daily    it malfunctioned only three months later in june 2015   i was drying my hair one morning and flames shot from the dryer at my head   i did not get burned  nor did my hair  but it was pretty surreal to see the dryer nearly on fire   unfortunately  they are no longer available   i have no way to contact the seller and so i am stuck buying another dryer  i have included a picture to show the extent of the glowing fire at the end of this dyer   buy this allure hair dryer at your own risk   if the seller reads this review   i would appreciate being contacted for replacement   thanks  like it but the cord needs assistance retracting and could have more power  works like a professional hair dryer should  good product works excellently   can easily clean out the air intake grill work   only wish the mounting to the wall plate was more secure  nice cheap dryer  great product for a great value  honestly was worried about the price point at first but it was a good buy    nice  sturdy good quality   haven t used it yet but plugged it in and waited a while for it to get hot but had to turn it off before it actually produced real heat  i got this hair dryer to replace a dryer i had for several years   this one is really good   it provides a good flow of air and has 3 different heat settings and speed settings  i would recommend it  perfect great price  my wife and i needed a new hair dryer  and we had good luck with conair in the past  so i thought i would try this new model which was just introduced   works really great  and much much quieter than the old one  too   absolutely would recommend it   5 stars  best blow dryer i have ever owned  loved the solid feel and design  wow bought a new hair dryer a few years ago and it stopped working  wow they just don t make them like they used to  br   previous hair dryer lasted 10  years   but this one is wonderful  noise level is pleasant  lightweight for this 110 pound girl  br   love the heat options  does a wonderful job  i hope it lasts  great dryer wife thinks this thing is the best dryer she s ever had   claims it drys her hair quickly without leaving all the static  i wouldn t know since i m bald but i m glad i bought it for her  my wife loves it  a great mothers day present perfect for air travel as is compact and fits in my cloth bag love that it has the diffuser  great dryer works fast and has a long cord so you can move around  works great   the 2 nozzles come on and off fine   much lighter than my previous dryer  good dryer but the buttons aren t easy to move  i ve never had it in me to buy an expensive blow dryer  so i m no expert on dryers  but i m very satisfied with this one  very powerful and  you can t beat the price i love it good  but ony lasted a year   didn t re purchase  going back to remington  great product  the retractable cord is really nice  the air does not add static to the hair  i wish it came in other color options  i have long  fine  and straight hair and this has turned out to be my go to dryer  it gets hot enough but not too hot  it is perfect for styling  very happy with it  loved it  broke after a year excellent great buy nice blow dryer so far had about a month blows very strong and gets pretty hot i have long very frizzy hair and blows it straight with a round brush pretty quickly  br   it s pretty heavy but i don t mind the weight  4 stars due to nozzle falls off if you don t push it in tight ever time you use it but other than that no complaints  i love it  it s not as strong as i expected  but my hair dries super fast  this is by far the best blow dryer i have ever owned   i have longer thick hair and this dryer cuts my hair styling time in half  light weight and easy to use  the only thing i would change is maybe the location of the switches  i find myself hitting the switches to easily when styling my hair  excellent great hair dryer and so easy to install  good power and nicely styled  exactly what i wanted  excellent dryer  brush too soft  gave it away  not 100  as powerful as my old hair dryer  but its so compact and gets the job done   my hair feels a lot softer and not burnt  so the lower heat seems to be fine   ive only had it a month  so i cant say how long the cord retract works   for  20  if it lasts a year its better than the competition   i was looking at other hair dryers  and 10  more  20  more   didnt seem to be much of a difference   not until you go to  100   and when your comparing a 100  hair dryer to a 20  one  the 20  one is the hairdryer to go with   update  retractable cord doesn t always fully retract  still works fine  i would have liked an easier to clean one but this works  i use my shop vac to demolish the lint in the rear fan  for the price it s still a good bargain  powerful and not expensive  it s the perfect size love it if i had only known what a difference a hair dryer can make for your hair  i admit that i love to buy beauty products  but especially hair products  my hair is colored highlighted  fairly straight  but not thin  lately i keep buying products to take the dry frizz that seems to appear on the ends of my hair  little did i know that using the conair tourmaline hair dryer would solve that problem immediately  the dryer has settings for the usual hot cold warm settings and high medium low   but it s nice to have the controls slide on either side of the device  it s a powerful 1875 watts that dries my hair faster with ions and gives it body plus takes away the dry ends almost 100   my co workers noticed my hair looking better too  ironically  i don t always use a blow dryer because i want healthy hair  but this dryer seems to make my hair look better  for the price and function  i recommended this dryer  the wife loves it    the night light is bright  but not harsh  first discovered this brand of hairdryer at a hotel that my husband and i stayed at and loved so much that when we got home i went online to find one   it is made very well  a little more expensive than what you would pay for one from walmart but that was okay with me   i haven t always had good luck in the past with hairdryers but i think i ll have this andis for a long time  ive had this blow dryer for a little while now maybe a month    great temp and powerful but it whistles and rattles as if something is loose inside    i like this hair dryer  it has good functions available and it blows good  quiet heat  although it s a bit heavy to hold   works really well  my hair is short but it did what i wanted it to do   good investment  perfect  just as described  i bought this dryer for travel and it is perfect   plenty of power and folds up br   for easy packing  this hair drying is great for travel  perfect size  amazing at first  it gave me natural flawless curls but after a month of using it  it stopped working  i had to re place it  good quality and value i love it bought this in 2013   loved it  worked great   all of a sudden stopped working   contacted seller and they said because it was 2 years ago  they wouldn t replace it   not sure i would spend the money again  considering it broke after 2 years  excellent 100  hair dryer works perfectly highly reccomend great dryer  easy to put on wall  very happy with it  nice nite lite  love this dryer   i specifically chose it because it is not as loud as others  just okay    doesnt seem to have a strong blowing power  and the on off switch is located on the handle right where you hold it which makes it turn off when you are using it  the filter door keeps popping open too    i kept it  but not all that thrilled with it  this is perfect for travel   it is the smallest dryer i have seen  but it s power is not diminished  this hair dryer was all it was advertised to be   it is very easy to use and light weight  worth the money and good quality no issues great product favorite hairdryer  too loud and the kind of thick  and for the price i would expect more  the perfect pink dryer   i love it  thank you  i bought this hair dryer after having it in my hotel room in disney  i was using it and was really impressed with the speed at which is dried  the fullness of my hair and also the weight of the machine  love the retractable cord  my hair is very fine and fly away  especially in the humid weather  my style held even in the florida heat  so  i came home and ordered one  love it  this is a replacement of the same blow dryer that i had purchased based on a recommendation from a magazine  the blow dryer is very light and had good power but failed completely in less than 2 months  i have had the replacement for 3 wks now and there are times the motor slows and i think it too is going to stop completely  love this dryer   i have been looking for this old style dryer like my aunt used when she was a stylist   always loved it great to find one works wonderfully  good great quality great when traveling  the right size to carry in your luggage  works well  folds easily  very handy for travel  had another one for many years and it very stopped working   was stolen from our van during a cross country trip   would absolutely buy it again  the highest speed is great  even though i have short hair i m sure anyone with long hair would find this dryer quick  a solid hairdryer   not high end  but perfect for the price  i really like the hair dryer  the cool switch is great  in other hair dryer i had to hold down the cold button  does its job  excellent i love this hair dryer  it dries my hair quickly  and my hair dries very smooth and soft  i had an issue with the cord of mine not staying locked  but i was able to easily exchange it for the same hair dryer which did not have the locking problem  must have been a fluke  but it was very easy to return  still works great but all the graphics came off within a week  if you have any product on your hands  expect the same results  good hairdryer for the price  some hair dryers really make my color treated hair look dry and frizzy  this one works well with my hair type to keep it looking smoother than the average dryer  nice blow dryer   comes with a comb too  which is what i needed   i love it  perfect dryer for travel or home use   powerful and lightweight  really good quality  l liked it so much l bought 4  works great  hook for cord is a nice plus love it  we were looking for a good quality  simple hair drier  this one seemed to fit the bill  br   it works well  dries hair quickly  and seems to help tame the   34 frizzies   34  we have been using it for quite a while now  and have had absolutely no issues with it  thanks my wife really likes this dryer  we would like panasonic extended warranty  excellent  best blowdryer i have ever owned  well worth the money  i love this hair drywr   at 1600 watts it dries my hair rapidly   it s compact size makes it lighter and easier to handle than those bulky dryers that must be held foot away from the head   this is a real plus for folks with arthritis in the shoulder or neck joints  it fits easily into a drawer in the bathroom and it doesn t take up much room in a suitcase for travel   this is my second hair dryer of this type    the first one was purchased several years ago  and it still works perfectly even after 4 5 years of nearly daily use   this unit was purchased as a replacement for a similar 1200 watt dryer  different brand  that i kept in my swimming bag but that finally stopped working after 30 years  absolutely love this  dries hair quickly without burning my hair  powerful and fast drying girlfriend loves it  not too hot for hwr hair  does a great job  great prpduct for the price i bought 3 hair dryers at local stores and returned all three    just not what i wanted   i kept looking at the rimini 1800w tourmaline ionic ceramic on amazon    it was the color that caught my eye first    that beautiful blue   after i returned the third dryer  i came back to the rimini 1800w   i liked the way the dryer angled down  the controls looked high enough up so i wouldn t be changing the settings  and i especially loved the color   well  don t let the color sway you   i ordered the dryer  and it s fabulous   it s full sized  powerful  quiet  and my fingers don t continually change the settings   it takes me about 4 minutes to completely dry my shoulder length  straight hair  and that s at medium heat  high power   i m so pleased with this hair dryer  and did i mention that i love the beautiful blue color  i typically never write reviews  but felt compelled to after using this amazing product  my hair has never felt so good after using this dryer  it dries quickly and i barely needed to flat iron my hair when finished  my hair withstood the humidity better than ever as well  my hair is colored  blonde to boot   damaged  wavy and frizzy and it honestly felt like a pantene commercial after one use  i am a lifer with this hair dryer and thinking of buying a few to have back ups  thank you babyliss for making my hair the best it has ever been  a huge step up from the one it replaced   feels solid and works great  i ve had this hair dryer for almost 4 years now  and to this day i love it  i have dry  frizzy  hermione granger esqe hair so i needed something that wouldn t feel like i m frying it  i highly  highly recommend it to everyone  it comes with a diffuser which i only used like once or twice but it s ok  i m gonna have this one for awhile  i love the sleek design too  i don t see it becoming outdated like those pink and green hair dryers from the 70s or something  thanks scientists at conair  i salute you  very nice hair dryer  my favorite thing is that you push down the on off button and heat controls  you don t slide it as with my last dryer  important when you are drying hair  for several children and may have lotion on your hands etc    works well  looks good  nice controls  i am happy with it  i don t think it works any differently than my last ionic hair dryer  in terms of controlling frizz on my naturally curly hair  but it works equally well at a minimum  best hair dryer i have ever purchased   i have always bought the high end expensive hair dryers  but this one far exceeds any dryer i have bought   not too hot  light weight and my hair is dryer in 5 minutes less than my last hair dryer   i m very happy with my purchase  best wall mounted hair dryer i have owned   love it  because of the placement on the blower  it takes up more space than i anticipated   it does the job  i love this hairdryer  purchased it for a trip abroad but my gym dryer   34 died  34  last week so started using this one and even though it is more compact  it dries my hair quickly  the dual voltage is a plus  very pleased with the purchase  purchased this without much research  so i am to blame for not   34 loving  34  this   it s heavy  loud and i prefer more ranges in heat than it offers   the attachments work well   it s mid sized  so if you re wanting something light and small  this isn t it   mid sized and heavy      i would not buy again  great mini dryer with plenty of power  only problem is that it s loud on high setting  better price than walmart  can t live without it  fits my t3 micro  model  53888 r  the barrel of the dryer is slightly less than 2 inches in diameter  push in and twist  it will latch and stays on perfectly  this is a great value and works well  it is the 2nd one i have purchased  love it  i bought this hair dryer probably 3 years ago and never got around to posting a review  this hair dryer is fantastic  i have had it for 3 years or so and i have never had a problem or malfunction  it drys my hair fast and reduces frizz  i will always buy elchim  i thought the button issue that everyone else wrote about would escape me  nope  almost every time i dry my hair i hit the temp or speed button    at least 2 3 times  it s does a great job drying but the buttons cause just enough nuance that i would recommend to keep looking  i like it but can t wait for it to break and find a new hair dryer  love it  great dryer  enough power  that i use not just for travel   only problem is the cord is very short so you have to be fairly close to the outlet when you use it   if they would make the cord longer  it would be perfect   i also used it when i was in italy with no problems  although you do need an adapter but the converter is built in   it took me waaay too long to find a hair dryer that i didn t think was going to start a fire or ruin my hair  i decided on this despite some bad reviews  and am glad that i did  it s pretty  i know this isn t important to some people   and it dries really well  i haven t had any problems with it and love the accessories that came with it  blows air way too hot   it actually burned my hair   i previously had another blow dryer the same brand and was perfect   i m not sure if it s this one that s defective of they just don t make them like before  i heat style pretty frequently and unfortunately burn out a lot of hair dryers  i haven t invested in a more expensive one and i may not need to  this baby is enduring through my blowouts  the ion technology is fantastic   it leaves my hair soft and smooth  with regular cleaning this has lasted longer than any other one i owned and really is keeping my hair in good shape  it s a great supplemental dryer as well and the coating is easy to grip along with a nice  light weight  great dryer   lightweight and easy to handle   great heat and cool features  it is lightweight as promised   the handle folds up easily  i actually like this blow dryer very much  it makes my hair very smooth and silky  and i don t have a problem with the settings or placement of the switches  as others have stated  i would recommend this blow dryer to anyone  a great addition to my hair styling toolbox   dries my hair in about 7 minutes   love the different settings and the extra part for directing the air to go where you want it  wonderful product   excellent service   thank you  good product  works just fine  i have purchased many blow dryers and this one has been my favorite  fast shipping  great product  no issues  arrived on time  not as heavy or as cumbersome to hold while drying hair  it is however  a large hairdryer and not compact for travel purposes  doesn t dry br     frizz  my hair as much as non  ionic dyers  love all the settings  several useful attachments were included  you can find a lower price elsewhere without the attachments  amazing hair dryer  over all great product  it s stylish  light weight  easy to use and hold  very strong and powerful air power for being such a small blow dryer  you have all the functions like hot and cool  high and low  the black handle has glitter in it and it sparkles in the light lol  all in all this is a great blow dryer and even better price  it is a good quality product  i have been using it since 2013 and it is working perfectly  however  i do not blow dry my hair everyday  i only use it occasionally  haven t used that often  because it s summer  but the few times that i did there was a burning smell coming from the dryer   would not recommend using for long period of time   better yet  find another hair dryer for better overall quality and purpose   good luck  works great  fast shipping  thanks this hair dryer is worth every penny  i read an article by a top hair stylist who recommended this dryer   so when my over  100 infrared hair dryer broke after one year  i decided to give this one a try  i m so glad i did because not only is it light weight  it cut my drying time down  and it helped smooth out my hair  i never knew a dryer could do that  especially when all my other dryers would leave my natural curly hair looking frizzy  does what it is supposed to do  could maybe blow air a little stronger but otherwise  a perfectly good hair dryer  comes with a diffuser and a concentrator  that i will never use     light weight and just the right amount of heat this small conair 1875 will always be my favorite hair dryer  it is compact and easy to handle  i hope they never quit making this model  works great it is lightweight   has 3 heat settings   i love the 2 attachments  very good works great   very good product to much noise but does the work  perfect when it works right it is my dream blowdryer   yes  the br   controls can easily get flipped around  but the temp and br   air flow is ideal for those of us with super fine  and fragile br   curly hair   whatever they are doing to these ion hairdryers br   is nothing desirable for me   they always frizz me out  br     i use the high heat high speed setting with the hot air br   pik to straighten and volumize my hair  or use round brushes br   and vary the heat along each section of hair   no matter how br   i style it  i come out with much shinier less frizzy hair  br   rewind about 2003 2004  bought this model in a store  br   loved it  and used it til it died in about 2007  bought br   another from a different store   everything was fine at first  br   then when i would use it the breaker would trip   at first br   it only happened once or twice  which is just one of those br   things that can happen for no good reason   i bought another br   after the electrician ok d everything   i figured it was just a br   bad dryer   so i bought one more from a different store  br   worked fine until it sparked and a flame came out the end  br   after a burned hand i decided i should try and find another br   dryer   around 2012 i was talking to a friend who works in br   the salon industry and she told me the company that made br   my favorite dryer had changed the way they made them  br   that made me think it was worth one last shot   i have moved br   from where i used all my other dryers   first couple dries went br   great   however  i don t trust it not to use it in a non gfci br   outlet   last couple times i used it the gfci activated and br   turned it off   now i m convinced it is a safety hazard  or br   at the very least a challenge the electrical system doesn t br   need   i m heartbroken over that   if the manufacturer could br   address that problem  i would be so happy  br   the seller on amazon was reasonably priced and got my br   item to me quickly and ingood condition  night light too bright very happy with this hair dryer very good great heat control i usually cut corners with this stuff  this is still a cheap dryer  but it s very good quality  the matte look is nice  has three settings for heat and three settings for how much air is pushed  plus the cool button  it s worked great for half a year now  if it broke i d buy another one  for an inexpensive hair dryer  this thing was pretty amazing  lasted almost a year and a half with regular use  love the light weight and ease to hold   big dryers are too heavy for me   good strong blow power and fast drying love love love good for my hair good works as expected fast delivery certainly outperforms my current blow dryers  the immediate difference is the drying time  i wouldn t say it halves the time it takes to dry my hair  but it makes a noticeable difference  it s also relatively quieter than my other blow dryers  though as soon as you use the   34 turbo   34  it gets louder  i certainly wouldn t call it a quiet blow dryer  but it is more comfortable to use  one odd thing  though  it seems to have a lot of suction  it s the only one that sticks to my shirt if i get it too close   but not a very strong air flow output for the amount it seems to be drawing in  br    br   4 stars so far because it s about its price  outperforms my current blow dryers but not by a significant margin  i ve also read numerous reviews that this doesn t have a great product life  so i m waiting to see about that  great item we love this unit nite light too  great product   worked awesome in london and scotland while using a universal all in one interantional travel power plug adapter  the best dryer ever     i love this dryer  it works great and it is quiet i bought my first one four months ago and returned it because it was shooting sparks after two months   i thought it was an anomaly and bought a second one like a ding dong when first one was shot and it caught on f i r e  yesterday   f i r e   really  revlon  i love this blow dryer  i love that there is a medium setting   i love this small and easy to carry hair dryer  ideal for traveling  i will use amazon for all my shopping in the future because they provide excellent service  already had one  bought this 2nd one for the other bathroom  great product  recently purchased this again to replace a unit in our bathroom that has been there at least 6 years  and     that unit still runs but the thermocouple switch that shuts the unit off when it overheats has   34 worn  34  over the years and has begun to engage a little too quickly   note that not keeping the lint filter clean will cause this issue as well  due to restricted airflow over the thermocouple   br    br   indeed  a pretty darn good unit for the money  after a couple of years of use  literally  used hundreds of times in that period  the   34 ears  34  or   34 fingers  34  that hold the dryer became worn  or loose  so the hairdryer would fall out  this was solved by placing a strip of velcro on the inside of each   34 ear  34    would have given product 5 stars if this had not occurred  found that this easy   34 repair  34  needs to be repeated every couple of years  br    br   from my experience  definitely would not hesitate to recommend  conjecture is that those who experienced short life with this appliance may not have cleaned the lint filter as often as required  from personal experience i know it s easy to put this little chore off  if you have had this product only a few months and you start experiencing the unit shutting off before your hair is dry   this is the thing to check  love it  the power  the light weight  the settings   especially easy to pack because it folds up  i have fibromyalgia and my hands sometimes will not let me hold things  the grip on this is easy   it s light weight so it doesn t hurt to hold it when drying my hair  i picked this up on lightening deal as i needed a new blow dryer  it s as good as my last conair but a bit less powerful   which is fine for me because i couldn t use the highest setting on my last one since it blew my hair to much   i have fine hair so it just tangled my hair on the highest setting  i love the retractable cord  it s so nice  excellent hair dryer      been using this twice daily for over a year  simple  effective  you don t really need anything more than this to make wet hair dry  my dog would probably give it a 1 star review  but he is biased because he hates hair dryers in general  had this product for several years and wore it out  sure glad it was still available  does the job better than most  excellent dryer   i would recommend it to everyone it s a tad heavier than i would like but i love the retractable cord and the fact that it folds and fits easily in my vanity drawer  it does a great job  excellent  great value  i love to retractable cord  folding aspects of this dryer  i put i d away neatly in a drawer   out of sight   great price for an adequate hair dryer  great diffuser this blowdryer works well although not as powerful as the revlon one i am replacing this with   it dries my hair in a fair amount of time but i miss being able to hold onto the hairdryer and being able to turn it on and off one handed   the curved handle on this does not allow you to do this   other than that i like it and i like the retractable cord although the cord could be a tad longer  awesome good hair dryer   10mins to dry my long hair   i am so happy purchased the onei mk ii to replace my wigo  after purchasing a chi   sedu i was hesitant to purchase the onei  this by far has surpassed my expectations   my experience with the chi   sedu  i need a hairdryer to meet my needs  dry without loss of volume   decrease amount use of root shine styling products  very surprised at how gentle the air flow comes out   how fast my hair dries   i assume it s based on the barrel shape of the onei dryer vs a more cylindrical barrel like some dryers  the packaging of the dryer far exceeded my expectations  the quality of the onei feels looks better than the sedu i purchased months ago  so far very surprised   looking to see if this will outlast my last dryer a wigo 5yrs    i have had this dryer for only a month   have not heard of this brand before  that s why i only gave it a 4  so far loving it better than the sedu   chi  ionizes and retracts  it has great power  omg  i have been looking for this dryer for at least 5 years   after my favorite dryer broke  i looked for one like it that is lightweight  has power but not too much power  and most importantly  has the high low off switch on the back of the dryer handle  not in the front   all of the dryers i have looked at in the past have the switch es  on the front of the handle   this is a problem for me  because when i style my hair with a dryer and a round brush  i have to constantly turn the dryer on and off   with the buttons on the back of the handle like this one  i can turn it on and off with one hand   when the buttons are on the front of the handle  i have to set my brush down to turn it on and off with two hands   what a hassle   this lightweight dryer with the on off switch on the back of the handle fits the bill perfectly   i will probably buy another one as a back up for when this one wears out   i highly recommend this dryer  and you can t beat the price  good  great service  i just wish that i had realized that the barrel is so long  my wife has a short arm  and has difficulty using the dryer  i like the warm and cool feature  diffuser attachment an added bonus replacement dryer for the original one i broke  love it  it works ok  easy to use  nothing special about it   it says for salon use but  it would take to long to dry salon hair  i had a salon use blow dryer and it dried my hair much faster but the price was around  200 to replace it   so  for the price of the mhd dryer it works just fine  it just takes longer  great dryer    the directions were not made for people who have no idea what they are doing  so it tooke about a month or so to actually put it together    but i got it and i love it  i would just say  put in better instructions to follow  excellent i bought this hair dryer because it s dual voltage and i needed something for a trip to italy   it worked wonderfully in europe   and it s working great at home too   nice and powerful  very happy with the unit  fantastic product   save time each morning with this amazing product i really like this hair dryer  although it s a bit heavy on my hands as i m using it  it leaves my hair looking shiny and smooth with minimal frizz  it also dries my hair efficiently and quickly  highly recommend it and it s at a great price   this sounds weird  but the   34 night light  34  is much too bright   i had to tape something over it to mute the light   the mounting bracket is tricky to install and kind of flimsy too i wish this one had the ionic feature that my other one has  which seems to dry my hair a lot faster  but still a great compact dryer that is a great addition to my bathroom  changed my drying time   great product great product got this for my mom  who wanted a dryer with a strong   34 blow   34  i have a remington that is great  but that model is no longer available   so i got her this one based on other positive reviews  and she really likes it  works just as well as a full sized hair dryer even though it is the size of a toy   processed hair benefits greatly from salon deep conditioning and this is a great home alternative  gets super hot if you need it  also allows home hair coloring that requires heat   love it  this is the best dryer   does not burn your hair  and dries it very quickly size and heat output is a great combo this was a gift for my wife   it has worked flawlessly for months now   great product  not as good as the one i had 10 years ago  the old one was a better quality and this make hair a little frizzy excellent  my teen age son was leaving his previous dryer laying on the sink   sometimes the cord would be in the sink   this freaked me out a bit so i ordered this wall unit   this was easy and quick to install   i love it   my son loves it  does not blow hard enough for me  bought a different brand and it works great  love  love  love this little hair dryer  i got it because it tucked into my smallish bathroom cabinet but was pleasantly surprised how well it worked  it has at least as much power as the full size dryer i am replacing  i haven t missed the old one for a minute  plus  as promised  this has a very compact size that makes storage and travel easy  very easy purchase  dryer works great  totally satisfied customer  received exactly when promised  product is exactly what i was looking for and met or exceeded expectations  this hairdryer is the best i have had     it is much better than even my  125 hairdryer  this is now my favorite hair dryer  i use it every day  it s so light my wrist doesn t get tired  this dryer does the job  but it s a little loud  and it doesn t seem to get as hot as my last dryer   it takes a little longer to dry my hair  but at the price i paid  it was still a good value   i ve had it for many months and it still works fine  i waited 6 mos to write this review because i wanted to be sure it atleast lasted that long  this thing is perfect for home use  i use it on myself and my daughter  roller sets come out perfect  twistouts dry in half the time wash and go s have less shrinkage because the gel cast sets faster  i m so glad i ordered this product  it is top heavy when you try and roll it i support the bottom and top as i push but it mainly stays in one spot  the bell can be a bit startling but mainly because you tune out the sound of the dryer so when the timer goes off you ve forgotten what you were doing  i dont find it necessary to crank the heat all the way up  at mid range my hair is dry in about 40min  in short    i love this dryer and if anything happened to it i would gladly purchase again  i ordered my dryer the week of christmas it was on my doorstep the next day works perfectly  excellent product being a guy i never saw a need for a hair dryer  but recently i found it gives me a ton of volume  duh   this is a great buy and the attachment works wonders during styling  not to mention  if you are a hairy guy  it makes the drying process of the rest of your body a lot easier  better than my old one  this gets the job done faster and a lot quieter  i read the reviews on this hair dryer and decided to give it a try  going on a big trip and definitely needed a small travel size dryer  this hairdryer is amazing for its size   i have fine hair but a lot of it and this thing works great great  it s amazing for its size how much power it has  i have a very expensive ionic ceramic dryer and this thing dries my hair just as well  i ve actually even started using it on an every day basis and for the price you cannot go wrong  great product and amazing price    everyone that comes over comments    here did you get a hotel hair dryer  i want one     it works great  i use it every single morning and also with some craft projects  it   easy to use and i love love love how you just shove it in it   holster  like slamming an old telephone haha  very satisfying because it turns off when you put it in its home  love that about it  i also like the position of the grip  br   i mounted mine onto tile with two 3m heavy duty adhesive strips so we didn   have to drill holes  it   holding up well and when it is time to take it off  you just slide the base off it   mount and work with it directly  great buy works great  my wife really liked it for mother s day  its dries her hair faster than her old one  light too bright this hair dryer is light  quiet  and best of all  the cord swoops right up into the body of the dryer with the push of a button  i love  love  love this feature  love it     i ve had it for couple of months now  definitely recommend it  great very good hair dryer  mounting bracket works very good  worked great until it broke 8 5 months in  i shopped around for a blow dryer and was about to buy one for well over 100 dollars when i came across this one    so i thought i would give it a chance   i am happy to say that i love it   the chord is nice and long  the buttons are easy to set and do not sit in an area where they are in the way   the cold shot button must be held down but it shoots out a nice cold blast of air to help set your hair   the hot setting is super hot but i am sure works well with thick hair   i mostly use the medium heat without any damage  i hairdresser recommended this blow dryer to me she said it was the strongest and best she has ever used  she was right   i m pretty sure they use this blow dryer in the movie twister to make the tornadoes  super product  great hair dryer  it s the perfect size and drys your hair quickly  love everything about it i love this hair dryer   i have had 3   every time one stops working  i buy another one   it makes my hair look and feel great  just the right size and power for travel  its fine perfect  good power  heats great  love the ergonimical style i love this hair dryer works great love this hairdryer   i keep getting compliments on my hair lately and the only thing i ve done differently is to start using this blow dryer  with no cut or professional styling in months   the small diffuser was a tight fit at first  but the more i ve used it  the easier it s gotten  i guess the little tabs had to be rubbed down a bit  never had a problem with the curling diffuser  2 months in and am satisfied so far  good product works fine but at their higher price no longer a good buy this hairdryer does not get very hot  on high heat it blows warm cool on the low blow setting  even on the high heat and high blow setting it is only warm   it takes longer to dry my hair with this than my 10 year old panteen hair dryer  no reduction in frizz  i bought this on amazon but i saw this exact hairdryer at dollar general for  15   it is ok  i wouldn t buy it again  fit my old wall mount   works great  this product did not work at all  it seems to be newand fine but never went on love  love  love it  very strong wind and make my hair dry much faster  can t live without it  love it the best hair dryer   in fact this was a replacement for the one i had for ten years works great gave me my independence back  love this love it   does not frizz out my hair at all in fact it smooths it really well and gives me that just went to the salon look  this is my second andis wall mounted hair dryer  which replaced one that was over 5 years old   of course  the wall mount feature is the best for keeping a clutter free countertop  but i also appreciate that it is quiet and has the power to dry my hair quickly    i have thick  shoulder length hair   very good product  good hair dryer  great for speed drying and traveling  love it  makes me hair smooth and dries my hair quickly  love it  quietiest hair dryer that we ve ever owned   very powerful  drys quickly and efficiently   love this hair dryer  nice product  but never got the diffuser it was supposed to come with  i absolutely love this dryer  the buttons are easy to use  the concentrator nozzle keeps my hair smooth and it dries in half the time  i would buy this again  wife didn t really like it  wasn t impressed  works fine though  overheats really easy    it is light  small  cute and works ok apart from that    i would also prefer the tip   34 thinner  34  great product quiet like i ve never experienced i forget it s on if i walk away from it  lol br   gets really hot so be careful to adjust or sit low   best dryer ever and i ve owned 7 i   better impressed with the curlipops diffuser dryer than i was with my deceased conair curl fusion ionic ceramic styler hair dryer  next to current generation  which the curlipops is replacing for me  both dryers have negative ionic technology  which makes them preferable to the free hairdryers at hotels  the gym  and my therapy pool  as i always notice much more frizz when i use those dryers than when i use my own  so  in that regard  they  e both preferable imo  br    br   unlike the conair  the curlipops allows you to position the diffuser the way you want to  and for me that   so that there aren   large gaps between the dryer fan and your hair  it may be that i have a heightened sense of safety awareness  after working in health care for 38 years  but the conair   clipping on in a way that kept the gaps as wide as possible didn   give me a whole lot of confidence that it would work well for   ixiecurling   for those who don   know  this is a method of drying curly hair  developed by someone who goes by   ixiecurl  on naturallycurly com  in which you scrunch your hair into the bowl of a dryer   diffuser with the dryer off  turn it on and dry that section of hair  then turn it off before repositioning the dryer  because the dryer isn   on when you do the scrunching  curls stay better defined  but another factor is that your hair isn   being pushed away by airflow when you  e positioning the dryer  only possibly an issue with a pancake style dryer  i was still too chicken to try it with pixiecurling  but used the method jessica mcguinty  of jessicurl  uses in her hair drying video   60 https   www youtube com watch v cyyoypbthi0  62   and it worked great  my hair dried a lot faster  curled really well  and i had no problems with frizz as it finished drying  although it   a little difficult to attach initially  the diffuser works really well  and that   no biggie since i have no reason to keep removing and reattaching it  it just resides on the dryer  so one for curlipops  br    br   it has three heat settings  cool  warm  and hot  which are independent of the airflow speed  as well as having a cool shot button  i don   use high speed because it disorganizes my curls  i   also unlikely to use hot  but it   nice to have the option of finishing with cool air without having to hold the cool shot button down for an extended period of time  the conair has hi  off  and lo  along with a cool shot button  so airspeed and heat  or lack thereof  are connected to each other  and i score another one for the curlipops  br    br   whine  the conair has it in spades  and the curlipops has very little  so i give this one to the curlipops too  br    br   both dryers are listed as having the same weight  according to amazon  though that   really the shipping weight  it   a little more than i   like  considering i have fibromyalgia  and i don   need any help making my arms and shoulders ache  but it   still better than getting hypothermia  pneumonia  or bronchitis  also  not having the dryer permanently attached to a wall means i can get into more comfortable positions while drying my hair  both still weigh less than my mother   non ionic  folding  travel dryer  which i used once while i was moving her  then abandoned due to the abundant halo of frizz it created  so score one for both pancake dryers  however  neither one has dual voltage  and the curlipops   instructions specifically state it should not be used with a voltage converter  so it would not be a possible choice for travel outside of north america curlipops  br    br   it has three heat settings  cool  warm  and hot  which are independent of the airflow speed  as well as having a cool shot button  i don   use high speed because it disorganizes

nice blower  this dryer is amazing  it works better than the shop dryers  it s super quiet besides the timer tick but even the tick is less noisy than the shop dryer  me and my clients can carry on a conversation and they can enjoy watching t v  this dryer exceeded my expectations in all areas and it was also very easy to assemble  the shipping was also awesome it arrived within 3 days from ordering it  i recommend this dryer to anyone  i have thick hair and this baby gets my hair dry quickly and without frizzies  love it  this dryer is so light weight   i was amazing by that  it is perfect for what i needed  does what it is supposed to  a noted design flaw    the hose connector to the bonnet does not couple well  or rather stay connected  i suggest that you shove the male hose part into the female bonnet part  without using the notches  it may permanently attach the tow so you can no longer use the brush or detach them  but it will keep the two secure   also it kind of smells weird when on  bought dryer for my daughter it isn t hot enough for me but awesome for my 10yr old to dry her thin fine hair with i have very thick and coarse hair and this is the best hairdryer i have owned until now  it gets my hair dry so fast  and the end results are smooth and frizzless hair  with other hair dryers it takes anywhere from 25 35 minutes but this one literally takes 7 10 minutes plus adds more volume to my hair the heat settings are perfect as well in case someone doesn t want to add too much heat to your hair    every dryer i have ever owned did pretty much all the same things but at the end made my hair frizzy and dried my hair out  this dryer is the only one that makes my hair look so beautiful  sleek  soft and shiny  it makes my hair so smooth that i almost don t have to flat iron it since it is naturally wavy  freakinglyyy amazing   good merchandise for the price  a   great power  compact shape  easy to use  this is for my regular daily use because the small size fits under my sink but is powerful enough to blow out my hairstyle every day  i got this as a gift to my mom and she love it      super tiny but works great  perfect for weekend trips away from home and small enough to toss in a bag and take to the gym  not terribly noisy either  i wish it had a medium heat setting but other than that  i can t complain  i love it  no more clutter in the bathroom  i like tha it has the hot and warm heat adjustment   works great  of the two blow dryers that i own  this attachment fits neither  great hairdryer  my favorite hair dryer  powerful  totally recommended  a lot of power   heavier than some hair dryers that i have previously owned   doesn t get as hot as i would like it to  but still styles your hair effectively  good value i am very happy  so this blow dryer has a purple hint of color just an fyi and love it  i used it for the first time because my other blow dryer would cause a lot of split ends  instantly  so i used it for the first time and no split ends  yay   i also did use another blow out product with this blow dryer which you should try to prevent split ends  i use the redken satinwear blow dry lotion before i start blow drying and both combined work wonders  your hair will look like you just came out of the salon  this is actually a pretty darned good blow dryer for the price   just wish the cord was longer  good product work well and has great heat  i can dry my hair very fast love the hot pink   different speeds and heat settings are fantastic   re tractable cord works well  the best hair dryer ever  my children are biracial so i have to find products that can accompany their individual hair textures  my daughter has coarse thick hair whereas my son has thin straight hair  this dryer works for both of them efficiently  works fast  don t need a flat iron for my daughter since this gets it pretty straight while drying  cuts time in half  bought based on good reviews and i now highly recommend it myself   try it and you ll never want a different hair dryer  i love the amount of air it produces and the multiple heat and blow settings  bigger than i expected   doesn t fit in my drawer   but the product itself works great  very good for the price  gets super hot so you have to be careful  love this hair dryer  it dries my hair faster than others and makes my hair soft  exactly what i was looking for  here s hoping it lives a long and service oriented life  best hair dryer i have ever owned  absolute bargain of the century  my wife had two chi s break in the course of around five years  while most would argue that 2 3 years is adequate   when one pays  100  for a hairdryer  you expect to see many long years of service  instead of sinking another hundo into what is just a high priced chinese made hair dryer  we took a gamble on the herstyler pro  the result  my wife is 101  pleased   really  fit and finish is as good as the chi  logical button placement and function is perfect  temps are ideal  force is great and the whole hairdryer feels like a salon professional  they could double the price and it would still be a steal  very well done  i like it so much  we are buying a second to stick on the shelf if the first ever gives up the ghost  good love it  not to hot  drys my hair quickly and my hair looks fab  what more could i ask for  i m glad i did not get one of the more pricey dryers  works very well and fast  i have medium long wavy hair  it looks very healthy after blow drying without even any product  i am saving a lot by not having to use products in my hair anymore  very good quality product for good price perfect i have had a couple of these over the years   they ve been great   lasted a long time   easy to mount   great night light too  great dryer  easy to hold  made really well  drys hair in no time at all amazing value  very nice hairdryer  wishing the size is smaller though  great little travel dryer   super strong for the size  i use this to style my epic beard  it is great  the only down side i can thik of is the attachment only fits this hair dryer  this is a great hair dryer at a great price  purchased several of these a few years ago  gave one as a gift and my wife kept one  she loved hers  so when she recently gave it to our daughter she bought this one as a replacement  my wife likes the size  power and temperature of this hair dryer and rates it 5 stars  best hair dryer i ve used  light weight and dries hair fast  love it  lots of power and drys my hair quickly used this dryer during a recent trip to europe   so easy to use in different countries and compact to carry  couldn t ask for a better  more efficient dryer   i even used it to warm cold food in my hotel room  but don t tell anybody  works beautifully and fast   lots of heat choices   hot is hot with this dryer   i had to wear a terry headband around my forehead  ears  neck because of the   34 leakage  34  of hot air  but otherwise  it dried my curly hair very quickly  almost as fast as at the salon   love the thin case and the way the power cord  bonnet and air hose store in the case   i worried about where i d store this in a small apartment  but it s no problem  great deal  love it except it is a little heavy  works great and keeps my daughter from borrowing my wife s all the time  good product  received quickly  as expected  my wife really liked this product it s good great product  fast delivery and reasonable price  highly recommended  i ve had this blow dryer for about six months  it dries  it s strong  but i keep smelling a slight burn scent and i feel like it s just about ready to bite the dust  i don t really even blow dry my hair that often  also  it claims to be   34 ionic  34  but my hair is totally frizzy after using it  so it seems like just a buzz word on this product  you get what you pay for  i ll be shopping for a more quality product  this is our second wall mounted hair dryer and i can see some improvements in the design   we are very happy with its performance  i know everyone has said this dryer is awesome blah blah blah  i normally love andis products  but this has ended their winning streak with me  i purchased this for deep conditions and to style my hair roller sets  twists etc  this bonnet is so small it only fit on my 7yr olds head and that was a tight fit  i really tried to make it work but after i knocked all my pink rollers loose  everyone got a hearty laugh i gave up   don t know if they used small models for the design or maybe i need a plus size head bonnet either way it was a return for me  super powerful and versatile  why does this little compact travel dryer work better than my bigger more expensive hair dryer  which i ve put away in the guest bathroom  this is a great little dryer  i wish it had a quick cool shot button  but i wouldn t avoid buying it for that reason  works really well  i ve only used this for a couple of weeks  but so far has met my expectations   just installed a new handicapped shower  mounted this just outside the shower above a gfi receptacle   it does a great job both drying me off  and drying the many shelves in the shower which hold water  my soap now stays dry and firm  and my bath mat doesn t get waterlogged  br   best feature   the magnet which holds the dryer in the cradle  most plastic latches fail after a few months  but the magnet should be bulletproof  i also like the long cord which reaches to the end of my 5 foot shower  if one doesn t have a   34 backer board  34  i recommend   34 molly  34  anchors to mount the dryer metal bracket  awesome product but did not give 5 stars because it didn t last long before it started giving problems  for the money paid  expected the product to hold up longer  good this blow dryer is very powerful and does the job  love this hair dryer   this works well very gentle and it makes my hair smooth bought it for a few months and works well  very good and i love it  not as hot as the dryer it replaced  but i adapted   the retractable cord is a wonderful feature  so far it is working lovely  it dries my hair very fast though it does not have the changing voltz feature i like it  is a little heavy but you can see it is of good quality  hope electric accident won t happen  great dryer  doesn t seem to be hot enough  but i like the power  it is the right size  not to big for the bathroom and with a lot of power the brush is much to soft   doesn t really serve a purpose  works great   just a little heavy  good for rv s i love the number of options this dryer gives you as far as heat and intensity  the attachment is smooth and the dryer is quiet  good purchase  this is the best blow dryer  very powerful and the low heat setting is definitely low heat    most blow dryers low setting seems to be more hot than low  multiple settings  light  and easy to use my hair has never been better    it s a good  hair dryer for the price  it s light weight and you still get the benefits fr om a full side hair dryer  the lettering on the handle did rub off within  a week but that s not a big deal for me  overall i m pretty happy with my purchase  very disappointed  i have bought this exact product about 5 6 times over the last 8 years  it was awesome  great heat great weight attractive etc  but the last 2 i ordered from amazon the plug in design changed and it fits to loosely into the wall socket  and sparks  which is scary  i love the hair dyer itself  but the new design of the plug in is faulty  what can be done      my old dryer was not putting out any heat  that was why i bought this one  it does not put out as much air as my old one  but it does a good job of drying my hair  had the blow dryer for several months now    no problem does not over heat     best investment love this dryer  professional results without the price  great better than expected  really great value to price ratio  did not find any of the issues regarding control buttons  love the settings  cool setting a big   and a cold button for a burst of chilly air  2 speeds  3 setting plus cold button  fantastic air flow  does what it says for a fraction of the price of high end salon brands  would gladly buy again  when wife is happy with purchase  husband is happy with purchase works so good i bought another one when my wife decided to take the first one with her to her exercise class each morning  i simply cannot say enough wonderful things about this product   my reasons for a 5 star rating  br    br   positives  br     powerful and efficient   hair dries quickly without being blown wild br     able to easily style while drying br     comes with two attachments and they stay in place wonderfully br     retractable cord eliminates hassles between uses br     for a hair drying styler  this is not excessively loud br    br   negatives  br     no complaints  br    br   this has been my top choice in hair dryers after using my sister s awhile ago   i finally confirmed the type to purchase   then  i found it on amazon s   34 today s deals  34   daily deals    even better   this is a fabulous hair drying styler at an extremely reasonable price  as listed or with a deal    over my lifetime  i have used many hair dryers  with a wide price range  and had not ever been super pleased with any one in particular    before using this one   i was so looking forward to getting it and was super excited to use it    i was not disappointed at all  replaced a earlier version  works well  wife happy hair dryer is perfect and haven t had any problems since purchase  my wife really loves this dryer  it was easy to put together and works great  it dries her long hair just the way she likes it  she s happy   i m happy  love the night light and works great   i rate the product 4 stars  it dries quickly and cuts down the frizz a bit  but nothing out of this world  however  i just interacted with customer service for a problem  and i was very impressed with how the company handled the situation  the product definitely deserves an extra star for customer service  very good for travel and very potent  great dryer love it best blow dryer i have ever purchased  great value this hair dryer is amazing  br    br   only flaw  there s no swivel cord  making it resist moving around  br    br   otherwise  its great  the perfect size for my weekend bag and there are plenty of settings  this is an okay product  if you avidly blow dry your hair get a bigger one  but for the occasional use it s okay this is perfect  works great and so easy travel with due to is compact size  before i ever used this product i thought all hair dryers are the same because they simply just blow air  after used my friend s panasonic nano hair dryer  i knew i was wrong  this is so much better than the cheap dryer i bought at supermarket  my hair wasn t at all frizzy with this new hair dryer  i m in love with this product i love this dryer and wish they made it in a smaller travel size  only drawback is that the attachment bends easily so if you pack it make sure to take it off first  it heats up better than any other dryer i ve used and my salon uses these exclusively  the only reason i cannot give it 5 stars is because it will not stick to my vanity which is made out of wood  it won   hold in place after i place the blow dryer  does stick very well to my vanity in the bathroom  glass marble   great hair dryer   doesn t cause too much frizz   love the retractable cord  great for drying hair  i m not completely impressed with the cheap plastic although  ive used it about 6 times and it s still in good condition   also keep in mind that i am hispanic and have very long  thick and curly hair    i purchased this because my daughter has one and after using it  i fell in love  but  hers is definitely made with better quality materials  you can tell by just holding both of them in your hands the difference in quality   i thought i was getting a super steal based on the price i paid for it   25  opposed to what my daughter paid   she purchased hers directly from andis for  52  as i previously mentioned  mines is still in good condition after using it several times  i m just waiting to see how many more uses i get out of it  this is a case of you get what you pay for  very fprceful and dries my hair in 5 minutes just like the professionals do it  i bought this two days ago as my old dryer  conair 1875 watt  hasn t been drying as well lately   i was impressed immediately with this dryer   it is beautiful   it is slightly heavier than my last one   but it cut drying time considerably so i don t think this will be an issue   it has three speeds   it has three temperature settings  the highest is hotter than any blow dryer i have ever used   i just dried my hair with it and my naturally wavy hair is so straight that i don t need to break out my flat iron  yes  i am amazed by this thing  the medium heat setting is equivalent to my last dryers hottest setting   i have twin daughters that are young and i think the only setting cool enough to dry their hair with is the lowest heat setting  this dryer is so powerful   yet a ton quieter than my previous dryer  my husband even commented on how quiet it is  my husband also liked the fact that it is heavier   being a mechanic he said it probably has a stronger   more durable motor  i was reading the booklet that was included  and this dryer has a four year warranty   that s pretty astounding considering the price point   i love this dryer   and i d buy it again in a heart beat   i m thinking about buying another one to store   because i seriously love it that much   go buy it  the description for this product is incorrect   it does not contain a cool shot button  used once on vacation so i can not comment on the longevity of this product  size is slightly bigger than i had hoped  but i bought it because it was the best looking diffuser to come w  a travel dryer that i could find   price was right and i think it was a good investment for a travel dryer only  i would not use this for regular at home use  the wife is very happy with this   it was a replacement of a similar conair that lasted many years   this one has held up for a few months now and looks like it will hold up like the old one   i am pretty sure she will buy a similar conair if when this one breaks  love it  burned up first time used this is an excellent product  i love it  works very well   i have the same blow dryer in the past and that lasted a long time it s a really great blow dryer i have straight thick hair and my old hair dryers would leave it frizzy until i slept on it  however when i tried it with this blowdryer  even at the fast dry attachment  it was smooth and sleek  br    br   now that i have a digital perm  i can use the diffuser  i put half of my hair twisted  sectioned into thirds and put it on the diffuser  it works wonderful so far  i m so happy with this blow dryer  worth the price  first expensive blow dryer i have owned  now i can have nice waves  makes my hair drying time much shorter  edit  br   turned my hair into straw br    br   original review  br    br   pros  good blow  not too hot br   cons heavy and the way the attachments attach is bad  you really have to push super hard  br    br   best under  100 hairdryer i have ever used  i had a 20  of coupon at that big bed and bath store  it was 99 99 so i got a good deal  it is a solid hair dryer and solid made  made in italy  good blow and not too hot means hair dries faster with less damage  with good technique can leave hair silky soft  not as defrizzing as my volare though  and it feels heavier to me  so my volare will remain my baby  it is better than the elchim 2001  the  300 t3    200 chi and an fhi dryer that i tried  i have super long wavy hair  live in the bay area  and i don t get haircuts often enough  so i need the anti frizz  also i am not great at blowdrying hair so i need the idiot proof anti frizzer  br    br   it is not as good as my volare v2 by babyliss with the ferrari ac motor  paid  70 more for   that dryer is magic  that and the italiabrava by babyliss are the best hairdryers on the market  i have a conair hair dryer that i use at home   i bought this one for a trip to the uk because of the dual voltage feature and compact size   my trip is in three weeks so i am yet to try it out overseas yet but it arrived quickly and does seem very lightweight and easy to pack  favorite model  no longer available in stores  bought as backup for 3 year old one currently using  works great   multiple speed and temps  powerful  and quiet  it doesn t have that high pitched whine  it doesn t get super hot and doesn t have to because it s powerful enough  other dryers would make my hair hot to the touch or burn my hand  my hair seems to be healthier and smoother after using this for a couple months too  the best i love the product the best travel dryer i have found  so much power in this little thing  thought it would be more compact  for traveling  just a little big but okay very good easy installation would recommend to anyone to try it saw this in hotel and loved it great power and gets the job done fast  love this item  the heat is perfect for my hair and did i mention tht delivery was great  came right on time    my wife and kids love it  and for that  i m a happy customer  perfect seems to work  don t use it much  great dryer  dries fast    the hottest setting is really hot so be careful not to burn yourself  this little hair dryer is great  i had one just like it in the past  it lasted 20 years  it fits perfectly in my suit case  has just the right amount of power and heat  it is much better than others i have used  they did not last long   it is well constructed too  a good purchase  i had looked every where for a replacement and had to settle for inferior products  i am really happy amazon had it  i highly recommend  i have had better conair products in the past  love love this hair dryer  my first time to own a turbo power but should have been buying for years  live and learn  br   i have very fine  thin  hair and all my other dryers have been to harsh on my fragile locks with 1875 watts  after researching the best for my hair issues   the lower wattage  1500   is perfect and dries my hair beautifully  smooth and shinny  this dryer is also very substantial in motor which is important to me so it will last  very lightweight so i don t end up with cramped arms after using these  the buttons are also placed away from my fingers so i don t accidentally turn them off  bargain price for a great hairdryer   several heat and speed settings  dries your hair quickly  haven t used the diffuser yet but it is looks good  only had my dryer for a month but so far it s the best one i ve ever had   ionic  feature makes hair smooth   seems to be built sturdy   folding handle retractable cord work well   it it holds up it s a super buy at the price   not as heavy as i expected   works well and the power is good  awesome product  tucked out of the way in the female s bathroom of my home  i also purchased one for the male s bathroom in the house and will put in the master bathroom once i am complete with the remodel so if i ever get married again she will have one to use  great night light also  never have to turn on the bathroom light in the middle of the night   it is the best hair dryer i have  i used have a old one which i used for many years  best quality  fairly quiet as hair dryers go  like the attachments  love the brown and pink color  excellent product   this is one of the best hair dryer i have ever own   highly recommended     decided to buy this hairdryer based on all the positive reviews   i am very pleased with my purchase  the reviews are accurate and the price is great too  fantastic hair dryer  was searching for a new hair dryer as my hot tools dryer was giving off a burning smell and really drying out my hair  i decided on xtava because of the good reviews and so glad i purchased it   the nozzle for the dryer stays firmly in place which is fantastic since when i tried to use one on my previous dryers  it would always fall off   my hair comes out super smooth   it is very powerful and not super noisy  another great feature is the removable back to clean out lint  i was also really impressed with the welcome letter from the company i received via email after i received the dryers with tips on blow drying my hair  would definitely recommend this dryer to anyone i know  love it  this is my 2nd purchase of this product i wore the first one out after 11 years   it still worked but the black cover blocking the heat would no longer stay on  i love this hair dryer it leaves my hair so soft no frizz   well worth the money   one of those cases you get what you pay for  very pleased with the dryer   it s a little heavier than my last one  but does a great job  i would recommend  i would highly recommend this blow dryer  even my mother in law said it is awesome  it is powerful and dries my hair fast  i plan to look at other products made by them as well  sweet  works as expected  i love it  it fits my little peanut head just fine and really snug  i used it to deep condition my hair with a plastic cap and silk bonnet on top then the hair dryer bonnet  i used the silk bonnet to protect my ears and neck from getting to hot  this is the first time i have ordered this and i m very happy  highly satisfied with the hair dryer and the company  my hair is long and thick  it is every texture in the book  some curly hair  some straight  some frizzy  some fine  a lot gray  all highlighted colored  it normally takes me 20   30 minutes to get it completely dry  then i need to use the flat iron to calm it all down  with this hair dryer i had it completely dry in 10 minutes  when i use it with the goody quikstyle brush my hair is smooth enough that i only have to touch up a couple places with the flat iron  i live in the deep south  heat and humidity are a way of life  i can t tell you how happy i am with a hair dryer that cuts 10   20 minutes off the time i have to spend blowing more hot air my way  br   also  i have received two very service minded emails from the company  it is because of these that i was prompted to write a review   a quality product and a customer service driven company deserve a shout out  we liked this so much we bought them for the rest of the bathrooms  convenient and easy to install  it even has a tiny night light built into it  great ceramic blow dryer  arrived promptly  entirely satisfied  love this dryer  ordered with amazon prime under 12   2 day arrival and use just for my wonder wash and vapper dry system  wash in wonder wash  wring  hang on dryers until near dry and hang inside vapper last few minutes for warm towels  shirts  light robes  socks etc good laundry system under 90  no more laundry mats   the wall mount dryer was just what i needed for my new small bathroom as i do not have any counter space   works great  update       3rd time using it on travel   love this little dryer     fits great in my hand  easy control     3 4 finished with a blow dry   hair soft waves and then          oh no      it died   not circuit tripped  i pushed the reset  i plugged into other outlets      i was in denial   i just shook it and then  headed out to walmart with my 3 4 blown out hair  with the one section not done in a french braid       lol      alas  back to a big dryer   i really liked this but only got to use it 3 times  br         br   purchased for travel because of it s small size  also purchased to use with soft hood dryer attachment   wow this little dryer is quite powerful   the switch was a little stiff to turn on at first and if feels a little cheap but torumaliine ceramic  little power house   love it  broke my arm and went on vacation so this little gadget hellped a lot  it will not hold a heavy dryer  but worked fine with a travel dryer suction will not work on a porous surface but did fine on a mirror or glass shower door  best hairdryer i have ever used   large impellers really put out some air which speeds drying   can be very powerful or not depending on the setting you choose  excellent i love it perfect hairdryer  wonderful  just what i was looking for  i have medium length  thick  wavy hair  it smooths as it dries  is light weight and quiet  and i love how hot it gets  lets me know its really working  excellent my hair normally takes forever to dry  but not with this dryer  it  drys so quickly and will not dry out your hair  worth every penny it works ok but it s not the easiest drier to use  it has an odor to it and i wish it was just a little smaller in size very good this is a very nice dryer  suits my needs very well  quiet and compact  the dryer seems to be of good quality and would be easy to use if the nozzle were shorter   i like the hairdryer itself very much but the nozzle is so long that i can t style the back of my hair easily   i have shorter arms but i have never had this problem with other hair dryers   do you have a shorter nozzle to fit this dryer   i bought this dryer because my old one was wearing out and a piece of the nozzle came off   making it difficult to use  i tend to have frizzy hair   i honestly haven t noticed a difference between this hair dryer or any old regular hair dryer making my hair less frizzy   i ordered this one because my old one broke   i m not noticing any difference  this dryer works well for a time  but breaks easily  i ve replaced it 3 times  three  i bought it because it was the cheapest option  but after purchasing it 3 times  i should ve just gone with a higher end model  perfect size for traveling abroad and the price was right  i wish it was a tad more powerful but i can live with it   34 as is  34   this is a very good dryer i give it 5 stars  br   thanks very small and very light   perfect for travel and my silicon diffuser fits right over the nozzles   i recommend this product  fit right where we needed it in our motorhome heavy duty awesome dryer  the cord alone lends itself to the words   34 heavy duty  34   powerful  light weight  multi heating options  the best dryer i ve ever purchased in my 50  years  that is when hand held dryers began  i have long hair and it s cut my time in half  i can t say more other than i hope it last me a long time  thought it would be more powerful  is it really 2000 watts  extremely fast delivery and the product works great  very happy  it s great i enjoy working it  thanks much    as expected  good dries my hair incredibly quickly  what used to take 20 minutes now takes 5  it makes getting ready in the morning much more pleasant  i recently became aware of xtava products while looking for a new hairdryer  i wanted the ceramic ionic technology as i have baby fine hair which tends to break and attract static way too easily  this hair dryer has been amazing  it s super quiet and has multiple heat levels which is great  i can usually dry my hair in about 4 to 5 minutes  i use the dryer with a flat brush  and have noticed my hair is smooth  shiny  and frizz free  br    br   i also have to say that xtava has excellent customer service  when i originally purchased the dryer  amazon fulfilled the order and shipped the wrong one  xtava was super helpful in getting the issue resolved with amazon  i now own two xtava dryers and love them both  i m really happy with my purchases  and the quality of the xtava products  i highly recommend this dryer  i have had three of these over the years  ionizing dryer keeps the frizz out of your hair  cool setting is nice in addition to the two settings for hot  blasting and normal  great hair dryer  the hair dryer has performed very  very well  i hadn t realized how much time the old dryer was taking to dry and style my hair  br   claire greenberg great power blow dryer for wonderful price  love it dry so fast   not very good with freez but for the price is good  great love the small size and the way that it dries my hair   great little hair dryer  this is the 4th time i ve bought this dryer over the course of a several years  it does fail at some point  but at the constant daily use it gets  still very worth the price  it s quite powerful and puts out more heat and airflow than others i ve used  very happy with it overall  excellent noise levels  very low  heat control very good as well  great hairdryer so far  particularly vs  previous conair models  the retractable cord is wonderful for storage   power is great  i purchased this hair dryer a couple of months ago after my old conair died   i like to use my dryers on low speed  but high heat   although the two settings should be independent  this dryer is just lukewarm on low speed   it also made my hair fuzzy  and while it was lightweight   it felt cheap  br    br   i quit using it two months after i started using it and invested in a better dryer   i purchased the elchim 2001 through amazon  and while it s a bit more expensive   80   it s worth every penny   i would not recommend the conair 1875  unless you want your hair to look like a fuzzy mess  great performance but they need work on the product painting  the paint started pilling after a few day s using the dryer but in general it s a great product for the price great product for price the dryer work fine for about 10 months but it did end up catching fire while i was using it  i think for the price it should last longer than 10  months  great little dryer the motor died after a year of very light use   2 3x month   it was a very poor value for the  80 i paid in sept 2013  br    br   i wasn t very impressed even while it was functioning    34 blowout  34  styling results were not as good as i get with my drugstore cheapie  hairs would get chomped and tangled in the dryer  poor button placement so the controls were frequently switched on off  high low by the palm of my hand while i was trying to dry my hair   maybe i gripped it funny  but it did annoy me every time i used it  makes my hair smooth wow this dryer came in and i was so happy with the design and color of it it also came in the nick of time as my much cheaper hair dryer had just went out believe me when i say this hair dryer is top of the line  straight out of the box i noticed that it was light weight and had a sleek design upon use of this product i seen that it had several different settings as to get the desired drying time you d like it includes a diffuser to keep your hair from getting too overheated and dried out plus it has a reset and test button on the plug in when i used this hair dryer i noticed that at the highest heat that the air is not super strong like some other hair dryers out there but it definitely dries your hair in record time  this hair dryer is easy to hold on to whilst drying your hair and has a good vent on the back as to not clog up easily i recommend this hair dryer to anyone looking for a new replacement because it work really well and is high quality for your money  br   i got this product for purpose of review all claims and views are 100 percent my own  i am so excited by this dryer  it much quieter than my old one and dries my hair super fast without feeling dried out  not disappointed  works well and super small  perfect for travel  ok hair dryer   i like the non skid rubber thingies on the sides of the dryer so it doesn t slip off bathroom shelf   the overall drying could be improved   my vidal sassoon travel dryer of the same wattage dried my hair much faster   i m going to buy another one of those again and just keep this one as a backup dryer in our guest bath  had one of these in dark blue for years  it finally gave out  this one is alright  but feels lighted and cheaper made then my old one  love the retractable cord  dryer is extremely heavy   not as hot or strong as other comparably priced dryers   buttons are easy to accidentally press while drying   returned it after trying it once  best blowdryer for natural girls  i never use anything else very fast drying experience  i absolutely love that it offers the two heat settings and separate speeds  my old dryer only had one control and if you wanted high speed it meant you had to have hair frying temperatures along with it  with the wind flower dryer i m able to have a cooler temperature and impressively fast blowing capabilities  br    br   i have thick hard to dry hair and i can honestly say that i dried my hair faster than i ever have with other dryers  br    br   it s light weight so my arm didn t get tired using it which is also great  br    br   i received this with a promotional discount however my reviews are honest and unbiased  pleased with packaging and shipping  pleased with product  its better than our other brands and love how fast it dries my hair and leaves it less frizzy  this hair dryer performs as expected   i have dry damaged hair due to chemo 2 years ago   i have never owned a hair dryer and thought that maybe blow drying my hair with a diffuser to increase wave curl would make it look better but it didn t   however this is not due to the hair dryer   the hair dryer is light  was very easy to operate and try different hair styles with especially since it includes both a diffuser and a concentrator  i tried at least 10 different hair styles with this thing and found it super easy to adjust and operate   feature i love the most  adjustable heat setting   i use the warm instead of hot and i can put the fan on low or high depending on how fast i want it   great dryer for the price but also for all of the features  noisy  i don t see anything professional about this dryer  this is one powerful hair dryer  the heat can be controlled along with the height and hood position  great this isthe best  dryer i have ever used love this dryer the best that i have found so far  pro   lightweight  good power  less frizzies br   con   have to unplug nightlight in bathroom to accommodate the large gfc plug of dryer works great   dries my hair quickly and stores beautifully with the retractable cord and folding handle    so glad i got it     good this is a great hair dryer at a great price   my wife already had this one and has been using it for several years   so when my other brand hair dryer died  i bought this one and so far so good   i have been using it for about 3 months now  works great the picture of the product is deceptive  i bought it on amazon and what i received was a very cheap looking product  the instructions on how to hang it on the wall is also very confusing  i am concerned about the safety of this product so i have stopped using it  now i am left with a cheap dryer that i am never going to use  i wish i can return it back without paying a ton on shipping  this is a great hair dryer   it seems to be designed well  it s definitely pretty   doesn t take up too much space  it has all the features that i need  like multiple heat settings  multiple air flow settings and even a cool blast to set the style  it fits standard hair dryer attachments too    like a diffuser  it also comes with the attachment that focuses the air blast   i think it s called the nozzle  but it s key to minimizing damage on your hair  br    br   my last hair dryer  from a different brand  was closer to  65 and although it worked great  it started to breakdown within a couple of months  it finally cracked it half in my checked bag during a recent flight  the price was right for this dryer   and i love the customer centric focus of the company  xtava  br    br   i also love the follow up communication i received after buying this   tips for how to use it well  contact info if i have any problems  so  i m happy with the dryer  but communication from xtava has been really great   the next time i m in the market to buy something like this  i ll check xtava first  i love my andis ceramic blow dryer  not only does it get our hair dry quickly but it also straightens at the sam s time  can t get no better for me and my family  quick and easy  the best hair dryer i ever used   very light weight  easy to use with one hand as you round brush with the other    and overall was above my expectations  love this hairdryer  so fast and light  cut styling time in half wonderful hair dryer and at a good price great hair dryer works great  for the price  this hair buyer is wonderful  my hair is seriously prone to being frizzy  and with  1  being tourmaline ceramic   2  having a warm setting as well as a cool and hot  and  3  having a concentrator  my hair has started acting much better  it s also fairly quiet  the lack of five stars is because it isn t particularly easy to store  it barely fits in the normal size drawer  and including the diffuser  concentrator  and a hairbrush  it can be challenging to fit it in the drawer  definitely a wonderful buy  though  excellent i used amazon prime and got this pretty fast  i haven t used it as yet but i did test the item and it works seemingly well    the barrel of the blowdryer works pretty well and the force of the air blown was great  however while inspecting this item it has scuff marks on the   34 concentrator  34  as if it had been used before or before being shipped  not sure if it will lessen in terms of the force of the air over a period of time but we ll see  also at the back of the dryer there was a removable backing that allows for cleaning if the air vent gets clog  which i didn t expect and it was a pleasant supprise  the   34 concentrator  34  also takes quite a bit of strength to put on   twisting it on doesn t make much sense so i d recommend lining it up and the pushing it down on the barrel    my intial review however is 4stars  i will be doing an update within the next month   i m profesional hairstylist and i love it  i bought this hair dryer several years ago and really loved it  so when it stopped working recently due to a loose connection in the gfci plug i knew i had to purchase it again   the retractable cord is just brilliant    every hair dryer should have this feature   the cool shot button is handy to help set your style   and the diffuser attachment is just  fabulous   with air being directed in and through the prongs as well as around them to provide more even heat and air distribution   i am so glad conair is still making this model and that amazon carries it  powerful  it certainly works okay  but   br    br   it s very big  it s quite heavy and you ll need to have a good memory to remember all of the functions  br   i would say this one has been   34 over engineered  34  in the extreme and i m sure as i will  many will go back to their lighter and simpler to use unit  br   a speed  cool and perhaps two or three heat settings are i m sure is what most of us need and want and i feel this baby has just got too many functions to be practical  br   luckily  i purchased this on a very special amazon deal  but truthfully i will just keep this one as a spare  handy little blowdryer  better than leaving one plugged in on vanity  not alot of power though has lots of power to dry hair quickly and it is great for travel  best hairdryer ever  good product excelent fast   love it it is good and i am satisfied i like everything about it except for the night light   it is too bright for me  i love the convenience of not sitting in one spot  but the front part of my hair never dries but the back and sides dries in no time at all  purchased this over two months ago and it is the best hairdryer i ve ever used   i get disappointed whenever i use any other hair dryer because it s simply not the same  very strong power  dries hair fast and easily  perfect temperature for me as well  very happy with my purchase  thank you  it s perfect   adjustable hood height and plenty of room for a head full of rollers  wife love the style and performance  works great for the price  leaves hair shiny  phenomenal product great for travel   and does a nice job styling hair  excellent and very durable hairdryer  this is a heavy quality dryer  no cheap light weight plastic here  comes with 2 attachments  would be nice if it came with a retractable cord  but money well spent nonetheless  it is a little heavier than most hair dryers i have had  i like the fact that high heat does not burn and it has very powerful air flow   wish it wasa little lighter weight  it isn t the stronger dryer i have used  but it is very adequate and it is easy to handle  the shipping was quick and perfect  so if your dryer dies this was a great substitute   thank you  great  its light  efficient and has a super cute design  its even easier to use than my mom s expensive hair dryer  yes it works great spectacular  light weight  compact and an outstanding price   i purchased two   low noise good hair dryer a little noisy  but powerful  small enough to pack  cord is a bit on the short side  but it s perfect for my use  i like that this dryer provides greater heat than my 1800 dryer  however it doesn t put out as much power  it is great i can dry my hair while i put on my makeup  just received  neither of the accessories would fit on the dryer  i would not recommend this to anyone  works fine  works great great product   worked perfect  powerful and small  like the compact convenience of it and am happy this dryer doesn t take over my drawer space  exactly what i needed  love it  this is the best of hair dryer  light weight  efficient  dual voltage and work fine i don t believe the hair dryer is worth the price  all i can say is that it did not out perform my 5 year old   30 conair that i purchased from target  good  i ve owned and used this dryer daily for the last 12 years  works well on my wavy average thick hair  its sturdy and dang near indestructible because its been dropped plenty of times  i ve never considered getting a different one until recently  i think the motor is about to give up the ghost because it shoots out sparks  not to worry  i have not started on fire or lost any hair  but i am noticing more frizz than i have in the past  only complaint is that the filter can not be completely removed to clean it out  has a cover but it doesn t really do much  lots of lint still gets in there   we have to use a q tip and canned air spray to try and remove the lint  i am going to upgrade and see what that gets me  buying  http   www amazon com gp product b00skqft4i ref oh aui detailpage o00 s00 ie utf8 psc 1 will let you know how it compares in a week or so  as an international traveler  i love the dual voltage   dryer does not put out the heat as compared to the dryer it is replacing   blows strong but not hot enough   the  20 conair at costco puts out more heat than this product  this gives one choice of heat and power  it is fast and nice the locking mechanism on the hose is not stable enough to hold the hose securely  if i make a sudden move the hose pops off  very light  fries my hair quickly  like the cool button  love it  works great doesnt over heat  perfect buy  i liked the hair dryer it  it is like the ones at the hair salon  love this blow dryer   hair so much easier to manage with this dryer than my old that just got   34 hot  34   i loved it i had bought this blow dryer in a convenient store and loved it   i went back and purchased an extra one for my guest bathroom for company to use   our family has a lot of birthdays in march and i thought this would be a great gift for my daughters   the convenient store did not have any of these left  so i went to my trusty amazon and bought two from them  all of our daughters have waist length to knee length hair and i have very thick and long hair and it takes us 30 to 45 mins with other dryers to dry our hair   this blow dryer does my hair in 15 mins   i love this thing    we don t understand how some say they get their long hair stuck at the intake in the back of the blow dryer because most women do not have knee length hair and we have never had this issue   if you want a powerful blow dryer  this is the one for you   nice hairdryer  simple and solid  i use mine for drying off my goldendoodle when she s been out in the rain  i really like it for a couple of reasons  the size and also the blower  it is the best i have ever used  br   one problem  i had one before this order and it only lasted a year  great seller and great product  this hair dryer is manageable and leaves my hair perfect  the drier is a bit heavy but other than that  perfect size and it makes wonders great for the guest room works really well  and fun colors for commercial setting they are neat and clean but with heavy everyday use they get about 1 1 5 years before burning out  very happy with the product and would recommend them to other businesses  i will be purchasing more in the future  the hairdryer was good while it lasted but has now burnt out  dead in under two years  i bought it for  26 75 two years ago on amazon prime and now it seems tripple the price  how is that even possible  great product  excellent hair dryer  i love it because i can get very high heat on a low or high blow setting  also it cools down quickly on the cool air setting to lock in styles  just enough blow power and plenty of choices for temp and speed  easy to handle  received a replacement for this one that exploded about 4 6 months ago and that also blew up yesterday    if you use a hairdryer every day this is not the one for you  it would stop half way through drying  and it takes less then ten minutes to dry my hair  and i would have to let it cool off before it would restart  glad i never mounted it  work really nice is awesome        i bought this exact hairdryer more than 5 years ago and i had to buy it again  it s efficient and travels well  love  love  love it    very comfortable to use  controls in the right spot and dries my hair quickly and leaves it smooth and shiny    very happy    and it has sparkles     d i have always had excellent luck with conair hair dryers   my previous one lasted over five years   i have been using this one for a week so far and i love it   it is lightweight and dries your hair quickly  without making you feel like you are going through a wind tunnel    it is a little smaller than my old dryer  so it would also be useful for travel   very nice  the dryer works great   the only reason for not 5 stars is the cord retraction   it sometimes takes three times to get the cord to retract fully  excellent this is a nice tiny size for traveling  but i returned it because it does not have a   34 cool shot  34  button  really nice product  but some times the cord retainer button not working properly very nice  i love the different heat settings and the noise level is really low compared to my old conair hair dryer it is tiny and lightweight but very powerful  it is perfect for travel  doesn t over dry my hair   love it  momma loved it    this hair dryer is light weight and works awesome  i love the multiple settings and the size for travel  so far no issues  great little hair dryer   it quickly dries even a lot of hair  i really like th hair dryer  it drys fast and makes my hair look great  highly recommended  very good working and i like me hear after the ions excellent  but noisier than i thought  best hairdryer i ve ever had  love the ease of cord retraction  great product   the only bad thing was that the wheels didn t fit   works fine  i just wish there was a cool setting for those hot days you have to blow dry your hair  it also seems like it doesn t get as hot as my other hair dryer this size  this works great  we ve had it a few years now and still going strong  has great power   just what i was looking for  bought this for  20 on amazon  sale     nice and quiet compared to the one my wife used to use   i m surprised more women don t have hearing loss from all the noise of these things  lots of power  works great  hair doesn t seem as dry after using   would definitely buy again  worked great with adapter   just follow instructions on proper settings  tons of power  i love this blow dryer  worth the higher price  lightweight and efficient  this is a good buy on a solid dryer that should last for years  good very good love our hair dryers  they are out of the way yet within reach  this is by far the best hair dryer i have ever owned   i have curly hair and have found that the diffuser that comes with it is the best for making my hair have the best curls   i had actually purchased two other hair dryers  one specifically for curly hair  and they didn t work at all   the diffuser on this dryer is the perfect size to get all of my thick hair   not only that  the hair dryer doesn t blow my hair all around when trying to get the right curls   i also love the cool setting feature on the dryer   you won t regret purchasing this hair dryer  good sturdy  not heavy and easy to use  great  good product use it in a motor home and works great  works great   compact  excellent  compact and very powerful  dries your hair very quickly i am very happy with this product seems to work okay  i haven t really had the chance to try it out yet  i pulled it out of the box and tested it  so for now its okay  the hair dryer and attachments are much smaller than i imagined  its a normal size hair dryer  however i m used to a much bigger one by revlon  hopefully this one matches up well to the standards of the revlon products  i figured i couldn t beat the price     good good buy for the money   works perfectly  this hair dryer worked perfectly on my recent trip to holland  belgium  france  and england   there was no converter needed  just an outlet adapter when switched on the 250 v mode and used only on the low setting   to clarify  you can only use it on the low setting  however on the low setting it runs like it is on high   very easy  and worked perfectly   it is also extremely compact for easy packing  but still worked like a bigger  nice hair dryer   hope this helps someone    given as a gift at christmas    awesome product  my sister loves it and she has extremely frizzy hair  i realized a bit too late in my adult life that a good blow dryer makes all the difference in the look and feel of your hair  i simply could not figure out why my hair was always kind of   34 sticky  34  and not quite fully dry when i got out of the shower and tried to dry my hair with my 5  year old conair that i bought at cvs very inexpensively  br   i did some research online and scoffed at the  150  dryers that were being promoted  this one was on the list  and honestly  given the relatively lower price point versus the other professional dryers  i was willing to try it out  br   wow  i have used it now about 3 times  and it is hard to believe what a significant difference i see in my hair  i styled it myself for a formal gala event  and was able to achieve the shiny look  feel  and volume in my hair that any professional stylist could achieve  it was unreal  even on a work day i feel so much better about myself having simply styled my hair with this blow dryer  it targets the hot hair wonderfully and leaves my hair so dry  shiny and healthy  br   i went back and ordered one to send to my mom  she is also a victim of ignorance to bad dryer itis  so i went ahead and sent her the cure  br   happy drying  i absolutely love it  great contr i m using this for about a month and its perfect     fast dryer ever  doesn t harm your hair and the result is like a pro  this product is very good  works great on my fine hair  lots of air  love the heat settings  and the pattern is fun  i purchased this hair dryer after it was recommended by a friend   i absolutely love it   i have long hair and have never been able to dry my hair as quickly as i can with this hair dryer   i can t say enough good things about it and highly recommend it to anyone  we bought two wall mount hairdryers to install at a vacation rental   they work well and are attractive   they are small  don t take up too much wall space and leaves the counter top clear   it was a good choice for us  im a hairstylist  i have 2 of these  super light and dries great  not loud either  compact and easy to use my daughter says that it is easy to use and is fine  great purchase  works perfectly  love it     i love my new rusk  it is a little heavier than i thought it would be  but it is easy to hold  the 4 attachments make any style possible  love this hairdyer    dries my hair in half the time  is so quiet and light in weight   my girlfriend has owned this dryer for years and always has it with her when we travel together   after our last vacation together i decided it was time i owned my own  so far used only one time  but i liked how it handled and it did a good job  it made my hair very puffy   very  very  way too puffy this is a wonderful hair dryer  i would recommend to anyone  if you want it to de frizz and smooth your hair and straighten it then it is a 5 star purchase  well  it just didn t turn on after a year of use  it wasn t dropped or near to a water or anything that might ve caused it to malfunction  br    br   as i was getting ready for my day  it just didn t turn on  i tried to troubleshoot it  reset  use a different plug etc  no luck  second one i have owned  they are great  last forever and very sturdy  excellent  perfect amount of air speed without blowing your hair everywhere like the newer high speed dryers  my second purchase  pricey but excellent dryer  i like quality items  best i ve ever bought  i have long thick hair and it only takes about 5 7 minutes to dry with this blow dryer  love this little blow dryer  works like a regular size dryer    absolutely love new hair dryer    br   exactly what i was wanting  my hair is thick and short and this hair dryer is amazing at getting my hair dried quick    best hairdryer ever    love it  it has a lot of power and works very well  awesome in perfect condition the box was a little beat up but the product is fantastic very nice  compact  high quality dryer with good controls   a good value  works well  good power  able to dry hair quickly  i love this hair dryer  i have long  natural hair  i used to blow dry and flat iron my hair until it started breaking and looking  dead   i heard about this dryer on you tube from   34 sista with real hair  34   i ordered and received it within 3 4 days  no more blow drying for me  great price too  i use it daily  it s good and value for money  do yourself a favor and buy this right now  it s a really good value for the money   it is a bit heavier than i am used to and if just got s bit hotter it would be perfect this is the best compact hairdryer i ever purchased  so much power  a good piece of kit  i chose it for my wife she loves it  so powerful that she rarely uses it on full power  2 wiggles  nice hair dryer but very heavy  ok     it really dosent get that hot  great hair dryer  no complaints this is great    it s really pretty and useful  the delivery is fast  thanks the power of the dryer seems less than i would have thought   still nice  great hair dryer  shipping was very fast  love this hair dryer  this blow dryer seemed to be just what i wanted  but was a huge disappointment   it is very loud as i think one reviewer stated   that i could deal with but that was just one small detail   the attachment for the hair curling i could not work  although that may just be me   the settings for the hot and cold on this are right at the finger tips where you hold the dryer   therefore  if you are not careful you will be drying on warm instead of high   you start wondering why its not getting dry   i have had to change it back as many as 20 times in one hair drying session   and now the last and   most frustrating feature of the dryer   the concentrated hair drying attachment that was stated in the description of the product as coming off for easy cleaning  unlike most other models   well yes  it does come off for easy cleaning alright  it just blows it across the room as you are drying your hair   you just don t want anyone else in the room with you for you never know where the line of fire may be   it blows off with quite a force so i am sure it would hurt someone  particularly a small child   i owned a vidal sassoon dryer before but never one like this   i cannot recommend this product and will not purchase another one of this brand   it was inexpensive so i guess its true  you get what you pay for   not worth paying return shipping so i use it as it is until my new one arrives  amazing dryer   it has cut my drying time down significantly  i have really curly hair   this dryer works very well with my diffuser  i think it is a great value for the money and i m so happy with my purchase  very nice and easy to use   works great  the quality is very good love this dryer especially the cool setting which i use for the first week after i color my hair   it s lightweight and doesn t make a lot of noise  product arrived in perfect condition and have had no issues since it arrived   it was packaged very sustainably and safely  am very satisfied with customer service   totally worth the wait  br   my girlfriend absolutely loved this as a gift  she said the dryer is powerful enough but not hot enough to damage hair will leaving smooth hair and preventing split ends from fraying from the intense heat of a competitor   if you have a significant other with delicate hair this is definitely worth the price and wait   it will pay itself back in no time  br   i say it s worth the wait because you either have to save up enough money to purchase an item of this caliber and also because it is manufactured in italy and takes about two weeks to arrive love having my hair dryer so handy  good quality and lasts a long time    this hairdryer with the brush attachment works very well for drying and straightening out curly hair  a must for everyone with these extra curls  it s also quite nice to have the availability of the two currents that one might use built into this one unit  it will be great for traveling to europe  can a blow dryer be too powerful    the answer is yes   it is very well made but it is so powerful if drys my hair so fast i can t style it with my round brush for a good blow out   resulting in frizz that i have to correct with a flat iron   this was on low setting   the high setting might as well be a jet engine    i m keeping it to use on my poodle because she needs to be dryer quickly   one major plus though it does not get very hot thus limiting the damage you will do  love this hair dryer  great buy fantastic product and a   transaction  i use mine evey day  worth every penny      best and fast it s fine   not much diff between warm and hot settings   pretty standard hair dryer   dries my hair  that s it  good  cheap  decent hairdryer  but doesn t really help my hair s tendency to frizz  also don t like the placement of the   34 cool  34  button  i m always pressing it accidentally  overall  fine but wouldn t buy again  fast shipping  works wonderful for my curls   my perm was mostly straight and dead looking and just using this once with the diffuser made my curls come back to life and the dry damaged hair look go away   i highly recommend this  works as intended  no problems  this is replacing another just like it that we had and it lasted 7  years  can t ask for much more for a blow dryer in this price range  fast delivery great little travel item for me and use it to seal windows plastic liners in winter  price is excellent  great looking hair dryer and works fantastic  silent  hot  and lightweight  so far so good  very pleased at the price top  i bought this to replace my   34 conair infinity pro  34  hairdryer  what attracted me to this andis was the   34 salon grade  34  and the ionic ceramic attributes  overall this is a good hair dryer  but it doesn t blow as hard as the conair it replaced  this was huge for me  as i like a good air flow  it takes longer for my wife to dry her hair because of it  so we went back to our old brand  it does  however  leave your hair   34 silkier  34  which was a surprise to me  i didn t think an ionic dryer could do that  but it does  the two settings it has for wattage didn t seem to make much of a difference  but it s a nice touch  i m sure there s a reason for the option  but i can t think of anything it s useful for  i put it on the high setting and let it go  the retractable cord is nice  but it doesn t reel the cord all the way in  leaving about 16in left dangling  after a few weeks of use  it reels in even less  now leaving about 20 or so inches hanging  br    br   pro  silky hair  somewhat retractable cord  two wattage settings  that i ll prob never use   br   con  takes longer to dry long  thick hair as the air current isn t as strong as i d like  br    br   i wouldn t buy this again or recommend it  but if you don t mind a slightly weaker air flow  the ionic silkiness is worth it  nice velocity and doesn t get too hot   cold button a good feature  love this hair dryer   dries my hair fast and leaves it smooth w no need to iron it   love different temp settings and definately worth every penny   my  stylist owns this same one and said they last a very very long time  love it  would definately buy it again if i had to  love the air pressure on this dryer  i would have given this blow dryer a 5  but the cord needs to be longer   overall it works great though  i purchased this hair dryer because it was dual voltage  and i wished to use it in both the united kingdom and france   it has an american plug  but with a convertor for each country it worked wonderfully   i could not be happier with this purchase   turns out we went to italy too  and with the same french convertor  the dryer worked in italy too  i would recommend this product   compact and powerful   worth for money love it love the arrival time as well  very short cord  was expecting much longer  been using this brand in my bathrooms for years   easy to install  it works great  bought this for limited use to seal windows  having never purchased one before  it worked great  premium hair dryer   does what the discription said it would   light  good looking and not cumbersome  this is a great item my college age daughter loves it awesome this is not the titanium nano portifino  if it is then it was either used or refurbished and not returned to is original state  it overheats and has damaged my hair because it is not working correctly  i know this because i also own the true black titanium nano portifino and it s an incredible hair dryer and my fiance is a stylist  disappointed arrived before promised   so far i am happy with the product  it works great  the dial for timing it s backwards but it works just fine  i have very fine hair and it is not   34 thick  34   so when i go outside on a humid day  the places where my hair is naturally curly curl up worse and the rest loses the style i intended when i left the house  static was a big issue  so when shopping for a blower with high wattage  high heat  yes  i want hot  and high velocity  i found this one hoping it would meet the requirements  i found it to be like most of the drug store blowers in my blower graveyard in the closet  going to the next garage sale  i just did not meet the expectations  not enough blow  heat and i still had frizzy static hair  it works and probably works just fine for those who have thick hair they don t want to damage  but my hair takes 2 minutes flat to dry and style  i did move on and purchased onei mk ii for about  70 taking a really big chance  it blew me away literally and exceeded all expectations  so for fine hair users  it may be worthwhile to shop around since there are very few resources for our types  best hair dryer i have ever had  works great  his dryer replaces my old one which is cumbersome and bulkier   does a great job  very compact  ideal for traveling  i wanted a salon quality dryer and got it   this dryer is fast  easy to work with  not too heavy and does a fantastic job   best i ve ever owned  great buy works well  good ppwer  nice size for travel  would recommend it  good as any other great great value i bought this hair dryer for my mother  she is a hair stylist and swears by it  she says it takes up no space and very convenient when mounted on the wall  works just as good as any other blow dryer she s used  great space saver  this dryer is just cheap   cheap  lightweight  plasticky feeling   granted  it is all of those things but i have a much nicer travel hair dryer that doesn t feel like it is just going to snap in two   unfortunately my other one doesn t have a diffuser which is the sole reason i got this one   but hey  it s only for travel    cheap blower dryer  it doesn t blow dry very hot air but i did buy it for a good price and it works  this is why i gave it 3 stars  small enough to travel but powerful  i like it better than my regular revlon i was using for 3 years  worked great in germany and the uk   just turn the butyon and you are ready for overseas   lightweight   low setying is powerful   highly recommend  was looking for a family hair dryer  got a great deal and works good   we also like the color  the real product is bigger than i expected but it does make your hair look better comparing with other regular dryers  and i love the color    with three teenage girls in the house  the hair dryer gets a lot of use  a lot of use  we ve blown through quite a few hairdryers   no pun intended  this one however  seems to be the clear winner  as a stylishly bald man  i can t personally vouch for it  but the female testimonials are unanimous    this is an excellent product  br    br   full disclosure  the dog isn t a big fan  but she doesn t like baths much either  so can r be surprised  love  love  love this hair dryer   i ve been looking  and trying  for months now  i finally found the perfect one for me   yeah  it s lightweight  small enough to travel and powerful  so easy to use  economical  too   i m going to buy another one for the guest bath   it s hard to locate great hair dryers when you find one that you like in a hotel  for some reason conair puts   34 1875  34  on most all their dryers  so it s hard to tell the actual model number when you find one that you like     glad we were finally able to track this one down  i bought this hairdryer more than year ago when my last one lit on fire  i choose this one because i know the babyliss name and i loved the pattern  the pattern is actually as cute as it looks in the picture  br    br   weight  this dryer weighs about as much as a weighted tape dispenser  it feels like a professional hair dryer and is not easy to break  br    br   design  the cord on the dryer is somewhat rigid and unwieldy  it became easier to wrangle when i bought velcro ties for the cord  on amazon  velcro brand   one wrap thin self gripping cable ties  reusable  light duty   8  34  x 1 2  34  ties  100 pack   black  br    br   speed of drying  i can t say much here  after all  it is just blowing hot air  but i guess that i can say that it dries quickly  br    br   temperature  the hot setting gets pretty hot  not hot enough to burn your scalp  but hot enough to get the job done  i love this dryer  i use it as both my everyday dryer and my travel dryer  it s just as powerful as a full size but without the weight and bulk  i m seriously never going back to a full size dryer again  dryers my hair super fast and no frizz just love it   freedom from the hooded dryer   works okay  but very heavy  good air flow  fairly quiet  seems like good construction  location of the buttons makes them easy to switch unintentionally  i think this is a winner at around twenty six bucks delivered  great design base could be more sturdy great dryer makes my hair feel like silk has a good volume of air on high for a compact unit  but the trade off is it is a bit noisy too   not mention in the listing  but the blue button is a cool air button and works as would be expected   unlike the revlon rvdr5033 i had the cool button on this unit just turns the heat off and back on when released and does not change the fan   it gets very hot on high and so did the revlon   too hot it seems to me but it appears no one makes a 1500 watt model anymore   i could find nothing but 1875 watt models even in compact   not pictured or mentioned but this one like all of them has the huge block on the cord end with a gfi and ac plug as part of that block   even though they tell you not to put two gfi s on the same circuit and there hasn t been a house built in almost 40 years without a gfi covering any outlet in every bathroom the requirement for this still persists   i like that you can easily take the cover of the fan in the rear for cleaning   not many of the compact models seem to have that feature   overall a good unit   time will tell how durable and long lasting it is   i can only hope it is as good in that area as the one it replaced   update 7 21 15  well it is not very long lasting   about 4 months in it suddenly started smoking and got very hot very fast did some nice sparking and arcing  then quit   we will see if they honor the warranty  great size and does a good job  the detachable black diffuser piece is extremely hard to get off  at least mine was  so consider whether you will take it off and on often  best hair dryer i ve ever owned   i m very happy with the quality of the product  it didn t fit me   i was not tall  to fit under it so i had to sit on a big chair couton  to fit my head under it    i had one befor that the neck part went up or down and i though this one did it too   i ve been looking for a good deal on a hair dryer for weeks and finally came across this one  great purchase  fantastic hair dryer love it    it is adequate  i do wish the prongs of the diffuser were a more flexible or softer  it kind of hurts our heads  this is a great little hairdryer   i ordered it for travel   it s a little heavy and large for a travel dryer but most travel dryers are loud and cheap and take forever to dry your hair   this one is as powerful as a full size dryer   if suitcase space isn t an issue  this is the dryer for you  it dray my hair so quickly  blow hot air  perfect  small but powerful  great product excellent very good product works very well thus far  i am small with shoulder problems and this is very compact and light weight   it packs a punch with power  excellent item does what its suppose to do  like the ability to clean it  very good love this hair dryer  dries my hair in no time the nano technology is great  blow dry is much faster than regular product  keep my hair style nice  no dryness   i m  in love with this hair dryer it s small but really dry s my hair fast and does a wonderful job  it took me a while to find a blow dryer that actually made it easier to do my hair   usually my hair would still be super fluffy and still kind of tangled after blow drying   i have really kinky curls and after using this my hair was almost straight   i only used a flat iron so it would be sleek but this blow dryer really works   it made my hair shiny and straight and it gets really hot which helps a great deal  i totally recommend this blow dryer to anyone especially if you have kinky curly hair like my self   i had one before and i love it   it s off the counter and out of the way  works great  looks good on wall  works great  i love the cord keeper conair dryers   much easier to store   my old conair cord keeper  less expensive  2 speed  2 heat settings  wore out at the plug   couldn t be without a blow dryer so looked to trusty amazon   i saw this model and read the reviews   i liked that it had a cool setting and didn t have to keep the button pushed for the cool shot   i also like that it has the cord keeper   but the best feature about it  in my opinion  is that it is much quieter than the less expensive model   i get ready for work in the early mornings and this model produces a moderate hum  compared to the blasting roar the cheaper model makes   if a quieter blow dryer is what you re looking for  with 1875 power  this is your dryer   worth the extra money     buy it  you won t be sorry   super fast delivery   ps  use the concentrator nozzle  cuts down on frizz  this hair dryer met all of my expectations  i love its compact design  the bonnet is large enough to fit over rollers  and on the medium heat setting it gets warm enough to dry my hair in 10 minutes  i think it s a quality product with a thoughtful design  works great  night light still works and we ve had it over a year  i have long curly hair 3b  i bought this dyer thinking it would work wonders on my hair  first  i think it does a great job and dries my hair very fast  however  i would prefer to have the teeth longer and better way to cup the hair so to speak  my hair gets caught in the back and ends up with tge burning hair smell  secondly  i bought this dyer 6 weeks ago and it s already broken  amazon is amazing and agreed to refund my money  i think this would work better for women with short curly hair more than anything  love it  it fits on the wall and it s out of the way  nite lite is bright also bought one of these for a spare bedroom when we have guests  took a shower in there one day and loved this so much i threw mine away and bought one for myself too  operates like a very cheap hairdryer  we bought for our 10yr old daughter and it s fine for her  takes longer to dry hair than most  we may just have a fluke    works well but extremely loud  so far so good   my husband ordered it  but we both use it   have had a similar  one before and used it for years  br   hoping this one last as long  this blow dryer was heavy and too hot   at the time of purchase this product there were plenty in stock  as soon as i got mine delivered  the product page shows this product is no longer available  anyway  i returned it and got the babyliss one  much happier with the other purchase  this is much lighter than the older model i had and love the different speeds and power  great  light is too bright i love this dryer cheap and enough for normal use  good product i love the smaller size of this hair dryer  which makes it great for travel  at 1875w  it s also still powerful enough to dry my medium length  thick hair   if you have thinner or shorter hair  it might be a good idea to dry your hair on the lower setting   i also really like that this comes with two different diffusers  making it easier to achieve the style i want when drying my hair  this product was provided for testing purposes  but all opinions are my own  chose this particular hair dryer after comparing the features with other similar products  i am so glad that i went with this one because it is the best hair dryer i have ever had   ever   i am not even talking about the fact that drying my hair time is cut in half  but what is really amazing that my hair looks so much better  it suddenly has some shine  including the ends that use to look very frizzy  and that is not all  i use round brush  while drying my hair and now that is enough to lift the roots of my hair   i use to use a product that suppose to help lift the roots and i hated because that product was smelly and it really wasn t doing much   but now this amazing hair dryer makes my hair look healthy and even fuller because of the lift  br   i love it   as always  the oster wall hair dryer is convenient and i am satisfied  although  my previous ones from many years ago were somewhat smaller  this blow dryer is great   i use it all the time   mainly on extensions   have not tried it on natural hair  4a 4c  yet   it should be fine   makes drying my hair so much faster and easier just what i wonted  love it i can move around and sleep in it  true story    i have spent approximately  500  700 on different hair and blow dryers  i have all from the cheap ones to the expensive ones and this is by far the best damn blow hair dryer i ve owned  i am a black woman with natural 4c hair that means thick and coarse and typically when blow drying my hair it feels crunchy but this dryer did not make my hair feel like that  of course i used the loc method with alikay naturals products before blow drying my hair and it turned out straight like i needed it to be  i m super happy and satisfied  also i used the hair pick yo blow dry my hair and it did not pop off nor did i break the teeth in the pick  dynamite   if it pick does pop off just use heat resistant double side tape to keep it on  excellent and efficient  i should have read through more of the reviews   this is definitely not the hair dryer you want if you have arthritis       my husband has no issues and even he thinks it s too heavy   it blows great   no complaints there   just absolutely not the hair dryer for you if you have small hands or arthritis  really good product  it is good  wasn t what i expected   thought it would have been more powerful  this is a really neat  compact hair dryer  it dried my shoulder length hair pretty quickly   i did not use the concentrator nozzle for getting my hair dry  but i did use the thin nozzle with a round brush for styling purposes   i really liked that this hair dryer has 3 speed settings  2 heat settings  and a cool shot function   i used all 3 of these   the cool shot function is probably my favorite  it really   34 sets  34  your style in place   the hair dryer is pretty light and the handle is ergonomically designed to feel good in your hand  and it does   i do have to mention that the first time i used it  there was a distinct burning smell  i was a little concerned about it  but after about a minute or so into use  it stopped and i haven t noticed it again since   also  the cord on this hair dryer is thick  as in it is not going to twist and kink up  it is a quality cord that it going to last a long time  br     all in all  this is a really good hair dryer   if you are looking for something on the smaller side  something lightweight  that does a great job quickly  this is a good option  br    br   anemone wind flower professional ionic ceramic hair dryer provided by xtava  i needed a small hair dryer that would fit in a guest bathroom vanity drawer  and this one not only fit but also works well   with 1875 watts  it dries even thick hair quickly when used on the high setting   the handle folds to make it more compact for storage  br    br   this is a basic hair dryer wiith only two speeds  high and low  and one temperature unless you hold down the   34 cool  34  button at the top of the handle   it doesn t have the bells and whistles of more expensive models    no ceramic coils or diffuser or ionic upgrades   the handle has a switch to convert from 125 v to 250 v  and you must know the voltage of the country you re visiting and manually change the setting or else risk starting a fire   remember to change it back when you get home   a few countries  however  use lower voltages than 125  many caribbean countries  japan  taiwan  and a few south american countries   check your destination before you go   the hair dryer would be completely universal if the power pack handled a range between 100 250 v   it would also be more useful if it converted automatically the way computer chargers do  however  i ve never seen an automatic conversion on a hair dryer  br    br   on american current  this is a powerful little hair dryer   although most hotels supply hair dryers these days  it works well for those times when either you re not sure you ll find one and when you want to depend on something you know  br    br      debbie lee wesselmann thanks i love it s compact design and it perfectly dries my hair within minutes  my 4 star review is due to the concentrator it fells off atleast once in your 5 minute use which is a pain  if that doesn t bother you then this is the perfect dryer which doesn t occupy a lot of space like other fancy ones  great hair dryer  drys hair quickly and without allot of noise a must have for any girl  it really has revolutionized hair dryers and i gotta admit i have owned a ton  the drying time is crazy fast  truly one of my best purchases i have made on amazon     br   thanks amazon  very happy with this dryer as my last one was getting way too hot and frying my hair   it s not too heavy nor too loud   all in all  i would recommend this product   this thing has so much power  it will nearly blow the hair right off your head        my previous yellow bird lasted over 12 years   great for curly stubborn hair   a real workhorse   product was delivered within 2 days  great product   cuts dry time in half when compared to other dryers   purchased my own and when my daughter borrowed it she loved it so i ordered another for her as a gift   great product at a reasonable price  great nearly set my hair alight and blew all the sockets in the house  br   item returned and refund awaiting  do not trust it  this dryer has alot of power  different heating settings   i was just use to one  well worth the money  i have looked around and this is cheaper and a better product  well worth buying size is a little large but it works really well love the retractable cord  i received this in the mail and it came in a cute box packaged nice and tight  br   it was shipped in a timely manner and came to me in perfect condition  br   i love how compact this blow dryer is    i can take it with me when i go on vacation and it wont take up valuable space in my suitcase    br   i have the pink and black one and it is super cute   i love how stylish it is  br   it comes with 2 attachments   diffusers    one is wider than the other one  br   they are easy to attach and easy to use  i love to use mine after blow drying my hair without one for a few minutes and then finishing off with the diffuser  leaving my hair shiny and soft  br   the cord is long enough to be able to set at a table and dry your hair if need be the cord is strong and sturdy so it should last a long time  br   the dryer itself is very powerful   i could not believe how hard it actually blows   it comes with settings so that you can pick the one right for you and your hair   br   i received this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and i really think this is a great blow dryer and has a great price   br   i will be using this for years to come   nice design and the night light is an added bonus  great dryer  and very cheap too  very heavy for a small dryer but quality was great  drys my hair very quickly and packs nicely  i use this as a travel dryer  this is perfect for curly hair  the difuser piece gets popped in when you receive it and it does not fall out  its there to stay  i love this product  i love it    i have had the remington blow dryer for 5 years but unfortunately i left it at my daughters home   i have called a few times to get her to ship it back but she keeps forgetting so i bought another   love it just as well as my older one and looks the same except for color   found out my daughter loved the blow dryer which is why she kept forgetting to mail it back to me   we both would recommend this hair blower    especially if you have thick hair like we do   it works great  this item died after maybe the 10th time i used it  good thing it is inexpensive  save your money and dont buy this  keep looking  installation was easy  have not used it yet  not too big or bulky  love it  drys my hair fast and now i can dry with one hand instead of two hands  it gets really hot two  only use the small comb attachment  i wish it had a thicker brush attachment  the wattage is great   however  the heat and fan controls seem to be in the way  on  the handle   i need to    34 choke up  34  closer to the heating area so that i don t accidentally move the settings  when i ordered this hair dryer  i ordered the black with pink petals  what i received was an all pink hair dryer  i was a little disappointed that i didn t receive the actual hair dryer that i ordered and i believe that the other hair dryer might have been better than this one  i have ordered other hair dryers from xtava in the past and have been really impressed with the quality and performance of the hair dryers  this hair dryer is nice and small  so it is compact and easily fits even in a drawer  even though it is small it is a powerful hair dryer and does dry my hair without frizzing it  to me it seemed a little heavy for it being such a small dryer  it was actually louder than my bigger hair dryers  it does have a nice long cord so i am able to move around more and not be confined in standing in one place  it does come with 2 attachments 1 nozzle is long and thin and the other is shorter and wider  it does have 3 heat selections  low  medium and high  and does have 2 speeds  gentle and strong   the feature i like the best about the dryer is the cool air which shoots out a burst of cool air and that is why my hair doesn t frizz when using this dryer  br    i was able to receive this hair dryer so that i can provide my honest opinion and feedback  the retractable cord is awesome and the airflow is good  very nice product  this is absolutely the best hand hair dryer i have every had   i have 4b hair natural   and it dries my hair in less time and straight   you will not go wrong with this the anemone wind flower 1875 blow dryer is amazing     i love it and so does the rest of my family  it has multiple heat speeds and a cold shot and trust me it gets cool   i put it on cold for me to feel and it was nice   it dried my hair in a lot less time than most other blow dryers do and it comes with two removable nozzles so that you can dry your hair anyway you want to  i m still stunned at how fast my hair dried  i have been through so many hair dryers and none of them came close to being this great   i love the colors of it  the blue and black are perfect for me since that is my favorite colors   br   i have long hair  not short so normally it really does take a lot of time to dry my hair  i m in love with this blow dryer  i love that you have the choice of the colors  they are both really nice looking  this is such a amazing price for such a awesome hair dryer    i will end up buying another one just for my daughter to have so she leaves mine alone   br   i received this at little or at no cost to review and to give my unbias opinion and that is exactly what i have done  i wish i could take a picture but the picture posted is exactly what it looks like   not as powerful on lower power we actually bought this for drying the dog after his baths  he likes it a lot better than the others because it is much quieter on the low speed than what we used before  br   if you are in a hurry though  the high setting blows a lot of air  just not quite as much as your typical politician  for the price this is a good drier  it did get a little heavy while i was drying my hair  but i did think my hair looked shinier after  i would not call it professional quality by any means  i would say it is worth it if you re just looking for a good cheap hair dryer  why wasn t i using a remington before  these are way better than the one i was using before from revlon  br    br   10 stars  this works good  but not as good as my old one that i got at walmart for  15 00   it s a little heavy and somewhat bulky but i like the fact that the cord recoils inside   it keeps it out of the way  but the cord is not very long so you must stay close to the outlet   i have very long hair and my old blow dryer dries my hair a lot faster than this one does  i had no need for the attachements so i tossed them in the trash   it works ok  nothing to write home about  picked this out after using it in a hotel  i ve had it in 3 or 4 hotels since then  it has a medium speed which is rare  and the cool setting  which i love  and it was reasonably priced  love it very nice and lighter weight than previous models   dries well  a very good value for the money   the on off switch is a little hard for arthritic hands to use  but not a deal breaker   dries my wifes curly hair very quickly  this hairdryer is a definite upgrade from my old conair one   it is fast  and seems to leave my hair nice and shiny  my hair still seems a bit frizzy on top  but that could just be my hair or that fact that i live in a very humid climate   the volume is pretty good   i don t know if i would necessarily call it   34 quiet  34  though  the weight is also decent  but i would not say it is extremely light or anything  i read on at least one of the other reviews that the power cord was just a regualr plug  but mine was one of those safety kinds   overall  it is a great hairdryer for the price  love this blowdryer  don t like how the nozzle on the front pops off on it s own  but it has reduced frizz  quality hair dryer  this really moves some air  great product looks and preformance  when we got this hair dryer we wanted one that wouldn t cause fly away hair  this certainly lives up to the claims  also this dryer has individual controls for speed and heat  i really like that  because most of the time i don t need high heat but do want more blowing power  it also isn t very noisy as far as hair dryers go  it works great  these dryers are the best  last forever powerful hair dryer  adding volume to your hair  the hot mode could be super hot so you get to be careful  best blow dry ever  i have been buying these for years    good product for an amazing price  great hair dryer  dries my hair great for thick hair  love it  perfect for travelling  i used this when i went to norway last spring  not only did it work well with the converter  it was also very high powered for such a small dryer  i had 2 originals of these hair dryers they worked great for years   i still have one but one the other one broke i reordered this one must have cheaper parts it completely broke in 5 months i had a cord keeper for years   this is a nice hair dryer with all the options and attachments i need   it is a bit larger than my older version   i will keep looking for one that is lighter weight and smaller   i really  really liked my older one  have it mounted in the not quite finished bathroom yet   looks good so far   but haven t used it yet  this is my second time buying this hair blower  i love it so much  this is a nice replacement for my old hair dryer   all 3 attachments work great for however i want to style my hair   this dryer motor is occasionally  makes a loud grinding sound but it continues to work  works great  this dryer is fantastic  hair is silky and smooth when dry and if you purchase the attachment it does a good job of straightening hair while drying it  i would purchase again  i travel frequently and love this hairdryer because the dual voltage allows me to use it anywhere and it is light to handle and small to pack in my luggage  does the job  dries my hair  not fast  but it also doesn t seem to make my hair like a burnt crisp  so  all good  it s an ok drier but there are so many better options out there with a stronger motor  the airflow is weak even on the highest setting  it says its a 1875w drier but it dries the hair more like a 1200w one  also it is quite bulky  it does reduce frizz and improve the shine  br    br   i recommend it to a person with short and fine hair  if you have coarse or curly hair  i wouldn t pick this one  arrived ahead of schedule  good price  just what we wanted  size is great and very compact  love it and use it daily   so convenient  where has this been my whole life     this is honestly the best hair dryer ever  great product i read reviews so kept my unit on low  wow   low gets really hot so it does the job so far woo hoo      very good  pleasantly surprise this dryer is awesome  the accessory allows me to pinpoint a section of hair for styling drying purposes and has a cool setting which sets the style in place  handle does not fold in but luckily i have drawer space  excellent  excellent product  very good at relationship between quality vs price  recommended 100  is kind of different to the picture one  but the stylish on my hair it was as expected i gave it one star because there are none lower   it did not work in israel even though we had top of the line converters   in america  it was wimpy and hard to hold   the voltage switcher on the dryer did not really exist   find another one  good great hairdryer  powerful but not too heavy and bulky  like it very much  great hairdryer and very quiet  so far  i like this hair dryer   it is very strong and has really helped cut down on my dry time  great  love it good hairdryer  two buttons means you can control the fan speed and temperature  independently  which is a very good thing   this is a good hair dryer  better than the discount store cheapies  but it is a good price  and good quality too   highly recommended  this is the best    works great for hair  annnd my hubby decided to use it to take decals off our truck     he used it for 4 hrs straight on high heat and i was a bit nervous it would die out on me pretty quick afterward but its 4 mos later and still as good as when i bought it   very happy with this product   my wife like the power and size   i think it is a bit loud   easy to mount and it doesn t take up much space  great power   i shouldn t have waited so long to purchase it   dries hair more quickly than any other dryer   by far   worth the extra money  my previous dryer finally died   i really like this one   it doesn t collapse  but that was one of the breaking points on my previous one   i like the  variation in temperatures   speed   i took off the nozzle because it seemed to concentrate the air too much    i don t really like to spend too much time on my hair  just the minimum to make it look good   the diffuser seems pretty good  but i haven t tried to dry my hair curly yet   i really like that the back vent can be cleaned  great blow dryer definitely better then i was expecting bought for a present  was well liked  great for traveling  it takes up very little space and weighs next to nothing  i decided to purchase this hair dryer after using it during a recent hotel stay   i was drawn to the fact that it does not emanate the same high pitched tone that my prior conair makes  which is also an 1875 but has added features such as cool air and turbo settings    i m very happy with my purchase   the hair dryer is very lightweight  cheap  and hot enough to get the job done   most importantly to me  i don t feel like i m damaging my hearing when i use it   i highly recommend it  excellent dryer for the price  i ve owned hot tools and other conair dryers in the past  and so far this one has been the best  i bought this one to replace my older model conair dryer that went out after 4 years of use  i really like that this one has the switch for the cool setting  rather than having to hold the blue button to get the cold blast  although it still has that button as an option   it s not as quiet as my last dryer  but my hair gets dryer faster without drying out the ends or creating static  my hair actually looks more shiny silky after using this one than it did with the older model  excellent produce for the price  this is a great little hairdryer   folds nicely   wish it had a retractable cord  though  nice xtava rimini 1800w iconic hair dryer with diffuser is awesome  it s light weight  heats up quickly and works wonderfully  the diffuser helps keep hair frizz free and shiny  which is great  there are not only three heat levels  but two power levels  so there are loads of options to get the perfect setting for you   br    br   i am thrilled to have had the opportunity to review this xtava hair dryer  all opinions are my own and not influenced in any way  just wish the tube was longer  if your hair is too near the air intake  it sucks it in  otherwise very good product  nice and lightweight  awesome the best wall mounted dryer i ve found   i also love the little night light as it s enough to light my way to the bathroom at night  way better than my previous dryer  i was cheap  i was trying to save money for a while    in the worst ways possible  i ended up buying this  11 dryer because it was cheap   and for a year  i went around with wet hair  i tried to tell myself that it was okay because of all the money i was saving  but it did not feel okay  i finally ended up getting this dryer though and it was like night and day  this dryer works so quickly  it makes you save time and time is the most precious resource of all  it will dry hair quickly and efficiently   i do not use any of the attachments that come with it  but if you style your hair  just know  those are options too  just with the bonnet was easier to fit over rollers  but otherwise a good machine  i love the item  it has become very much easier to dry my dreds  thank you  i really like this little helper and bought a second one for a friend  i find that my travel sized hairdryer works best in this  the best dryer ever  i go through hair dryers like crazy  finally i have found one i love  perfect size for travel but still really powerful  good its super loud and kind of heavy  i dont really know if i like it  dont recommend love this  looks and works great drys my hair fast and effectively   i love it  i have been trying to find one for two years  i had a   34 professional  34  hair dryer and it broke  i picked this one based on the reviews and the price and i love it  it takes me 15 min to dry my medium hair and it doesnt cause a lot of frizz  i like the silky feel this hair dryer gives my hair   i bought the same kind to replace an old one  great dryer  convenient wall access great for blowouts    as much as i hate to admit it  in conjunction with the cricket technique 400 thermal brush  my hair is as closest to a salon blowout as i have ever gotten it  it feels light and airy like it does when i leave my hairdresser  it is relatively quiet  the design is very nice   i like the smoothness of the handle  love that it comes with concentrator and diffuser as i use both since i have naturally curly curly hair  i am pleased with this and will update later if need be because i just received it in the mail today  i also have long hair and didn t have a problem with the back as some others have  best hairdryer ever  i had on of these for 12 years   it finally gave up the ghost   works perfectly and is so convenient to have right on the bathroom wall   added bonus   more wattage with the new one  i like the temperature settings of cool  warm and hot but would like this dryer more if the flow of air were stronger when set on high   it seems to take longer for my hair to dry with this dryer  amazing best blowdryer ever   this is my second t3 because the airline broke my first one pitching my luggage  drys super fast and less damaging  love works  retractable cord is nice i have not had chance to use it allot  but so far so good    so far works well  i purchased this for my vacation home   i liked it so much i brought it home and took the more expensive dryer i was using at home to my vacation home  as advertised  works great much faster than my precious dryer  the buttons on the handle are a bit awkward but i ll get used to it  cons  too big to be a good travel dryer not very powerful  even on the highest setting takes a long time to dry my hair  and it    s super short does not seem very sturdy  pros  relatively quiet decreases frizz this unit began to self destruct this morning discharging internal shrapnal and vibrating while releasing a death sound  br   despite being treated with the utmost respect it will join the pile of cheap chinese junk i have accumulated over the years br   it almost made it to it s second birthday  pitiful br   i purchased a panasonic and a seperate wall bracket as a replacement br   it is most likely chinese made as well but the design should long outlast generics i amd black and i have natural hair and i can tell you that this blowdryer will be perfect for anyone  no complaint  it is very powerful for the size  was great while it lasted  but the first time i tripped over the cord it toppled over and never worked again   and it had been 90 days  so no refund or exchange  i bought this as a gift br   and the person really likes this excellent product  recommended  this hairdryer is great   it has 3 choices of speed and 3 heat settings  cool  warm and hot   this is the best hairdryer i ve ever had   it s a hair dryer  i don t think it s horrible  but it s not spectacular  not like some of the other xtava products i have used in the past  it doesn t look it  but it is lightweight and it s a really nice color blue  it comes with two attachments  a big customized diffuser and a concentrated nozzle for targeting styling  the diffuser was a little difficult to get on  it didn t fit as good as the concentrated nozzle  i also liked that it has a long cord which made it easier for me to move around when needed  this rimini hair dryer comes with three heat levels  two power levels and a cool shot button to set your style  the different settings and attachments did make it easier when styling my hair  i could set them to what ever i needed them to be  when i needed them  i ve never uses such a big diffuser like this before  it did dry my hair quickly  but i have very fine hair  so i don t need a lot of heat  it did help with the frizz and left my hair feeling smooth  i felt that it could have had a bit more power to it  but it was okay  for people with thicker hair  it might take a little longer to dry  overall  this hair dryer was not bad  it does what a hair dryer is suppose to do and gets the job done  it s very easy to use and with all the different settings and attachments  it s convenient too  br    br   disclosure  i was not financially compensated for this post  the opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product  i received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion  regardless  i will only recommend products or services i use personally and or believe will be good for my readers  this blow dryer is the first i have owned that truly fits my needs  i have very  very curly hair so i am always looking for ways and tools that maky hair maintenance easier  this blow dryer works magic on my hair  it straightens it so fast which really saves me on time  i have small hands so the way this dryer is shaped makes it easy to hold and use  it isn t very heavy which adds to its ease of use  br    br   out of the three attachments  i use the   34 big comb  34  right after washing my hair and the   34 small comb  34  for touch ups  i would say without a good thermal balm  heat protectant  etc    it make be a little freezy  since my hair is so curly  i am uses to using such products so if you dont  you may want to  br    br   the heat dial only has 3 ranges which i thought would be an issue  i would say medium is good for most people  i have never had a problem with not getting the right temperature for my needs  br    br   overall  i am happy with my purchase  it doesnt break the bank yet works better than any other blow dryer i have had  it saves me a lot of time because of how good of a job it does  i would consider this a must buy  arrived when it was supposed to  dries my hair super fast  nice feel to the dryer  great price  what more can you ask for  in the beginning things were fine   i just started using it  2weeks ago even though i bought it months ago  with 2week 3 times a week  of use the thing has already died on me  this is not something  i would buy again  it didn t flat out die   it started declining in performance  dries my hair fast i needed a new hair dryer as my girlfriend borrowed my babyliss pro tt   the remington works great   everything works as it should and it puts out a bunch of air and cools down quickly when you are through using it   easy to regulate the temperature and the unit has great fit and finish   the one item worth noting is that the remington is about a quarter pound heavier than the babyliss which may be an issue if you use it for long periods of time   i highly recommend this hair dryer  pretty design  however i didn t notice any difference in lack of frizz or shine that is associated with ionic dryers  very well made  ergonomics is perfect  it has a dust filter that you can remove and clean out  the plug has a breaker switch  the main power switch is in the handle  this dryer can be used in a salon setting  great love the diverse settings  does a great job of drying my thick hair quicker than other dryers i have tried  i am extremely happy that i purchased this hair dryer   i have lots of fine hair and it dries my hair in about 30 35 minutes   it does get pretty hot so i suggest a setting around 50   55   it   very top heavy so heed the directions and secure it somehow   i do have to say  the first thing my husband said when he saw it was   re you going to the moon     as it does look like a space helmet   the directions are not very clear but i managed to put it together just fine by myself and it   very sturdy   i definitely would recommend this dryer  this is a good hair dryer   it s the 4th one that i ve bought over several years  excellent  small  no negatives  i love that this comes with a little diffuser  for a little guy  it does a very good job  good settings nice flow real smooth very compact  easy for travel packing  and works very well  for such  a small dryer  it packs a lot of power  and barely takes much longer than my full size dryer  to to it s job  folds  and takes up 1 3 the space though  and comes with a cute case  and 2 attachments great dryer except that the retractable cord stops completely retracting   i replaced the first one under warranty after about 9 months   within about another 9 months the second dryer s retractable cord would not retract completely   i followed the directions as to how to retract the cord   the warranty only covers 12 months from original purchase date so i am now out of luck as far as getting a new one  better than any hair dryer i have had  great product  it has several heat settings and several speeds   the options are great  works great  looks great  works great  cord isn t too short  a pet peeve   and i love that it has more than 2 settings like many dryers these days  i can even give my dogs a little help drying off in the winter since i can change up the settings the moment it s a bit too hot or cool without going too far the opposite direction  really liking the product so far  for me  conair has always delivered  great product  have used similar dryer for 20 years in 2 bathrooms  this model seems quieter but still has the power  love it  small but powerful  good value  great price  this has met all my expectations   very happy with product she loves it  it performs better than expected  congrats on selling a great product and thanks for asking  first amazon review    so i bought this hair dryer as my main hairdryer at home  i typically use the warm setting  overall  great finish and works very well  despite me using the warm  not hot  setting  the thin film of plastic over the barrel and handle slowly started to peel off  not a big deal  but definitely worth noting  in case that bothers you  it s doesn t look so pretty now  and i ve had it for about a year  br    br   overall  great value for the money and excellent results  but the packaging i d give a 4 10  they could have done better  it is beautiful  i ordered a white one  i really like this color   the size is good and it has really nice design  i got it on time  i love it so much  it is easy to take  i have long thick hair and it usually takes a long time to blow dry  not with this dryer  it is the best one i ever had  i could not believe the price was so good  love it  great buy for great price  strong and powerful  however  it s a little too powerful for me  i was looking for a light dryer and this one works  it s not super light but it s also not too heavy and i didnt want to go through the hassle of returning  pretty good  not any better than other hair dryers in that price range  love this product  nifty compact is a plus  can be taken anywhere  use to steam or dry hair  bought this to replace a sunbeam 1500 and was very happy to find that the wall mount was compatible  br   comparing the 2  the sunbeam had 3 speeds  of which i only used the upper 2  and the oster has 2 speeds  the  upper 2   i have curly hair  this diffuser is perfect for getting curls to look defined without the frizz  wonderful product  i love it  works great and pretty color  great hair dryer  seem like package could have been shipped out sooner  but it arrived when promised  great product   brand new  used the dryer for 2 yrs up until my lil client touched it   it dropped  had to duck tape it together for awhile until the new one arrived but it still worked wonders  love  love this dryer  great size  and noise level  as described   works great  this xtava rimini 1800 w hair dryer totally blew me away  it is a powerful 1800 watt hair dryer comes with a customized diffuser and concentration nozzle for precise styling and maximized condensed air flow which makes it superb for achieving the absolute perfect desired look  br   i am a licensed cosmetologist and i can tell you from experience that this hair dryer is professional quality and is exactly what i would use in my home salon  it is adjustable with three heat levels and two power levels to achieve complete control of your styling and lock in your perfect look with the cool shot button  br    styling hair is an art and a stylist is only as good as her tools  this dryer is a top of the line styling tool which means it saves me time and energy while i am styling and i get the desired look almost instantly  br   say goodbye to frizz with this iconic hair dryer because it s designed to emit powerful negative ions to seal and smooth the hair s outer layer while it increases my hair s own natural shine while providing me with healthy and hydrated hair  the xtava rimini 1800w hair dryer has totally exceeded my expectations  br   disclaimer  i received the allure hair dryer during a promotion in exchange i would tell you what i thought about the allure in this review  all statements made are solely my own and are based on my own personal experience while using this hair dryer  that being said  i would absolutely recommend this hair dryer to persons of all ages  it works better than great  its a blow dryer  lol  i docked a star because it has a weaker output than my old blow dryer   i appreciate the cold setting  good product  did not have problems so far and work as expected  i was skeptical about purchasing this after reading several of the reviews  however  this blow dryer is amazing   i have very thick  course  wavy  shoulder length hair   with traditional conair blow dryers from walmart  i would spend 10 minutes blow drying my hair and it would be left really dry and frizzy   i thought that was how all blow dryers would affect my hair   wrong   with this dryer  it now takes me 3 4 minutes to dry my hair and leaves it with a moisturized sheen   i almost cried the first time i used it   yes  if you hold the handle too low you can accidentally press the buttons  however  to modify that i simply hold it higher up and have no problems   when this one dies  i m most definitely buying another     especially at such a great discounted price  wonderful  haven t received it yet but looks good on the positive reviews works great   i love it    the buttons are a bet hard at times   mostly bc my old hands dont work as well as  they used to    but i would recommend and buy again   great price  and quality     does a great job i love  love this hair dryer  it has great power and dries my hair rather quickly  would highly recommend  this gets a 5  star in my book   i ve used for a few weeks now and it dries my hair faster  smoother  and the 2 directional heads are perfect for directing the heat exactly where you want it to go   it is so much better than my conair that i had   this is high end quality  excellent good great little travel dryer  works almost as good as a full size one  great little dryer and very reasonably priced  i bought this for my elderly mother   her hand held dryer had ceased working so this little dryer was the ticket  it is lightweight  small   easy to store  easy to use and it blows warm and cool air to dry my mother s hair  the most important part    she likes it  so what s not to love  you can tell right away this is a heavy duty hair dryer  i wanted something that had some power to it and couldn t find it at my local target   this is a great product  i have been practicing blow outs and its prefect for this   so as much as this is more pricey than a normal blow dryer it is worth it  it dries hair quickly and it s not to loud  first tried this at a hyatt hotel  loved it and now i own my own  great for travel or everyday use  i had a really old hair dryer   so this one to me is awesome    it s not too noisy and it dries my hair quickly  seems to work just fine  good price  no problems so far  compact and conveniently portable   dryer is not very powerful  so the brush it pretty much useless for my hair   surprisingly this dryer is not even as powerful as my handheld blow dryer   bonnet works fine as long as you are satisfied with the low moderate heat  love it   perfect  best hairdryer i have had better  not very hot  i love this hair dryer   i went on vacation and there was one in my room   i loved it so much i came home and searched for it til i found it   amazon had the best price for this model   when it came  i was not disappointed   if you like your dryer to have a lot of force to it  this is the one  it is a great space saver and it works very well  amazing   very short drying time with no frizz  best hair dryer ever really love it  my hair looked better than ever  dried about 3 4 times faster  drier is lighter and easier to work with when styling  br   dropped it accidentally and nothing was broken  br   drying seems enjoyable   br   have only used twice  but am glad that i bought it  for the price paid  it is an  excellent buy   i bought 3 so i would not worry about having a bad hair day without a hair dryer   this hair dryer is simple and get the job done   either hot or cold   would be great if a third option available for hotter air  great dryer  br    br   has cut her hair drying time by 40  with better results  dryer itself works good  however i am already wrapping duct tape around the twist mechanism that allows the stand to go up and down    its cracked  first day of use  i should send it back but i need the dryer now works very nice on both voltages doesn t get hot enough bought this for my wife and and she recently took it on a trip and loved it  powerful enough  not too noisy  takes up little space  it does exactly what you want from a travel dryer  it is good drying tool  i expected it to be a bit better from reading reviews  br   it does the job as drying hair and it is good quality and well made hair dryer  br   i recommend  excellent choice  love it      highly recommend it   this hair dryer is wonderful  fantastic bonnet drier  definitely worth paying a little extra to get a quality product  i primarily use this when i am doing a deep treatment on my hair  love the small size   dries my hair very quickly and comes with a great travel bag   it does such a good job that i forget that it is travel size  i love this one  great purchase  it drys my hair super fast  i love this hair dryer   the power it delivers is perfect and it seems to dry my hair in half the time of my old one  the speed and heat buttons are  user friendly  and the heavy cord is nice and long  altho it s not quite as light as i d imagined and maybe even a little bigger than my old one  i wouldn t consider it to be heavy or bulky and it s still quiet and powerful   good value for the money  great dryer  i use it to deep conditioner my hair   i love the portability of this product   this is a lot better than the bulky hooded dryer  love this dryer   it is my second one  but wish it lasted longer  first one was less than 2 yrs this was delivered well within the promised window even though we were in the middle of one of the worst weather weeks this winter so far   when i used the dryer i was even more pleased because my hair felt sooooo soft and was so shiny  even my hubby thought my hair felt softer   you ladies are doing great work and i thank amazon for carrying your line of products  excellent product and it is exactly as described by the seller  it doesnt damage the hair like the other dryers ive tried and its very lightweight does the job right i ve been very happy with this so far   it s very light  and i love that it has three heat  one being no heat  settings and two speed settings  which is more than most dryers have   the airflow is pretty strong on the high setting   the setting labels are already wearing off though  after only a few months of regular use  i already had this hairdryer so it was just a replacement still love it wow    incredibly fast shipping from mix wholesale  i ordered it on thursday  it arrived on saturday  and i live in georgia   put it together in less than 20 minutes and powered it up  so easy to assemble   can t wait to use this on my 4b c natural hair   will update again after more use  br    br   update  this dryer is fantastic   dried my freshly washed  dense  chin length 4b c hair in about 40 minutes  on medium heat   i did not need neck covers or ear protectors at all  i have a pic of the size rollers i used  they fit with ample space under the hood  it s also very quiet  i had no trouble having a conversation on my phone  easily watched television  i haven t had to duct tape anything  it s pretty sturdy  a little wobbly  but not i m not moving around a lot if i m sitting under the dryer anyway   br    br   basically  i love it and i m so glad i didn t waste my money on a pibb or pebco brand  i don t own a salon  but it s great for home use and is a million times better than standing in front of my mirror trying to dry my hair with a handheld blowdryer  works great  mounts nice  best blowdryer  love it  recommended by my hair stylist and its amazing  great used this for my aunts salon  cheap but works like its an expensive dyer i love this hair dryer   it is so easy to use   and i really like that the cord is extra long to reach an outlet in another room   does a great job on my hair which has become dryer due to aging   great for all seniors   this is a very nice  professional looking hairdryer  nice color and the design is very sleek and sharp looking  looks like it s worth a lot more than what it really cost  it comes in a nice box  so it s very suitable for gifting the description says it s   34 ultra lightweight  34  but  for me  it felt like it weighed just as much as any other hairdryer  i like that it has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings  i have very fine hair  so how much heat i use on my hair makes a big difference  the hottest setting does seem to get very hot  so be careful  also with my fine hair  the higher settings had a tendency to tangle my fine hair  so i had to usually use the medium heat setting  which worked well  the hairdryer itself was not loud and dried my hair quickly  it has a long cord and comes with a concentrator nozzle which really help to reduce frizz  the concentrator nozzle is very easy to remove and put back on when needed  i also like that this hairdryer had a removable filter  it was easy to twist off for cleaning  overall  it s powerful and does a nice job  i loved the look and it s easy to hold and use  hoping it will last awhile  would definitely recommend  br    br   disclosure  i was not financially compensated for this post  the opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product  i received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion  this product had great reviews  so i thought i d give it a try  turns out it s the best blowdryer  it s lightweight and dries in a very short amount of time  i cannot express how much i love this hair dryer  it s small and sleek  it gives me the hair i want to have  that look that i was always jealous of others having  i no longer look like a big frizz ball  i didn t know that hair could look this good  and i m thankful for the opportunity to test this product complimentary and give my experiences and feedback  i love all the features of this hair dryer  the cooling feature is by far the best feature along with the nozzles  i use to let my hair air dry and it took so long to dry being my hair is so long  this hair dryer took about 10 15 minutes  i didn t get tangled hair that hurt brushing out like i did with other hair dryers  this is the best dryer  i can see why other reviewers found the parts to be flimsy and plastic   it could very easily break and be unrepairable   but the heat is steady and well distributed   the cooler setting does not burn my scalp and the hotter setting is great for a quick blast to get drying started on my long hair   i will say to be very careful with the plastic parts and it should be fine  good job good hair dryer works well my old  revlon  hair dryer went kaput  and i went to a local store and bought another revlon to replace it   yikes   while it did dry my very straight  fine hair quickly  the air flow was so strong that when i put my hair in velcro curlers  the revlon hair dryer blew the curlers out of my hair   so i went looking on my beloved amazon to find a better hair dryer with lots of positive reviews  and ended up ordering this for about the same price i paid for the revlon one   this one is great  so much more substantial and quality feeling and noticeably quieter and less shrill sounding than the revlon  br    br   my single complaint is that the toggle switches on the handle that control the air flow and heat settings are a little too easy to accidentally change when drying your hair   but i still like this hair dryer a lot  good product all well great hair dryer   have been using them for years   nice wall hung means out of the way not laying on the counter or having to unplug and put away each time it is used   my last one lasted about 5 years   bought two more   wind is strong and does not feel too hot  get hairs dry quickly  love this product  love this   i dropped my previous one  different brand  and had to replace it   the cord keeper part is the main feature for me   the hair dryer itself works fine  a little louder than most but is also more lightweight than most   love it  it drys my hair  does what it s supposed to  pretty much says it all  if it s alive a few years from now i ll be impressed great    good i love how lightweight  fast and very quiet this hairdryer is  the reason i dropped it to four stars is because it has a tendency to tangle my fine  not thin  hair  but the pros definitely outweigh the one con  fine haired women just need to be careful about pointing the dryer down the hair shaft to keep the tangles at bay  this is the best hair dryer   it is my second one   i had the first one for years and when it finally broke  i tried a few other blow dryers but returned them all and went right back to the conair 1875   the cord keeper is a great feature for me  since i keep the dyer in a drawer   it stays in there compactly  use it every time i wash my hair  pretty good  it s been a while  works without problem  it s good  just what i wanted  this was installed in a rv on the wall of the bathroom area  the unit is plugged into a 110 volt gfci outlet and the night light and unit power can be turned on off by pressing the gfci button  the night light is good   not too bright but ample  the unit appears to offer good air flow and not being too noisy  i am happy with the performance  looks and operation so far  great for my natural hair  has proven to be sturdy   saves me a lot of time in the washing process  love it  does a good  hot enough  diffuser is a bonus  good quality  very pretty  powerful  only complaint is its kinda heavy so after a while it kinda hurts my hand  but i guess it s not really a problem since it dries my hair pretty quick  i love it amazing product works great for naturally curly hair  it really does what it says    it effectively smoothes hair and significantly helps reduce frizz  i have used other hair dryers from xtava  and this one is by far my favorite  the other one was great for quickly drying my hair  but it left my ends feeling really dried out  this one takes a little longer to dry my hair  but it leaves my hair feeling so soft and not damaged at all  br    br   this dryer is very easy and pretty straight forward to use  there are three heat settings on the heat switch  three speed settings on the speed switch  and a cool shot air button  on the heat switch you will find low  medium  and high temperatures  on the speed switch you will find off  gentle  and strong  the cool shot button is used to set your style  i like to use this dryer on him heat and strong speed  i use a round brush to style my hair  then the cool shot to set  br    br   the dryer comes with two attachments  a concentrated and a diffuser  the diffuser is great for those with curly hair who want to reduce frizz  the connector is great for people who have straight hair  it really helps me style my hair straighter  without needing a straightener  br    br   i really like how hight weight this dryer is  i have been having some weird back shoulder problems over the last couple years  so the lightweight hair dryer is something that i can really appreciate  i have small hands and i think that this is very easy to hold  br    br   the hair dryer is quite and while it might not have the power you are used to  it works great  i like that my hair appears to be far less damaged with this dryer than any other i have used  and it only takes a couple more minutes to dry  that is a tradeoff i am more than willing to make  this is the dryer i will continue to use on a day to day basis  like others  i did receive this to review  what i have written is honest  i would not mislead consumers as i would not want to be mislead  this is a product that i stand by  this hair dryer is top quality and i love it  dries my hair quickly  is light weight and works great  has many adjustments for speed and heat plus cold blast  best dryer i have ever owned so far  love it  has 3 settings and cool  warm and hot for drying hair  works very nice  and low  med and high also  this is a fabulous hair dryer   it comes in a nice box and a nice color blue   it is so light weight which makes it easy to dry my long hair   normally it takes a while to dry my hair but with this hair dryer it probably cut the time in half   it has a nice diffuser along with 3 heat settings   i like to start out on high  then a curling brush and low heat and finally cool to set my hair   i love the cool shot to set it too   my hair has less frizzies and looks a lot healthier since using this hair dryer   i am so glad i got to try it complimentary  for a honest and unbiased opinion  excellent power with easy to use temperature change contol  love it  love it  arrived soooo fast made me very happy       and the dryer it self is fantastic  this is a nice hair dryer i really like the color to it  it looks fabulous  the hair dryer it self is light weight  i like to use it without the attachment because usually it works faster than with it but that is just because i have long hair that has tangling issues  the hair dryer gets hot enough to dry your hair fast and it will look great  it has a nice long cord to it that doesn t get tangled up either  i received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product  love it  recieved it quickly  dries really fast  only down side is that it vibrates leaving my hand tingly  but its awesome  i ve only been using this dryer for a week but like it  it is powerful and does a nice job  i m not sure how long it is going to last however  but for the price  i m pleased  the only con is the weight  it s pretty heavy but it works perfectly  works as expected   love the zebra print zipper pouch it comes with   arrived quickly and price was very competetive   keeping it in my suitcase for travelling as it is small   small but quite powerful  decent heat temperature and air flows   a good hair dryer for the price   lighter weight than the last silver model i had   that one lasted for nearly 10 years with every other daily use  i have owned one of these dryers in the past  and found it like many others   in a hotel bathroom  great dryer  very affordable  i accidentally broke mine dropping it down an entire flight of stairs  just replaced even cheaper than i purchased it for 5 years ago  best hair dryer  very happy excellent  i am so glad i bought this  great quality and dried my whole head of hair in minutes which is wonderful after i allow myself a few more minutes of sleep in the morning  a really good and worthwhile purchase  just want to say i am still thrilled with this purchase of about 6 months ago  it dries my hair incredibly fast but also gives it body that lasts for a couple of days  i could not be happier with this product  i ve been around for a   34 while  34  and no other hair dry has ever come close  jump out of the shower  blow dry my hair for a very short time  and i m on my way  love it    great hair dryer  nicely balanced  good air flow  and not too loud  this is one appliance i hate having to replace  as you get so accustomed to one  but this one is if anything an improvement over my old favorite  dual heat   speed controls are a must for me  nice inclusion of the extra drying attachments  do not buy this    im a professional salon owner and i bought this  something inside broke off and every time it is turnes on it makes this excruciating click clank cling sound that hurts your ears while under the dryer plus the loud sound of the dryer  i have to use it on the lowest settings which takes hours upon hours just to dry   i used this dryer 3 times before the problem started  exactly as described i never ever write reviews for products  but with this i had to   it s that amazing  my hair is very thick  and blowdrying my hair with this dryer is faster and easier than i ever could have imagined  you know that amazing feeling you get when you ve just gone to a salon  that s what your hair is like every time you use this dryer  100  worth the money  good heat good dryer  lightweight   works well  2 speeds  very good blow dryer  i usually buy very cheap ones but splurged a little this time  love it  it is a little heavier than i m used to  excellent in every way   i really like this  br   my favorite by far good product i couldn t find good for my hair any  only this one i use about 2 3 years already  and still have it as a gift for my mom  br   highly recommended item  very nice  exactly like photo  delivered fast  great price  i am very happy with this product  it dries fast  it seems like a very sturdy product  not like some of the low end products out there  this is salon quality   i have had this hair dryer for a week and i love it  i can dry my hair in under 10mins  the attachment allows you to put the dryer on your hair which speeds up the drying time  i have thin but long hair and i m amazed at how quickly it dries my hair  it s a good hair dryer the attachment just won t stay on    good power works great arrived on time  just like my old one   i love it  i love this  great  great product love this hair dryer  so glad i got it  also  i live what the company stands for  best blow dryer ever   you can feel the quality as soon as you pick it up   performance none better   worth every penny  i love this hair dryer   it is quieter than my older conair   it has nice speed temperature settings that blow dry quickly without as much damage  i can dry my below shoulder length hair with the medium heat air setting in less than 10 minutes  my hair is soft and easy to style  plus attachments stay on tight  i will buy remington from now on  this hairdryer is perfect for thick hair  the handle feels comfortable while in use and the nozzle has vent holes  so you can get real close to your scalp and the air deflects through the holes  great design  i just replaced my old conair hair dryer  i like the 1875 models  as they are usually more powerful and work more quickly  i do not recommend this model  however  although it is an 1875 power  it works like one of the smaller  less powerful models  and this one is terribly  terribly loud  i m actually concerned that i might suffer hearing loss if i were to use this on a daily basis  i ll be returning this one  dries my hair fast and isn t very loud  absolutely love it  thank you so much  good  perfect replaced old one i was very pleased with  hair dryer works great when i first turned this product on my hair was wet  when i turned this device off my hair was dry  br    br   i purchased this because i was looking for the cheapest product available  it worked perfectly and does appear to be a quality product  i have been very happy so far  this dryer is   34 ok  34  i was hoping for something a little more powerful than what i already had  it gets the job done but no quicker than my other blow dryer   in fact i feel like it takes my hair a bit longer to try   and it is heavy  after reading the great reviews  i guess i was hoping for something more than it actually was  which is a regular   34 ok  34  hair dryer  it s missing a screw to put this together     besides that     i received it on time  it s the right size  and the price was excellent        quiet and quick  my old hairdryer was a screamer and i got this one because i was developing tinnitus and everything i read suggested controlling decibels was important   the buttons are right where you grip the handle  so it takes a little getting used to placing fingers so you re not changing your settings   my hair is smoother  i was very satisfy with my order and it was delievery on time as promise  excellent excelllent 10 stars good seller  i received the product on time and without problems  i recommend for all  perfect for my needs  works good   doesn t seem to have the output force on low speed that my previous hairdryer had  wattage is the same    seems to get the warmest heat it needs to be on high   i prefer a low speed with high heat  i love the hair dryer by conair  my last one was a conair  it lasted many years  i spent a very long time waiting for the right deal on an ionic hair dryer and this was the first time in at least 6 months that i saw what i was looking for with an appealing price tag  i took the plunge and bought it and have been very happy with the results  my hair turns out very smooth and is even shiny after i use it  the clip on accessory is amazing for focusing the air stream and definitely helps with minimizing frizz  it is also very pretty     everything is working well  no problems after a month  happy with everything  awesome product   i would recommend it to anyone good while it lasted   i used it  at best  5 times before it just stopped working  love this hair dryer   had an older one for years  it finally died so i replaced it with this newer version  this is a great hair dryer and is a lot lighter than the clunky old one i used to have  it looks great and helps my morning routine go a lot faster  i am able to dry my hair quickly and i love the attachment that it comes with to be able to focus all the hot air on one section of hair at a time as i am brushing it out  when i use the attachment it makes my hair look a lot better as well than without using it  this is a powerful hair dryer it isn t the most powerful hair dryer i have ever seen but definitely a very good one  it is very powerful and dries my hair quickly which is awesome since i have really long hair  it is a nice sleek hair dryer so it fits nicely into my hair dryer holder and looks really nice as well  i received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product  great little hairdryer   especially for travel  the best hair dryer ever  works great and light to handle this dryer dries my hair quickly  leaving it smooth and shiny   and my hair requires less touching up on the second day  this is a very sleek and stylish hair dryer  it looks very nice  it   powerful at 2200 watts  this hair dryer comes with a concentrator nozzle but no diffuser  however  a previous diffuser that i owned fit on this just fine  it has a nice long cord too  the only thing is the cord is really thick so it easily knocks stuff down if anything gets in its way  i was very excited to get an opportunity to receive this for testing and inspection purposes  it works very well and dries my hair quickly  i like the more powerful hair blowers because they dry hair much faster than lower wattage dryers do  this one comes in black and looks very stylish  the concentrator works well too but you do need to push hard to get it on the hair dryer  it has three temperatures  hot  warm  and cold  or room temperature but it always feels cold to me   it also has two speeds  low and high  in addition  it comes with a cool shot button  which gives you a blast of cold air when you push the button  the button is easy to push but it s also black so it blends into the hair dryer  i would have liked it if the cool shot button was a different color  other than that though  i really like this hair dryer  it s powerful and efficient at drying my hair  this review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product  i have been impressed with each xtava product i have tried and this hair dryer is no different  this dryer is powerful enough to dry my hair completely in a short amount of time  i like the attachments  especially the diffuser  i m also quite fond of the bright blue color  product provided to facilitate this review  but all opinions are honest and my own  the first thing i noticed about the hair dryer was the sturdy sleek cord which felt well made and strong  the cord is long enough to plug into the wall and be able to use it 6ft away from the outlet  the hair dryer comes with the concentrator nozzle which i would have died without but it doesn   bring the diffuser nozzle which i found kind of odd since most companies include both nozzles  anyway  so i plugged in the hair dryer and started to blow dry my hair using the same brush i always use  i tested out the different heat settings and was impressed with how quickly the temperatures change  if you switch from hot to cold it happens instantly meanwhile i  e owned hair dryers that take at least 20 30 seconds just to make the temperature change  the two different speed settings are your standard low and high  yet  at the high speed the noise the drier makes is not loud at all  the dryer isn   completely soundless but it isn   obnoxiously loud compared to others i  e owned  i found that when i used this hair dryer my styling time was 20 30 minutes quicker than usual  in addition  my hair felt really smooth afterwards and the end result wasn   as frizzy as i expected considering i have curly hair and i m not a professional at blow drying   update  after using the hairdryer for a few months  i noticed that whenever i would use this dryer my scalp would become very oily right after blow drying  whenever i use my old revlon hair dryer my scalp remains dry and i have never had this issue before  i haven t changed any other hair care or hair tool besides this dryer so this must be the culprit   i did receive this complimentary for review purposes but this does not influence my opinion  great hair dryer   fast and hot   good quality product  how did this product get so many 5 star reviews  br   the product is good and the idea of a wall mounted dryer is excellent  the product fails in my view because the three tiny  mollies  supplied to hold it to the wall are pathetically under engineered  the dryer will just pull off the wall after a couple of times  br   a better way to mount is to drill a second hole in the mounting plate and to screw it to a wall stud with long screws  br   another good product hijacked by under engineered chinese manufacture  nice dryer  just as expected  okay  i have fine hair so my hair doesn t take that long to dry     i can have my hair dry styled in about 3 minutes with this powerful blow dryer and that is on the medium heat   great dryer with a nice leopard pattern  great hairdryer el producto es muy bueno br   the product is very good great dryer  really like how there is a constant cool setting that doesn t have to be pressed the whole time  the different heat setting are nice as well  and the cord keeper  oh my gosh   totally radical   no more wrapping the cord around the dryer for me  i hope  i absolutely love this hair dryer  i not only use it on my hair but i use it with my crafting  this dryer is amazing  multiple heat options as well as blowing speed  plus another button for cold air  great dryer  very powerful  works really well  only thing is control switches are where your fingers go so fingers push switches and changes settings while blow drying  very good article  i have 4c natural hair and i use the large comb to make the blow dry  wonderful  i m in love br   i leave in france and the article was well packed my hair is thick and long   it dries frizzy without blowing it dry   i do not get  the chance to go to the salon much   the attachments on this dryer make me feel like i am doing something for myself without devoting more time   i love the color blue and black   i loved the opportunity to use this dryer   in exchange for i am also providing my honest and unbiased opinion   the drying time on my hair was cut down by a few minutes   i have a three year old daughter that will not be still for anything  i used it on hers for just a minute on low cool   it was perfect   not too strong but enough to help knock out the wetness   i prefer the high warm on mine   i do not need to further damage my hair   which means cutting out the drying time is preserving my hair some   without the attachments this hair  dryer should travel easily   the cord is not too heavy and should roll up easily  excellent product  powerful and light weight  i love it    i have thick  long hair and this was recommended by my hair stylist  it is very powerful and dries my hair more quickly than anything i have bought before   i would highly recommend this  love it  bought for my son and he loves it and uses it every day   not too loud which is great  i have thick long hair that takes what it seems like hours to dry  so i had to see if this hair dryer  was as great as it says  and it is  my hair drying time got cut more than half of what it usually is  and my hair doesn t feel frizzy like it does most of the time  i never tried a iconic hair dryer before but i heard good things about it  so i am excited to have this one  and it s big but it is also light weighed  which makes it perfect  it comes with two attachments and i tell you when i tried both of them out  it felt good on my scalp  it was like a light massage  i am proudly leaving my honest opinion about this product that i have received  works better than expected i got this for the wife  but have to say it s not noticeably lighter than the previous unit we had but it is very sharp looking  the controls are all conveniently placed with a plenty of speed and heat settings  the cord is of very good quality and pretty lengthy  i feel for the price it s a very good buy and would really recommend it  i received this hair dryer as a sample for review and evaluation and i have found it to be working well  it comes in a nice box that is very suitable for gifting   the pros on this dryer for me are that it is lightweight  has a long cord  is sleek and not bulky  and comes with a concentration too  the con for me  someone that has long  thin  fine hair  is that it tends to be hot even on the lower settings  sometimes this is a pro but overall for my hair type it is a bit too hot for the total drying process so my hair tends to be more tangled at the end  all things considered i still think it s a great dryer and i realize not everyone has my hair type  i absolutely love this hair dryer  my old hair dryer would take me 20 mins to dry my hair and now i can dry my hair in 5 mins  after 12 years  my old  exactly the same  dryer died   it didn t owe me a thing   i was pleased to find the same design still available   we have a small bathroom so i don t have the space to leave a dryer on a counter  and i m certainly not going to take one out each morning and put it away after use   this is so darn convenient  love it but it s so small  can t wear rollers with it unless your willing to put in the time to stretch out the cap and pull your hair  great dryer     love the diffuser that comes with it   not too expensive and it s lightweight and compact   very highly recommend when i first received this product i was a little sketchy  as hair dryers normally make my hair super frizzy  br   this hair dryer is amazing  the diffuser works just as it should  my normally frizzy hair was smooth and flyaway free  which is attributed to the ionic technology  br   this dryer has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings  as well as a cool button  which is always good after a long time of use on your scalp  br   its very lightweight and easy to use  even a beginner  like myself  can get use out of this product  br   it has a nice cool blue tone on the front  which is good for me  br   all in all i d say this product is the best hair dryer i have used to date  would highly recommend to anyone  this conair works so much better than most blow dryers   it is a great color and had a great output   i was so very impressed with how much quality you get for the price   the reason i am giving it 4 stars is because it is a little heavier  not cheap plastic at all  whoa   amazing what a difference this hair dryer makes   ive owned many  none that compare to this   no more uncontrollable or fly away hair    its like magic   the best ive owned     nothing fancy  works well for the price  good value for money  good nice price nice product no complaints works great   i have thick hair and it dries really quickly with this hair dryer  it doesn t feel cheap and i like how the top is long enough that my hair  i have mid length hair  doesn t get sucked into the back of it where the fan is  buttons are easy to work with  better than those you have slide up and down  this is the best hair dryer i ve ever owned   it has so many settings you could never burn your hair unless you don t know what you re doing  which seems impossible   i can dry my hair in half the time it s so strong   that s the biggest deal for me   plus  it has 3 settings for how strong to blow dry  3 settings for how hot and cool  plus the cool button   definitely spend the money on this  it s worth it   i love my dryer  love it wish it had a comb for naturals but it s worth it   great blow out everytime delivery was on time  i they are so easy and light to handle  just what i was looking for  br   thanks so much   love it  heavy and durable hair dryer super hot and really nice to use   serves its purpose  what more could i ask   i love this dryer because it is so gentle with only two settings  the band on the bonnet is tight at first  but after weekly or biweekly use it gets a bit more comfortable  i cover my ears with wrapp it bands when drying  the carrying case is convenient and everything fits perfectly inside even after several uses  kind of weak  not quite powerful or hot enough for my liking  this was a replacement for the same unit we d had for years   just a simple snap in installation   great product at a great price  love this hairdryer  i ve had maybe 5 or 6 of them  mostly they only die when i drop them on the floor  i love the fact that the new one fits the wall mount from the last one and i didn t have to make new holes in my wallpaper  it s a great little hairdryer and not expensive  purchased because i needed a hair dryer  but didn t want to spend a lot of money  i like it  if you want something that gets the job done and doesn t cost a fortune  it s a great option for you  i ve used it several times now and i ve had no issues  convenient and classy wall mount hair dryer  no fumbling under the sink or closet  available when i want it  good  basic dryer  liking it a lot  great hair dryer i usually dread having to blow dry my hair as it is very long and pretty thick  so it would often take an hour or more to get it almost all the way dry  because of the time it takes to blow dry  and the fact i am semi lazy  i have had the same motel type dryer for about 15 years  yikes  and been hesitant to buy a new one figuring they would all take forever to dry the mop on my head  when i was offered the xtava  allure 2200w hair dryer to review for an unbiased opinion i was pretty excited  br    br   this hairdryer is a decent size  yet very lightweight  it has 2 heat settings as well as the option for a cool blast here and there  there is also a detachable piece to put on it for when you want to dry your hair section by section to straighten it  br    br   after trying this the first time  i now want to use it every time i wash my hair  it is super easy to handle  which is awesome if you re all over the place flipping your hair around like i do  one of my favorite parts was that the back vent didn t try to eat my hair  my old one would suck it in if you got it within an inch of that vent  i am tendered headed  it hurt   all of my hair was dry  no slightly damp spots at all within 20 minutes  i highly recommend this particular hair dryer for those with long thick like hair  yes ladies and gents  it is possible to have lots of hair and not hog up the bathroom for hours on end  this dryer is amazing i have 3c 4a hair and it dried and straightened my hair in mins wow  love it  i have been using this brand and dryer for 10 years now   they last a long time and makes my job as a stylist satisfying   its gets the job done great for keratin treatments too high heat is very high   like the dryer   this is the second one i have bought  works great  wife happy somewhat better than others its size  though still blows very hot   almost to hot on the low setting   but is useful for travel i couldn t live without it  excellent seller  good product  was exactly what i ordered  arrived on schedule with no problems and works perfectly  thanks daughter is very satisfied  dryer does everything she expected  and a great price  best blowdryer i ve owned  i ve had it for 3 years and still works as good as new  i absolutely love this dryer  i was a bit apprehensive at first because of the price tag but it s well worth the money  i have curly  color treated hair and i definitely noticed the difference using this hair dryer verses my old one  my hair feels healthy  smoother   as if i just came back from the salon  great product  best hairdryer on the market  not too loud and dries hair fast  i should have bought 2 cut my drying time in half   love it    i love this hairdryer  so lightweight and my hair is great   it really does make a difference to have a great hairdryer  better than expected  what can you say about a hairdryer  it dries my hair nicely lol  it doesn t get as hot as i expected  like my last one did  but it s a nice hairdryer for the price  all excellent  recommended 100  perfect  just what i wanted  fast delivery  great dryer  it s fast and it was a great buy  used this at a hotel and had to have it   best hair dryer i ever used  a great lightweight product  easily stored on a shelf   i bought it to heat process my hair color  and it does the trick  very good product  love it  5 stars great product  works great   no complaints   fyi  i m 28   never owned a hair dryer before so i dont have anything to compare it to   btw if you think it this product sucks  it doesn t  it blows  straight out of the box this is the best blow dryer i have ever used   it is really light weight and easy to handle   there are 3 settings and 2 temps with a cool blast for setting your hair   i  have long thick frizzy hair that some days i would love to cut all off   my other hair dryer  never got rid of any of the frizziness   big plus also is the diffuser  attachment that is included   what a difference  with the 1800 watts my hair is dry in 1 2 the time and is smoother than i could have every imagined   this is definitely a salon grade product at a great price   i did receive at a special deal and love the fact that i was able to test such a wonderful product  nice hair dryer i am very impressed with this allure professional hairdryer  br    br   upon arrival it was packaged in a nice black matte box  with stylish decoration and writing  hair dryer was wrapped in a plastic covering  and has a black shiny finish and matte finish  br   this hair dryer is super quiet and performs very well  very lightweight  br   there are 3 heat settings  and  2 fan settings  as well as a cool burst button  br   the cord is very long and heavy duty  which makes it nice to not be limited in cord length  br   it has an angled end for air that fits over the end of the blow dryer  br    br   the blow dryer works very fast  my daughter s hair usually takes about 8 10 mins to dry and that dry time has been cut in half  she is very impressed with this hair dryer  br   i love the tourmaline ionic ceramic blow dryer  it is very gentle on your hair  br    br   i m very glad i was chosen to test and review this hairdryer from xtava  it works really well  item was the exact item as seem on the pictures  came with all three extra pieces for blowing out the hair  use it recently n it was good      i must say its very hot   good tool  its just to see how long it will last  but no regrets in this purchase n i m loving my dryer cord is way too short   i can t hold it over my head when standing in my usual spot   also  it s not hot enough   the hottest setting is more warm than hot   it is lighter and quieter than most  but i still regret buying it   i did not tried the attachments   they went into the trash along with the box  seems great at first  but it s not great for long hair unless your unnaturally careful while using it  it s always a possibility that long hair can get sucked into the back end of a hair dryer  but because of the extremely small size  it happens extremely easily with this one  especially if you flip your head upside down to dry it  you lose even more control  the first time it sucked some hair up  it lost significant drying force  the second time  it stopped working altogether  not to mention the hair loss  it is  however  without a doubt  the most adorable hair dryer i ve ever seen  love it  i love this hair dryer   it is very quiet but strong   it puts out an amazing amount of heat   the only negative thing i can say is that the buttons are right where my fingers are and sometimes i shut it off  the powers is not as great as previous dryers i have owned  i bought it because it was pink   pretty  wish i hadn t now  great appliance for the price  my old and expensive blowdryer that i received as a birthday present still ran but slowly  hence  my new replacement  would have been happy for an orange one but sadly amazon sent me a yucky fuchsia dryer  at least  it works great and has more options than i thought  great for someone always on the go  normally i would have rated this item as very high  however of the 3 hair dryers purchased  one was defective  while the hair dyer aspect worked  the green light  bottom left side  did not  this defect was not apparent until the hair dryer was installed  i understood this to be a good hair dryer  but a defection like this does not look good  i will be thinking twice about any future purchases of this hair dryer  regarding product quality  as i can t afford to have a defective unit installed  i had to give my customer a 40  discount because of this  not good  thank you  david have used this dryer in hotels and when my old dryer died  i purchased this one   have had it a few months now and absolutely love it   it is the only dryer i have used that has both a low and a high fan volume on the cool setting in addition to the heat settings  it s mounted in the guest bathroom and everyone who has stayed with us have commented how great it is and how nice it looks  i got this for my mother  her old one is going bad  she was so happy when i got it for her birthday  she s very happy with the product  thank you i am one of those lucky people who can achieve poker straight hair or curly hair just by the styling tool i use on the end of the blow dryer   when i was given the opportunity to test this ionic hair dryer for quality  i was super excited   there were many things i liked about this blow dryer  br    br   1   i like the shape of the unit   i was able to hold the dryer by both the shaft and the handle depending on my needs to get the best angle for all my hair  br    br   2   it took about 1 3 less time to dry my hair than with my other blow dryer even though that one has more watts   i m not sure if it was due to the less drying time of the fact that this is an ionic dryer that my hair was less frizzy   it s winter here in indiana and i generally have to use argon oil on my hair after drying to tame the frizzies   i did not have to use the oil after using this blow dryer  br    br   3   it s extremely light weight and quieter than my previous dryer  br    br   4   it came with both a diffuser and a concentration nozzle   i use the diffuser when i want curly hair and the nozzle when i want to go straight and sleek  br    br   one thing i did notice is a burning smell the first time i used the unit   by the time i finished drying my hair though  the smell was gone   overall  i am very impressed with the quality and results of this rimini xtava  this is nice      great dryer    i just wish the cord wen further up into the retractable handle  very good i love this hair dryer  it comes with two attachments which help keep the heat damage to hair at a minimum  the design is aesthetically pleasing and easy to use  it heats evenly and does a fantastic job  it is high quality for a great price  i recommend this product  great purchase   amazing bought for my girlfriend and she proclaims its the best she has ever owned  just okay  amazing  okay product i like the xtava hair dryer  it work good and i don t have any problem with it   this hair dryer has two speeds and 3 heat settings that is good so you can control how much heat you need  this dryer comes with attachment to help dry your hear directly on the spot that you need and not making the rest of your hair frizzy  for my straight thick hear the dryer works very good and i was sent this for review  however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions  love the product great service love this hairdryer so much i have an extra one in my guest bathroom  wooooooooooow        this baby dries hair in a blink of an eye   i am a cosmetologist and blowouts   blowdries are my salons main ingredient this thing save me 10 15 minutes   in a salon  this means more clients and more money    i told a colleague of mine and now we are ordering more   hopefully this product can be as good as the first day for a while     ps  i just placed a second order for 2 more  this is a great hairdryer  very pleased  even if it is a slight pink  great blow dryer   does a wonderful job  will not buy another brand  this is a great unit  compact put full of power   i wish this was the standard unit used by hotels   highly recommended  the dryer looks good and works  i ordered this because a friend s recommendation  honestly  i feel it is a bit overly expensive  i was hoping my hair would be smooth and shiny after use but the outcome was not that great  plus  there is no english manual  only japanese one  a bit frustrated  loud like most hair dryers  i like the temperature setting and retractable cord  air flow very good  i purchased this unit when the more expensive hair dryer i had purchased from staples online had a bonnet that would not have fit the head of a tiny baby    let alone an adult with curlers in her hair  br     this dryer is very lightweight and doesn t put out very hot air but it is sufficient to dry your hair  just takes a little longer  and the price was great  xtava rimini iconic hair dryer is 1800 w  which is perfect for extremely good results for styling and drying your hair with in short period of time it helps ur hair hair from getting frizzier and more dry looking by different speed for air blow and two power buttons  also contains two attachments which can be used for focussed precise area u need to style or dry  without affecting the remaining part of the hair after using the second attachment i am surprised to see the difference in my hair as it looks more shinier and don t forget to use the cool feature after you done drying your hair it gives such a finished look to the hair keeping it more natural and free flowing i have tried other xtava products too like allure and i must say xtava  products have proffessional results got excellent motor  safe to be used by urself and economical in price with all the required features  i will definetly recommend this without any hesitation i did my research before buying a new hairdryer and this one fits the bill without having to spend  1 200   it works well excellent the quality of this dryer is outstanding  i will save alot of money and time doing my hair with this equipment without the need of the salons   a    i love this blow dryer  it is so much more powerful than the one i have been using and gets my hair dry in half the time  the box says 80  of the time but i swear it seems faster than that   i can t believe i have been wasting time drying my hair when there have been products on the market like this that will get it done so much faster  until now i didn t realize there was a difference but i swear there is  when i use this blow dryer my hair seems more voluminous than when i use my old one  this is also very lightweight and sleek  not to mention the fact that it is quiet  i couldn t believe how quiet it was  if you are looking for a professional blow dryer i would highly recommend this one  this product was provided to me for testing and quality evaluation  second one of this week  works great  fast shipping and undamaged  this hairdryer is light yet powerful   my first one lasted over 15 years  i m hoping this one lasts as long or longer  i absolutely love this hair dryer  it s super cute  sleek and looks professional  it has a lot of functions and it drys my hair fast  fast dryer  a lil nosey but is good for drying   recommend it to anyone looking for a portable hair dryer exactly as expected  good value  very powerful  and with 3 heat settings  and two speed settings  this has everything the pro s want      a very well made product that is built to last     i give it the highest rating  this works very well   it s my second conair  and i think i will enjoy using it  powerful and adjustable very good works welll nice product     works great i really needed a new dryer and i m glad i picked this one  it has great power and i like the folding handle  works great  my wife is very happy   i absolutely love this hair dryer  i did a lot of research as to what people where saying was the best hair dryer nowdays and it consistenly showed this one  i love the high pressure and the different settings  my hair is silky and definitely not frizzy by the end of a hair drying session     works great  abundant heat  quieter than its predecessor  i got them on time  so credits to amazon prime for being fantastic  br   unfortunately  the product was defective and didn t work at all  the material used is very cheap  flimsy plastic and the weight of it is disturbingly light  i do not recommend this product even for people who rarely use their hair dryers  this hairdryer is great  i bought it because we recently moved and i couldn t find my hairdryer in the sea of boxes    i ve had mine a long time so it was also a good excuse to get a new one   i have fine thin hair  this hairdryer not only dries my hair very quickly but it gives it a lot of volume that i really need  i m very happy with my purchase  i realize now how lousy my old dryer is  the collapsible handle  the stow away cord  the power of the motor  all these features make this hair dryer really great  price was right  too   highly recommend  substantial and stylish  works well  very happy and really impressed with my new xtava iconic hair dryer  i have curly hair that is difficult to straighten and that is ok  with this hair dryer and the diffuser i am able to achieve beautiful curly hair that is soft and bouncy with no frizzies  i love how it has different setting from no heat to hot and low air to a lot  so i have the options i need and want for achieving any hair style i want  today i decided i wanted my hair to look sleeker and was totally able to do so with the directed tool and a round brush  i have loved giving you all my review and opinions in exchange of complementary product  first of all  this blow dryer is extremely light   surprisingly light even  if you have long hair  or a lot of it   that is something you will surely appreciate   it also has a very powerful motor so that you can get the job done in no time at all   if you are like me at all you need to get your hair dry as fast as possible in the morning so you can get on with your day   and not  frizzy  dry as many blow dryers are good at accomplishing    but sleek and sexy dry   the diffuser nozzle of this product makes that possible for me   it stays on securely while drying my hair and diffuses the air just enough that my hair no longer  frizzies  up  br    br   some tips on using the diffuser  br   1  apply your choice of hair products br   2  allow your hair to dry 75  before using the diffuser  if you are in a rush  use regular blow dryer first without nozzle  br   3  use clips if you want to add volume at the crown of your head br   4  if you have time  use the cool setting to dry your hair with the diffuser   if not enough time  use medium to ensure your hair will not frizz br    br   i am truly honored that i was offered the opportunity to review this product at no cost to me   every once in a while you just know you have a winner on your hands  and this is such a product   stylish  effective  fun and extremely light  br    br   highly recommended  br    br    product received free or at a discount in exchange for my review so far so good  powerful  does make my thin hair look more volumn  works great  sometimes cord re winder does not rewind all the way which can be a little frustrating  i had a model similar that lasted many years so when it died i bought this and it works the same and has the same issues with the cord winder  however i still like it very much as it does blow alot of air which is why bought it again  this midsize but powerful dryer is a game changer  i love it  i have layered  waist length hair that becomes a frizz mess if not blow dried properly  the volare v2 dries my hair smooth and silky  i ve been using sedu 6000 which blows too strong and gets really hot surges that smokes my hair  v2 has the perfect combination of heat and airflow  and the cool temp actually blows cool air  my hair dries and styles faster with the v2 than the sedu  made in italy  four year warranty  my search for the perfect dryer is over  works great i ve had this hair dryer for 3 years now and it works great  i m very surprised by reading some negative reviews  i have never had any problems with my hair dryer  my hair is very fine so it gets the job done in 5 minutes  my only complaint is that it s a little loud for me cause i have a baby that takes naps all the time  other than that it s a great basic hair dryer nothing fancy  although i did buy mine at walmart cause it was cheaper really great product for the money  this is a fine hair dryer    i am sorry it is so large however as i have a tender shoulder     that makes it hard to use at times    the dryer however is a good one  my mom wanted a small and powerful hair dryer and when she opened this on christmas day she was quite excited  by far the best hair dryer i ve used and for the price is definitely worth getting one of these bad boys   make sure to clean the back every now and then just place against your vacuum hose to get excess hair and debris  my all time favorite dryer  it came without instructions   works okay   nothing above average about it  very happy miss the cool shot feature of my cheaper dryer  don t feel like it gets as hot either  great service  very nice blow dryer  the dryer is great  great temperature control too and very quiet  this is very important since i live in an apartment   my only complaint is that the timer should also be quiet  it is constantly ticking  it s not loud but you notice  when in use so you hear it especially when you re in the dryer  when the dryer is finished it   34 dings  34  that it s done and it can startle you if you are not expecting it  i just have to get used to the ticking timer but in general i am very happy with the dryer  this is a great  powerful and affordable hair dryer  it really shortened dry time significantly  i purchased one for my daughter  but ended up getting 2 more for me and my mom  we all love it  description stated this product was powerful and had the cool shot option  it does not have a cool shot option  and is far from powerful  my daughter and i are fighting over this hairdryer  we both tired it out and love it  br   it is black  not a silver color as in the picture  very sleek in design  it is lightweight to handle with a thick black cord  i knew this was going to be a powerful dryer as soon as i took it out of the box  br   it is listed as 2200w and it does not disappoint  my daughter has thinner  straight hair  it took us minutes to dry her hair on a medium heat setting  the high heat setting is very hot  we did not use it  br   i have thick  coarse  curly hair  a few minutes on medium heat and a low air setting and i was good to go  br   we were given the opportunity to test and try this dryer  based on our experience and our different hair styles  we both love this dryer and stand behind it based on its quality and construction  br   we love the design and the heat  air flow settings  this is a powerful   well designed dryer that will last for a long time  so far this hair dryer is great  last year i purchased a conair one similar to this  and it seemed to over heat easily  i like the fact that this one has a low medium  and high setting  the attachments that came with it are pretty good  i know a lot of people were complaining about the brush being too soft   and i can see why they say that  fortunately my hair isn t that thick  so the soft brush works fine for me  it works really well   best thing i have bought so far  i am very picky with my hair  i ve only used hair dryers  100  so buying this one was a huge risk for me  i have very long  straight hair that without any heat comes out wavy and sometimes frizzy  this hair dryer is quieter than my old one and definitely dries my hair pretty fast  my only problem with it is that the attachment falls off occasionally and the cord is insanely short  great dryer for my hair   felt drying time faster love it   small hands and it is very good and lasts a long time  good i have never used a hair dryer that could dry my long hair in under 30 minutes until i tried this one     this works amazingly and i love the way this hair dryer looks   so sleek looking   i would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for an affordable  well working hair dryer    best blowdryer hair will be dry in record time  only wish the concentration nozzle was permanently attached  for the price  you can t beat it  simple to use   no adjustments beyond   34  low   off   high  what more can a person want  do not get hot enough and a little smaller than what i thought  i noticed less static in my hair after the first time of using  i also notice more body if i use moose  it is a little heavier than a normal hair dryer but i have no problem putting up with that if it makes my hair look better  i also thought the price was great compared to other dryers of its likeness  love the temperature   does not blow too hot  getting use to the button locations  this is a great dryer for my curly frizzy long hair  makes it smoothe good love it  love it it dries my hair beautifully awesome four stars    might upgrade this to 5 in the next month or so   this is a good little unit  perfect for travel or light use   the first one overheated after 3 5 minutes of use  i was able to exchange it with the vendor  and the replacement unit seems to work perfectly   once its used a few more times  i ll either upgrade the rating or comment below   not a bad dryer overall  and it comes with 2 attachments   a pokey thing  and a duck bill thing  i like it  but it doesn t really sound like a normal hair dryer  it sounds more like a vacuum  so far  so good   much better than my previous hot tools that blew up   it is heavier  but dries my hair faster and with less tangles  not as strong as i would like it to be i have a vacation rental close to a nationally known hike bike trail and many of my guests are here for recreational activity   in 3 years  i ve only had to replace one of these units and everybody seems to love them  brush is a bit soft  but good product wife likes very much  been in use 3 months still going strong  favorite dryer ever  even though i just got this week  i used on both my daughters hair to blow out for the first time    i bought this because i remembered my former stylist using this tool on my hair years ago   i saw the price and jumped on it   it s not fancy but it has four settings from cool to high heat and if you know how to use a blow dryer properly then you should be fine   thanks amazon for having st half the price as walmart      worked like s charm on my girls and i only used cool and warm heat     they have lots of curly hair  comes in handy 4 travel or a quick fix it  so i tested my new allure 2200w hair dryer and so far i really like it  it dries my long hair in no time and and it doesn t leave my hair frizzy  it is lightweigth and it looks nice  the chrome looking lint trap at the back can be twisted easily and pulled out for cleaning  it looks nice but be very careful because  correct me if i am wrong   it is made out of a plastic material that seems like it will easily break  i am going to use and keep this hair dryer in the bedroom vanity just incase i drop it  it will fall on the carpet floor  the extra attachment that came with it is also nice  i also have a 1875w conair infinity that i have been using for years  i love it but i compared the two today and they seem to blow about the same amount of air  if allure is blowing harder  i cannot really tell  the small button to press cool air is a bit hard to press but truth is  i never use the cool air function anyway so it dont really matter for me  over all  i will start using this allure from now on and will give him hubby the conair one  the other minor things does not hindrance the funtionality of this hair dryer so if you are planning to buy this  go ahead  give it a try  i think you will like it too  will be perfect for greece   just change setting to 220 250 and plug in to adapter  great hair dryer   in addition to its useful purpose  i like the retracting cord so that when the dryer is put into a drawer  the cord is not getting into everything else in the drawer  it is very nice   motor sounds are not cheep dryer at all  it is very powerful  especially my long hair    br    i am so satisfied with this item  br   but only i don t think i need that it call skin  make moisture to your face   dial  i don t think it working noticed in the us  because japan are more humidity country but not in the us  i love this hairdryer  it dries my hair in well over half the time my old one did  the removable back allows you to clean all the lent and stuff that gets in there over time  it s perfect  and it comes with a ton of attachments  i am so in love with this hairdryer  my hairdryer gave out recently so i was on the hunt for a new one  i purchased one in the store for double this price and i was not satisfied with it  it left my hair frizzy  one of my favorite things about this hairdryer is the slanted handle  it fits perfectly in my hand and it s just the right angle to dry my hair without twisting my hand  another great thing about this hair is that it really does dry your faster  i am really amazed by how fast it dries your hair and does not leave you with a frizzy head  i can actually use the high speed and not make a mess of my hair  i love the 3 temperatures  most hairdryers offer heat with the option of the cold button that you have to hold down  this hairdryer not only has the cold press button  but also high heat  low heat  and cool  so you don t have to hold down the cold button because the cool button is cold enough  i like to start out on high heat all over then i divide my hair and use low heat  after drying is complete  i like to set my hair with the cool option  the concentrator nozzle is just the right size  you can also remove the screen on the back of the hairdryer for easy cleaning  this is an amazing hairdryer  i love that i got the opportunity to test this hairdryer in exchange for my honest  unbiased opinion  i would definitely recommend this hairdryer  it is the best hair dryer  i purchased this for a professional hair stylist with ten years experience   this is the best dryer she s used thus far   the price was amazing  less than half of what i almost paid locally   drying hair with this is much like aiming your head at a turbine engine with very high velocity constant airflow and heat  it dries hair in about 1 3 the time of others she s used   i m very satisfied with this purchase  i am very happy with my new dryer from xtava   my previous ones were revlon  both the same model    the first one got pitched because the cord was becoming severed from the dryer   the second because it started making a horrible noise and sparked at me   as long as this new one doesn t do that  i will be happy   i hope it lasts a long time   it s a cute design  i have the blue flower  it is a very good item   very easy  to switch on   perfect  not as strong as i expected i had to have a hair dryer so i could dry my silky terrier s long fine hair after her bath  i needed a dryer that was lightweight because several years ago i hurt my hand and it s hard for me to hold a heavy hair dryer for very long  this is perfect  it s very lightweight  small and easy for me to hold  i love this hair dryer and don t mind using it  as it doesn t hurt my hand at all  love it  now my hair looks like i just left the salon  quick dry time and great sheen absolutely in love with my new xtava professional ionic ceramic hair dryer  i really got the results i was looking for  as i am reviewing for free  after washing and conditioning i towel dried my hair and combed out  i then proceeded to use my round brush to blow out my hair and it worked out very nicely  i really like just how well built it is  looks and feels very durable and high quality  i also love the settings as well  hot high heat down to low cool air  it s perfect  i highly recommend for anyone who is looking to achieve ultra stylish do s to those just looking to dry their hair in the morning  this xtava hair dryer will not disappoint  i am so happy to have had this opportunity to present my review to you out there  i used this dryer while at a renaissance suites and loved it  when i returned home  i looked it up online and ordered it  i m just as pleased with it as i was with the one at renaissance suites because it is lightweight  quiet  and efficient  sturdy  a bit bulky   gets incredibly hot  so if buying for salon use be careful when using with bleach on high heat  it gets very hot  nice i love this hair dryer  this is by far the best hair dryer i have ever used  first i would like to say that alot of hair tools claim to be professional but aren t really  but this hair dryer gives the look  feel and performance of a professional tool  it comes nicely packaged in a sturdy box and the dryer itself has a great looking sleek design  it has a thick long cord  it dries hair so much faster than what i have used in the past and i love that it offers different speeds and heat settings i also really like the concentrator nozzle to use to focus on certain areas  overall i am really impressed with this hair dryer and would definitely recommend it  i am so glad i was given the opportunity to try out this product at no charge and share my opinions about it  is holding up well  i enjoy that the warm is enough to dry thick hair best hair drier i have ever owned  wife loves it and says its one of the better dryers that she has used   for how inexpensive this hair dryer was  i was a little worried about the  quality  but  this is a great hair dryer   it is quality made  and actually the best hair dryer i have ever had  it dries the hair quickly without getting too hot  or too cold   it is just right  didn t like the buttons  i ve returned it  i m giving 3 stars not 1 because i used to have conair hair dryer and it was quite good  great price  dries hair fast  great for winter days  lots of speed and heat options  only the bilious orange color might be an issue  great dryer      this blow dryer is awesome  it uses tourmaline ionic technology for drying  which i was looking for  it dries my hair with less damage compare to other form dryers  rimini 1500w tourmaline ionic ceramic professional hair dryer is inexpensive  it comes with concentration nozzle and customized diffuser  it is lightweight and the quality worth higher end hair dryers  it has cold shot button  3 level heat button  and high and low power settings  i am pleasantly surprised by how good it works  it dryers my hair in half the time as my old dryer and my hair is so smooth and soft  no more frizzies  this product was provided for review by by xtava  i bought this hair dryer because i wanted a cooler setting for drying my hair without holding down a cool setting and trying to manipulate the dryer on my hair  this dryer does an amazing job in drying my hair without the damage that hot air does to my hair  cool air actually makes hair appear shiny and closes the follicles making the hair seem healthier  super fast hair drying time without the frizz   so much better than the dept store options for the same price or even more   very happy i bought this hairdryer    twice    for the retractable cord   on the  first one i received the cord didn tretract at all so i returned it and asked for a replacement  i  figured it was a fluke  replacement was only slightly better  cord retraction was rough and sporactic  so i returned for a refund  amazon arranged for the free return and pickup of both hair dryers  so i may have unhappy with the purchases but the return process was a very good experience  it is just a defective design   my husband picked up one at target and the retractable cord didn t work on it either  great item   lightweight   very effective at drying the hair   highly recommend    videoid e5ff7a1f6cf2306e1ed10662c3a2720f  my hair is so thick it used to take me almost 30 minutes to dry it even with the use of a hair dryer  until i used this professional ionic hair dryer  i love the precision the concentrator nozzle provides  allowing me to focus the heat exactly where i need it the most  this allows my hair to dry much faster since all the air is going directly where the hair is still wet  the nozzle is easy to attach just by pushing it on the hair dryer when it is powered off  br    br   the hair dryer has  2  speed settings and  3  heat settings  so if my niece wanted to use this she could  she has really thin hair so she doesn t need a high setting  or much heat    i love the cold shot button  i use a big round brush to give a little curl on my bangs  i hold the brush in place  use the heat to give a shine and volume to my bangs and then i do a cold shot for a minute to lock in the look  sometimes adding a little hair spray before i use the cold shot  it works perfectly  br    br   i love the hook being attached to the hair dryer so i can hang it up when i am not using it  less clutter on my bathroom sink  this hair dryer is well made and absolutely my favorite one i have ever used  the cord is thick and sturdy which is great because it will not break as easily  i was provided a sample for evaluation and review  good  compact hairdryer   looks nice and works well   i have short hair so set it on the lower volume   also  hardwired it to an outlet   what i do not like about it is the night light   it s too bright   i think i am going to disable it  great hair dryer  light weight   easy to hold  my one complaint is that the diffuser was quite difficult to attach   the instructions did not mention how to attach it  i had to read other reviewer comments for advice  this is a great little hair dryer   i  have chin length hair and it was perfect   there is a lot of air coming out   it comes with a little carry case  and several min attachments  very light weight   it only has a high and a low setting   so there is no real temp control  it is a good feel in my hand  and i suffer from carpel tunnel syndrome  i can hold it with a solid grip  the one reason it is not five stars for me is the cord  although the angle of it looks like a good idea  it can sometimes get in my way when i am trying to work with a round brush on the back of my head  however   i am very satisfied with my purchase  because the heat options  air flow settings  weight  sound  and looks are all attractive and smooth  it has not smoked  over heated  or gotten too heavy while i have been using it  i can have it on and my boyfriend can still sleep in the bed  with a closed door as the only seperation between us  arguably  he is a heavy sleeper  overall  i am happy and plan to use my complimentary discount code on another product from this friendly company  works wonderful and fast  but the cold press button got unglued  powerful great for gym  dries quickly exact replacement for what my wife has used for years works well and is very portable  power and great tangle proof retractable cord  there s a lot of low reviews for this hair dryer and most are because it s loud  yes  it is loud  i don t use a hair dryer to style my hair i just want it to dry it as quickly as possible  i have long hair to my lower back  its  mostly  straight and very fine hair  i part my hair in the middle  then turn it on to the highest speend and hot  i dry my left side in 5 mins then my right side  another 5 mins  this is the 3rd time i ve bought this hair drier  the 1st one died when i dropped it  r i p  the second one just died after 5 years    it wouldn t heat up  5 years for  20   that s a good deal to me  if you re looking for a fancy hair dryer to carfeully and  apparently  silently    continue looking  if you re looking for a hair dryer that will dry your hear in 10 15 mins  if you have thick hair  then this one could be it  wife loves it  great bank for the buck  had to switch it to the higher setting for my wife s needs  but it s working ok  we ll see in the future  as some reviews question it s durability  very happy so far  i haven t owned this very long but it seems to work very well  it has a lot of settings so i can always find what i need for my hair  great product  can t beat that price  worked ok for a little while  then the power and heat went out  best  most powerful blow dryer ever  works good light weight and small and great power   very pleased with this little dryer   bought it for travel but may end up using for every day  1 year and still works great   excellent buy i love this allure professional ionic ceramic hair dryer by xtava    when i received this hair dryer in the mail i was so excited to test it out as my old hair dryer just crapped out the other day and i ve been without a hair dryer  i m in love with the design   quality of this hair dryer i love the sleek black design    this hair dryer is also made of high quality materials which is a plus for me as it needs to be able to last a long time  its pretty light it weight compared to my old dryer with i love so it won t made my wrist tired since i have long hair that normally takes a long time to dry i need to be able to have a dryer that light enough to hold for a long time  this dryer includes a concentrator nozzle with i love and works amazingly   this attachment is said to direct maximized condensed air flow to the area you are targeting  adding precision and focus while controlling frizz and style outcome which it definitely does   it also seems to dry my hair a lot faster then my old dry with saves me time    it also has a 2 speed settings and 3 heat setting which  work wonders and are a great feature to have    i am really impressed with this dryer   i definitely would recommend this hair dryer by xtava   brand to everyone    i was so excited to receive this hair dryer from the company to test and share my opinion   great blow dryer  works great   i purchased this for my teenage daughter  she absolutely loves it   way too loud  cord keeper is a nice touch but returned it to prevent hearing loss  going back to using a hair band for the cord  a great hairdryer  it seems to get my hair dryer faster than ones i ve used in the past  the color is pretty too  this blow dryer works great   it never frizzes my hair and the temperature control settings are really nice  it is not too heavy and i can easily dry my long hair without getting a workout  i also really enjoy the color  awesome product  this dryer replaced our old one  which finally gave up the ghost   it is powerful and easy to control with the dual thumb controlled switch which regulates heat and fan speed  i always come back to this model of hairdryer   i ve had a couple of these hair dryers over the years and i love them   they last a long time  they are lightweight  the buttons are easy to use along with the cold shot button and they dry my hair quickly   i ve tried other hair dryers from conair and returned them because they just didn t perform as well for styling my hair while blow drying   the last model i tried was the conair infinity pro which is twice the price of this model   the nozzle without the attachments was too narrow so i couldn t style my hair well plus it was very heavy   i returned that one the same day and went back to this model because it has always worked well for me   i won t stray again   i actually purchased three of these since i noticed that now their is a new model of this hair dryer   i would really miss this one if they discontinued it   since these last a long time  i should be set for hair dryers now       it s a great performing hairdryer and the price is perfect  they get very hot  love them  very pleased  funky wild color and works great on my curls  this hairdryer worked ok for me but did not last too long   it runs very hot on the high setting  i sometimes worried it might explode because it was soooooo hot   therefore  i mostly used the 2 lower settings   one day  it quit altogether   the one good thing about it  it was quieter than any other hairdryer i ve ever owned  this is the best hair dryer i have used in a long time  it s lightweight  easy to handle  and not bulky at all  it also is high powered and dries my hair is less time than the dryer i was previously using  as someone with thick hair that is used to spending tons of time just drying my hair  this is a huge plus  the black color of the dryer is also sleek  and i like that it comes with the concentrator attachment  product provided to facilitate this review  but all opinions are honest and my own  good very strong and powerful hair dryer  a little bit heavy  but i don t mind  was purchased to use oversees  compact and light  works super fast and does the job  ok love this  i have 4c hair with a tendency to shrink almost 75   this gets the job done  i also use this on my three daughters  hair  we all have 4a 4c with high shrinkage  and this is one tough dryer  the attachments hold on for dear life and still have not broken  love the fact that it really is hands free  but it is quite a monstrosity  it took me awhile to find the correct height that i wanted it and the right bend  so i feel like i have to leave it up  thank goodness it s not in my way too much  but it certainly is an eyesore  very nice  lightweight  seems to dry hair quickly without frying it  so far very nice  but time will tell how long it will last  great value so far  i am completely satisfied  i have a long  strong  thick hair  and it works for me as good as  the proffessional blowers i used to have  i just hope it last  i like it very much  good price  very light  even the colors of this hair blower are nice and they delivered on time  thanks  one of the best dryer for this price range  i like cold wave  very satisfied  works great for frizz control  i agree with the other comments  i love how compact it is but was very disappointed with how heavy it is  it arrived in the original package but looked used  the dryer was just thrown in there without additional packaging  it also has a strong burning smell when drying that maybe wears away with more use  lastly  do not buy if you are a lefty  just holding it i was able to switch the settings while drying my hair   a vey nice hair dryer  compact  folds   and has great power  this is my second one  i purchased it to leave at the beach condo  this is a really wonderful blow dryer  it seriously cut the time it takes to dry my hair in half  it was really lightweight and has a very sleek design  it comes with a removeable nozzle that centralizes  the heat that i really like  i am happy to recieve xtava s awesome blow dryer to review  i m throwing the old one out for this  this is truly the best blow dryer for naturally curly headed gals    powerful yet gently on my curls and easy to use   love this product   light weight and very good heat control very happy w this ourchase my hairdryer is so old i think it has lost all its power so i stopped using it   i saw a great promotion for this item and figured it was high time i got a new one   as soon as it arrived this morning i jumped in the shower to wash my hair and used it and oh em geeeee it is great   i have really curly hair  spiral curls in the back and looser curls up top  and the air director thingy  that is a technical term   is so great   i don t like to use  a lot of product in my hair but hate frizz  this seemed to seal the deal without having to use so much product my hair felt crunchy   today i have soft  bouncy  frizz free curls     now i need a new camera so i can show them off  works great  i ve been using this for about a week now  i previously had a revlon with retractable cord that still worked  but it was really hot  i have oily hair  so i have to wash it pretty much daily  the heat was killing my long hair  i took a chance on this and i am really glad i did  initially  i was disappointed  but i am glad i stuck with it  br    br   1  power  it has almost too much power for someone with long hair  my hair was flying all over the place  it also tangles easily   i added one of the 3 concentration nozzles and that really helped  br    br   2  heat  yes  its not super hot    but heat isn t good either  it does start off rather cool  but it always heats up more about 30 60 seconds into blow drying  with as much power going through it  i don t think you need as much heat to accomplish getting dry hair  br    br   3  buttons  yes  the buttons are on the side  i think the reason most people complain about button placement is because they are so used to the position of their old hairdryers  it takes some time to get used to a new one  i think people notice the difference a lot at first  but it really will go away and you ll get used to it  it hasn t been an issue for me  br    br   overall  i am pleased with this blow dryer  i can t say that my hair dries any faster than my previous dryer  but it will be much healthier in the long run and that s something i appreciate more than speed  it definitely does not take a long time by any means though  i am happy i got it  great product for coarse hair  i have a 4b texture and when i use the high setting with the fine tooth comb attachment  i get my hair very straight  the only reason why it doesn t get a full 5 stars is because of the placement of the cool button  if the button was a setting instead of at the back  the blow drier would be perfect  totally diggin my hair dryer   gift from hubby   needed something quiet that didn t wake up the kids   2 levels of speed  low works as well as high  just more quiet   2 heat levels  ions can be on off  cool blast button  small  light  love    great product  fast shipping  works great  ok this took about 10  minutes off the drying time of my hair as opposed to  using just a regular ionic hair dryer  but not ony that it leaves my hair  which isa bit past  shoulder legnth color treated grey hair with some slight curl  smooth and un frizzy   i could actually dry it and wear it with out hot curlers or a flat iron  though i still prefer to use a flat iron for extra shine  i never believed that one hair dryer was much better than another but this one sure is  it is an investment in me and i am so glad i bought it  very good   it s a great hair dryer  light  fairly quiet  excellent very responsible very powerful blowdryer but doesn t fry my hair fits my hair dryer perfect  love it  fast shipping  a           fast shipping  awesome blowdryer  very loud and have burning smell  from the first use you know it will die soon  my curly hair  somewhat thick  used to take at least 30 min to dry  sectioning off and drying with a round brush   after that it would take me another 15 min to straighten and smooth it to get frizz out  this dryer dries my hair straight without having to section it off  i don t even have to flat iron it afterwards     it is smooth  straight  and frizz less in under 10 min   amazing   will never buy any other dryer   i bought it 3 months back  no problem at all  serves well  quickly dries my hair  i mostly use it in medium speed  it s a light weight dryer  it is easy to use present for my mom and it s very good quality for price  i m so excited when i receive this item  and can t wait to try it  the product was shipped from japan and took about 20 days to be delivered  i have always loved the andis hairdryer but paid thirty some dollars for this and it only lasted couple months the switch quit working and the dryer would get so hot would shut off before could get my hair dry nice hair dryer for everyday   travel  br   has on going problems with the retractable cord  this is amazing   dries my hair very fast and it s so shiny when i m done   the only negative is that it s pretty heavy  but i ll just chalk that up to an arm workout      very lightweight  so great for long uses  light weight yet dries hair fast has a 110 or 220 setting so it s perfect for worldwide travel  works with a plug adapter  no converter needed  nice and compact  it s a bit noisy  but i think that s a function of its size  the cord and plug are not as large as some  so it s footprint is small  which is exactly what i was looking for to travel to the uk  it s not lighter than my larger one but it will work just fine  this is great product  easy install  these work great for motor homes and any close bathroom location  love it so far  no complaints that i ve come across very good dryer  nice power  not as heavy as the reviews i read previously  great blow dryer for my getting my wavy hair smooth  when you brake your arm or can t use your  arm hand and you only have one good hand  this is the best choice out there for you  love the convenience of having it on the wall and it works great   it s the second one i ve owned and i would buy an oster again  excellent this dryer dries well   the bonnet is small where it fits around the head  placing a snall towel near the brow makes it more comfortable  also restringing it so it fits an adult head   the bonnet smells like plastic for several uses  but now smells better after i took it out and let it sit without being folded up in the case   good compact drying with great drying power  used in italy and was great high wattage drys hair very fast this dryer is amazing    used it for the first time today  leaves hair very soft and no frizz  it is a little heavier than a normal hair dryer  but i love it    for an inexpensive hairdryer it fills my needs  i use it when i travel  i would love for it to be br   a bit smaller and lighter  but that may not be possible considering the existing features  perfect  works very well  just got it about 3 months ago and have been traveling with it with a converter and it is still working well and doesn t leave my hair too frizzy  absolutely loved it   until it quit working   after six weeks the   34 low  34  setting was just a slight puff of wind   the   34 high  34  setting then had as much power as the low setting had previously when it was working properly   at the same time  the   34 hot  34  setting became so incredibly hot that the coils inside glowed bright orange   so i started using the   34 warm  34  setting   it s now completely worthless  it works and makes her happy  5 stars  this a good hairdryer  i use it as my everyday dryer  it is a bit heavy for packing if weight is an issue  amazing  gets hot and works perfectly  the price is right and this product will get plenty of usage  i m in love        i am very pleased with this product and the price  br    br   i bought it so i could give my hair hot oil treatments and it has been great  heat distributes throughout cap and it s easy to use and store  third time is a charm   i was looking to replace my hair dryer and the last two i tried were so loud   this one is great  yay  works excellent i bought this to use when travelling because of it s compact size  but it works so well i ve been using it everyday   the cord stores easily inside the  handle and the temperature is perfect    not too hot and not too cool  i added the attachment and found it performs better with it on  has great power and doesn t make my hair frizzy or staticy  the only complaint i have is the strong plastic smell when i first opened the box  i ve used it for a week now and i don t smell it anymore  i really do love this hairdryer  love it  new to hair dryers but does everything it should and a bit more  works great  looks cool i have owned a couple of these hairdryers   they work great for 3 4 years before they get noisy   for the cost and the convenience it can not be beat  mi friend loved it this dryer by far is the best ever     i have really long hair extensions and they take forever to dry  and after reading the reviews for this dryer i decided to try it because they say drying in half the time  br   they weren t kidding  this dryer is amazing to say the least  i have never owned such a great product that is so inexpensive  so do yourself a favor  purchase this dryer  you wont be sorry  it is truly the best  even on cool or medium speed this thing is magnificent  some of the reviews comment on this dryer being heavy  i ll share a secret   cheap dryers are superlight weight  but in all sincerity  this dryer is not heavy at all  so not sure why some reviews say this  the button placement was an issue when i read the reviews but decided to try it for myself  and what i personally found was  where i place my hand is at the bottom anyways  so it was a non issue for me  it s totally worth trying because everyone is going to hold their dryer in a different spot anyways  and if i didn t purchase this based on what others said about weight and button placement  i would have missed out on the best dryer ever  and believe me  i have tried them all  and side note  it really does dry in half the time  which means an extra 20 mins in the morning hitting the snooze button     works good   i researched a lot of hair dryers  wanting one that wasn t too noisy and that had both temperature and fan settings   found it   this is the one   it wasn t as expensive as some that just seemed like more than i needed  it does the job i need it to  in a short amount of time  w o frying my hair   it s not the large size so it fits easily in my suitcase and travels well  i love the matte finish  which keeps it from sliding off the counter   just feels solid in my hand without being heavy  even  fast drying favorite dryer   dries hair quickly  works great  absolutely love it  it s a great hair dryer  i love it  great blow dryers  i really loved this blow dryer however   i have only had it for about 5 months and it has just stopped working  i didn t use it everyday either  i used this blow dryer while in spain   it worked wonderful  i loved this blow dryer      but mine just died  i had it for almost 4 years  so it was probably worth the price  but   i think i d rather get a new one that lasts longer  can dry hair faster than the other of the same voltage i ever used   a good compact hair dryer  i use this to travel internationally  so far just denmark and spain  and it worked fine with the european adapter  just make sure to flip the little voltage switch before you use it   mounted well   looks and works great  love this quiet  efficient dryer   the plug broke after one month   now i have to fiddle with the plug in the outlet to get it to come on  then it keeps turning off   an electrician checked the electrical circuit  which is ok  it is definitely the plug on the hair dryer   if i move it around in the outlet  the hair dryer will turn on and off and on     it was a christmas present i bought it early december  so now the return policy just ran out  missed it by a few days   br    br   do not buy this hair dryer      cheap piece of junk  i love my light weight hair blower    it is quick and easy and my hair comes out so soft and not frizzy  br   it has two heat settings  i start out with the high one for a couple of minutes and then switch to the low br   and it still dries nicely but does not stress my hair  i have very fine hair and lots of it so it is not easy to br   dry  oh  and my hair is long  this dryer is keeping my hair so nice people ask me how i make my hair br   look like it belongs on a 30 year old  i m 65  this wonderful blower has a lot to do with it   this hair dryer is amazing  i just ordered another one for my daughter  she has super thick long hair and doesn t like to dry her hair because it takes too long  we just tested this hair dryer and literally her hair was dry within 10 minutes  great product  great so far    it has great power and heat  great travel hair dryer nice retractable cord love this dryer   for the two levels of intensity no matter what heat level  i liked working fine very light and has strong power night light was too bright and can not be turned off or down nice   quiet works great  even with traveling a lot it still isn t too bulky  we ll see how long it lasts but does the trick  the product is great  exceeded my expectations  thanks  will purchase brand again i admit  i was skeptical about whether or not this dryer would really make a difference in how my hair felt but it did   i have noticed that if i use a br   higher speed than is recommended for my hair type  it doesn t make as much of a change but if i follow the proper instructions  my hair is soft br   and shiny and the results are incredible  great  works great and keeps the vanity uncluttered  very powerful  excellent  excellent  it s very easy to put together  it s not too loud actually i m watching jeopardy while under the dryer right now  the bell is not too loud when the timer is done  the only annoying thing is you hear the timer ticking but i m used to that from going to the beauty salon it goes unnoticeable  delivery was quick and swiftly and customer service was excellent  my hair dried very quick and i didn t even put it on the max heat  i m african american with shoulder length hair 4c and i never had a perm  i m glad i purchased this dryer because it is an reasonable price it shoots sparks fairly often  kind of scary  solid  albeit heavy  great if you have shorter hair  but i imagine the weight would be kind of a pain if you had more to deal with  my wife loves it  though  it s hard to find a good retractable cord dryer  quiet and efficient  br   nice wall mount  i bought this dryer for my 7 year old as her first hair dryer   it s very small and lightweight so she can easily hold it   she enjoys being able to dry her own hair  i love the hair dryer but the comb attachment starting breaking on our first use  i put these in rv s because they fit in a tight spot and work well   glynnsrv com this hair dryer is quiet  powerful and hot  looks good  easy to handle  very happy  perfect for my 6 yr old daughter  fits her hands perfect  mini and mighty  she uses the low setting  the high setting is very powerful  great item   would recommend    this is by far my favorite dryer  i love the built in cord retractor  especially for traveling  which we do often  i have so many gadgets i need to bring  my suitcase is always a mess of cords  in addition to that  it dries my hair so fast  i have fairly thick hair  though it s thinned over the years a bit  and it would take me in upwards of 20 minutes to dry my hair with a standard dryer  using this dryer with a ceramic brush has my hair dry in under 10 minutes every time  the cool shot option is great for just adding a bit of curl around a brush if you re in a hurry  too  my hair tends to get a bit curly as it dries  so i really like the diffuser attachment as well  it works perfectly to smooth out my hair without it poofing out like crazy  i still like to follow up with my straightener because it makes my hair really shine and glow  but the diffuser makes the job much easier  i ve been using tourmaline ceramic dryers for years and i have much less breakage and a huge reduction in split ends since making the switch  so at this price  this dryer styler is a must have  item received in great condition  bought for wife   must be good  she takes it in all the trips this is a good hairdryer for travel and okay for every day it s not the best driver i ve ever used but it does the trick  good price very pleased have had this for almost 3 years now without any problems   that s impressive for hai dryers and hair straighteners anymore i wanted to like this blow dryer more because of the reviews on it  but there just aren t enough heat settings on it  and it gets really hot  too hot  but the combs are sturdy  and it s serves it s purpose when i decide to use it  i switch up with my vidal sassoon dryer  when i need something with more alternatives to heat settings  simple blow dryer with cool function love this dryer  well worth the money    so glad i finally bought it      not for a short nozzle dryer  it pops right off  but it s a good bowl and finger design of medium depth  excellent hairdryer  my wife loves it  very good quality   i love it  the hair dryer does well with my thick hair  good in the hand  the cord is a bit forceful  at times i have to pull it out again to get it to retract fully but this could be attributed to independent factors  angle of handle when activating cord keeper    fantastic for saving space  best i have ever purchased    love it does not turn on   very dissapointed have had it for 4 years and still going strong      great hair dryer      updated review  4 months after installing this blowdryer  it died  i was super disappointed given my glowing review below  i have not even contacted amazon or the manufacturer since it s past the 30 days  the wire below the handle started to heat up a little bit  i smelled smoke  at first thought it was my hair  but  the thing died shortly after  i have another blow dryer  not sure if i received a lemon or if this is andis quality  my past blowdryers from other reputable firms would last 7 10 years  4 months was a huge let down  previous review below   definite space saver  quiet  does the job  i feel the low setting is definitely very low  much lower than my travel blow dryer you can find at any drugstore  however  i like the higher setting  it s nice to wash  blowdry and head out  makes my mornings much easier to have things in place and organized  this blow dryer comes with two long screws  you have to remove the baby screws on the plate on the back  i then marked the walls where the two holes are  the plastic anchors i did not use  because the frame holder is super light weight  so is the dryer  it s nice  in addition  the green light makes a nice nightlight in the bathroom  personally  i wish i could change the color to clear or blue  the photo they provide shows the cord hook is on the right side  there are two other sm med size screws to hang the cord to either the left or right side  i prefer the right side  however it all depends on where you place it in your bathroom  it s a great product  they thought of almost everything on this dryer  the only two things i would change is to have even a more minimized holder  semi translucent   optional colored dryers  retractable cord  small dryer  more powerful  cool air option dryer  i e  fan with a hold button      no cord but a chargeable blow dryer  i think that s about it  i read some bad reviews on this hair dryer but so far i have not had any problems with it  i actually love it  cute colors and drys well i hardly ever write reviews  but this thing is fantastic  i was amazed when i blow dryer my hair and it was actually softer  the price may seem steep  but it s definitely worth it  love  great so far  so good   i have found that these hair dryers do not last  so    34 time will tell  34   br   works good  no complaints  works great works great  but is a bit louder than i expected  low power  but with patience it does a beautiful job good just loudd don t know the longevity of this item yet  but it s a must have for travel  on the euro setting  low is high enough  i have lots of fine  curly medium length hair and it dried in less than 10 minutes  yes  it s loud but worth it as a space saver and effective dryer  my girlfriend loved this dryer   except for the fact that the motor died after a year   super annoyed wonderful product   purchased due to shoulder injury and now post surgery   i can blow dry hair while device securely holds blow dryer and can safely move it in any direction  i love the sleek design  and color of this hair dryer for starters  but i had one i loved more  so  i gave this one to my mom  the ionic technology really plays a role in hair dryers  helping maintain  a healthy  beautiful shine   no frizz  or elongated drying times here   three settings are perfect for drying  the shot of cool hair is wonderful as well  or you can hold it down to dry your hair with cool hair  perfect for setting curls   this hair dryer is quitter than most  but its still a hair dryer  so its going to be noisy   i really like it  the swivel cord makes it easier  so your not getting tangled in your own cord   product received for reviewing purposes  super light and easy to handle   dries fast and isn t too loud   a      great  small  light and does exactly what i need  who could ask for more  i initially liked this dryer but it is heavy and all the teeth in my comb broke  now i cannot find a replacement comb  if anyone knows where i can get one  i would appreciate it this a very light blow dryer unlike others that i have owned  i love the way that it curves ensuring that the heat is going directly where it needs to go  i have a lot of hair and so does my daughter and its a hassle trying to get it done but i can honestly say that out hair dries in less than ten minutes   im highly impressed and cant wait to try out more products from this company and let us not forget the color of this dryer    its blue and i love it   packaging is lovely as well easy installation  and the wife loves it  so in my book that s worth 5 stars  great little hair dryer  very lightweight  dual voltage for overseas travel  and  a long cord  great hair dryer my wife loves it   she says it s as good as her expensive high end model that it replaced and weighs less  i got this to replace an ancient hairdryer that just wasn t working well anymore   this is a wonderful hairdryer   i can dry my hair quickly and it has all the possible settings that i ll ever need   i am totally happy with this  okay great product   i broke down and got this dryer to take with me while traveling   i loved my other conair hair dryer so decided to find something that could pack in a suitcase   this hair dryer puts out a ton of heat for such a small product   i love it   it is perfect for the traveler as well as someone who appreciates a great product  i have very thick  very curly hair that typically takes a long time to dry  the little mini hair driers that you find in most hotels these days just won t do the job for me and none of them have a diffuser or will fit a travel diffuser attachment  which us curly girls require   but with this hair drier  i found the answer    it has great air power  2 heat settings  and dual voltage so you can take it on overseas trips as well  barely adds any weight to your luggage  so important these days now that airlines charge a hefty fee for non carry on luggage or baggage that exceeds their weight limit  and the handle folds up for compact packing  the diffuser attachment works quite well    maybe not quite as effective as my full size diffuser with my full size drier  but pretty darned good  it s great for travel and will have your tresses looking gorgeous in no time  highly recommended  wife says this is the best drier that she has owned to date  loves it best little travel dryer ever   very powerful  very compact  lasts forever  does not produce static  i m on my 3rd one  not because the previous two were faulty  but because i lost one and the other finally wore out  i only wish they made them in more colors  buy this and you won t regret it  absolutely love this hairdryer   it is compact and convenient but does not sacrifice any power   i have really thick  wavy hair and this travel dryer is the best i have found   i now have multiple  love the dryer because it is small    wish the price were not quite so high  not sure what features might be missing to make this hair dryer sell at such a low price  it does everything i need it to  plus has two attachments i ve never used  pinpointer and curler   the  cool  button actually gets cool pretty quick and feels a little cooler than the ambient temp  doesn t have a  medium  setting but i don t think that s worth 20 bucks  if you don t like the color blue  well you re outta luck  guess since it isn t foldable  it may not be good for travel  whatever  it blow dries my hair at home when i need it to and does a good job at that  will update review if it spontaneously melts or explodes     btw  review is based on the price i paid for it  the price seems to fluctuate a lot so wait until a seller offers it for 10 dollars or less  otherwise  it s pretty much the same deal as any other blow dryer  my wife has had this for almost 2 years and she likes it  still works just fine love this dryer  it s light and dries my br   hair super fast  love it  heats up good  fast delivery  easy set up  works great   it s strong and small enough for travelling love this dryer i have very curly hair and this dryer is light and dried my hair faster than most dryers i am very picky and i highly recommend this dryer  great so far  very lightweight  not hard to use  simple basic dryer  this was my second one to own  it lasted for years  i hope this one will be the same  i recommend this hair dryer  thanks amazon     not as powerful as i would have hoped but it s not bad for a cheap guy  super light  i have a problem on my wrist and usually have a hard time drying styling my hair  this blow dryer made my hair work so much easier and painless  the power is great too  i would reccomend it to anyone  mini and cute even not exactly the same color  still beautiful love it   awesome dryer  good rated this five stars because of br   1  there are 3 temperature features and a bonus cool shot br   2  there are 2 speeds br   3  not heavy   it has a long cord br   4  the 2 combing and area specific drying pieces br   5  the great product   low price  br   this is product is great  and is worth more than the price i payed  with a houseful of divas we go through hair dryers  recently we received a tourmaline ionic hair dryer by rimini and have had mixed opinions on it  br    br   i like it but i also have shorter  shoulder length hair that does not require a lot of work  the girls that have longer thick hair thought this product took a little longer to dry their hair but they liked that it had adjustable settings for heat and that it was light weight  br    br   according to the packaging  this product is known for being  br    br   powerful   reduce drying time and get ready faster with rimini   salon grade powerful 1500 w motor  advanced ionic technology reduces frizz for smoother  shinier hair br   precise   the rimini hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle for precise styling and maximized condensed air flow control to the area you are targeting br   adjustable   with three heat levels and two power levels  achieve complete control of your styling and lock in your perfect look with the cool shot button br   light weight   weighting only 1 3 lbs and equipped with an ergonomic handle designed to suit left or right handed users br    br   overall  we give this a thumbs up on quality and ease of use  the variety of settings allow us to use this for not only drying but also styling smaller areas  the little ones gave it a thumbs up because it doesn   get too hot on their head when used on the lower heat setting  br    br   this product was purchase with a promotional coupon or discount  great dryer     cut drying time in half  looks like a professional job  this is a great product  very efficient and easy to use  love this    it has made blow drying so much easier for me  love this   light weight and dries my hair very fast  love it it s just what i wanted  i prefer this style of hand dryer to others and the attachments are great  no complaints  the best hair dryer i ve ever used     i will highly recommend it to any one  i know this is expensive  but this is absolutely worth the money    you have to use it to believe what i said  my hair looks soo good now  my friends notice that and ask me what did i do differently  every body need to have one   i was hesitating to purchase such an expensive hair dryer  but it was well worth it  after drying your hair   it was really shiny and smooth  hair was static free  no messy at all  someone mentioned a funny smell  it was gone after the first use  i bought it on ebay and saved extra  20  highly recommended it  no regrets  one thing to mention is that nano works well when the air is a little moisture  i use it in bathroom immediately after taking a shower  this fit into my conair 1875  it works great  time has proven this is a good product   would buy another one  i liked this hair dryer well enough until sparks started shooting out where the cord is attached  i only use this dryer 3x a week and it didn t even last 8 months  that s ridiculous  i loved the length of the cord and that it had attachments  i smelled burning and sparks started shooting from my dryer  i throw it on the floor and quickly unplugged it  when i picked it up  the entire unit was very hot to the touch and the cord had completely severed one of the wires  that was not like that before i started  is it too much to ask for a safe hair dryer  best compact hairdryer i ve ever owned  it s works very good  we had the same one that lasted for 7 years  it is pretty noisy  i thought maybe they had made them to be less noisy now  it dosent have hot air  great hairdryer   first used it at a hotel and was finally able to locate one online  works great to dry my daughters natural hair  works well and the speed and temperature  adjustments are easy to use   well worth the small amount it costs  i love this product  it has a good performance  i really fall in love  is simple to use and practice to mobilize i have had the opportunity to try quite a few xtava products and i am overwhelmed by the quality of their items   i d never heard of xtava prior to november and for being a virtual unknown in the heavily competitive beauty market  they really are creating products that will last   i hope that they are able to get a foothold in this industry and keep on making such great items  br    br   the rimini blow dryer for starters  is a gorgeous hair dryer   we desperately needed a new hair dryer because ours is ready to die anytime now   this definitely is a step up from the cheapo dryer we had purchased  br    br   it drys our hair so quickly   even my daughter who has much thicker and coarse hair than myself it doesn t take much time at all until her hair is completely dry   there are two speed settings  low and high as well as three heat settings plus the cold shot button   i find that i use the medium heat and the high speed settings the most  br    br   i also love that it has a little hook on it so that you can easily hang it on a nail for easy access in your bathroom   the cord is long enough to be able to style your hair just about anywhere you need it   it s not like real quiet  but it s not as loud as some hairdryers   it really is one of the best dryer s i ve used and it s definitely the best hair dryer that i ve ever personally owned    i m so impressed by the quality of xtava and their products  br    br       review product received sure does blow hot  excellent product i m surprised at all the fantastic reviews  it s fine  it works  so far  we ll see   but there is nothing outstanding or amazing about this dryer  it is not faster than any previous dryer i ve used  my hair isn t softer or fancier  i do appreciate the ability to set to cool without holding down the button  so  it is what it is and comes with a fair price  take it or leave it  i love this  my mom got it for me for christmas and it s definitely one of the best christmas gifts i ve ever gotten  peopel complained that it didn t have a medium setting but i personally didn t see a need for it  i use it for my hot oil treatments and my deep conditioning treatments it works great  it doesn t burn my neck or ears  i would definitely reccomed quickly dries your hair without frying it     it s great    great dryer   have had it for quite some time and have not had any issues powerful little guy    does the job  neat  compact  love it   jj works great  cord retracts as expected  perfect size  dries my hair fast   i like the built in nightlight  i love it very much i recommend for anyone who is looking for a good hair dryer   roseli i love my wall mounted blow dryer  it puts out a great volume of air which i like and was looking for  it doesn t get too hot     temp is just right  i like the small amber night light in the bathroom at night  i would purchase this item again in a heart beat   very nice dryer   it s not as powerful as ones i ve had in the past but i have short hair  i don t think it would be powerful enough for long hair  it was my mistake not to realize the power level that was posted in the ad  my mother loves this lightweight hair dryer   says its easy to use  i really love this hair dryer  i like that it has black with a touch of pink on it  it s made with sturdy material and it isn t to heavy to handle when drying your hair  i only use the cold air since i don t want to damage my hair  it s nice that you can choose between cold air and warm air and each has a high and low setting  it also has two attachments which is perfect  depending on your preference  this a great product to use for your daily hair routine and it s even a good size for travel  it s a perfect gift to give any women in your life  i m very happy with all the xtava products i ve gotten to review  they re all high quality products and i would definitely recommend their products  i love this hair dryer  installed this unit in my rv   works great for it s size  gets very hot on hi  it still works like the first day i had it  but the retractable cord takes a little finagling to get it all the way back in   nonetheless  it s much better than having all these cords all over the place  decent product  although  the air volume doesn t seem to be as good as other similar products like this that i have bought   i do like that there is a place to hang the cord to get it off the counter   it does do the job  so i am fairly pleased with it  love it  this is the third house we have put these into our master baths   i even have one installed in our rv   so handy and so much neater in appearance  flimsy  does not dry well  not adjustable  will easily collapse on your head  the hair dryer seems to be of good quality so far  but the color is deceiving by the picture   i bought it specifically because it looked purple since that is my granddaughter s favorite color  but when it arrived  it was very pink  which was disappointing   it should have had a better description in the specs  perfect size  does just what i want    no complaints  works great and half the cost of the store  plus free shipping  best ever  has lasted a long time  i love my conair turbo hair dryer  it works great and makes my hair look and feel better  i recommend this product to my friends and family  the multitude of setting combinations allow me to control how my hair dries  its naturally very wavy and gets frizzy fast  but i haven t had any issues like that with this dryer yet  this is actually a really great hair dryer  i love how compact it is  smaller than regular sized dryers   it is almost like a travel type of dryer  i find it very easy to use and that it gives me such the softest appearance with hair  i m a college student so i m always on the go whether its going from class to class to traveling to yoga class gym i definitely need something as flexible as i am  my hair is on the normal side  not too thick and not too thin  it is also fairly straight  br    br    i feel that this hair dryer without the diffuser  black top  creates such a satin feel to the hair and that with the diffuser on my hair gets so shiny  so what i do is do about 2 5 min without the black top diffuser and 3 minutes with it on  the cool thing about this hair dryer is that it comes with 2 diffusers  one wide and one thin   it helps cater to your hair and what you want done to it  overall this is an excellent hair dryer  everything form the xtava line so far has been fantastic  i have received this product complimentary for my review but definitely believe that this product is great and affordable  works great   my 12 year old and 9 year old daughters use it and it s easier for them than using a regular hair dryer  tiny  not the same size as the usual ones this style so keep that in mind  other than that  it still works well  it is a bit louder than more pricey hair dryers  has a distinct rattle sound  i bought this for my mother who doesn t have that much hair  i have a thick mane of it and it works but takes too long  not the best for styling  good product for the price i like this hair dryer   i bought it based on reviews   it is slightly heavier than my old one  but it s well balanced and is smaller  which i like   as far as the placement of the buttons  i find that my thumb goes right between both buttons so when it s on  i don t move either button during use   quite happy with this purchase  just what i was looking for    works great  love it i use it on all my clients and gets very hot very good and efficient quiet too  had it about 5 months   very happy with it   light enought for 3 4th graders to use on longer hair this hairdryer is great  it is so much better than the cheap 25 dollars hair dryers i used to get from the store  no frizz  and i live in florida where we have tons of humidity  and it dries my hair in half the time  the cord is not retractable  but that is my only quirk with the dryer  if you are looking to step up and not pay 100 dollars for a hairdryer this one is awesome  i m truly impressed  nice size   low temp is quiet but high is still very loud  got it b c comb attachment which stayed on for the most part except for once but i have kinky natural hair  use it to do blow out styles we love this blow dryer because it does the job under 10 minutes that is a lifesaver for the people in my home  this blow dryer was exceptional value  best investment needed a good blow dryer bought this as a christmas gift for my 9 year old daughter  works okay but doesn t put out a lot of heat  works great for her  she has short hair  however i have shoulder length hair and it would take to long for me to try and use  great value  for younger girls it s sufficient  i would recommend a better blow dryer if you have a lot of hair or don t have a lot of time to spend blowing drying your hair  lots of power   works great it works great  love it  my daughter loves this hair dryer  it is so cute and works really well  while the flat iron is coming apart in less than a year  this hair dryer seems to be a better product so far  just used my new hair dryer for the first time and ran  yes  ran  to write this review   i cannot believe this is my hair   i have shoulder length  course  thick  curly hair which i blow dry and iron   i have always used high end hair dryers  but this is the best ever   worth twice the price   not only did my hair dry faster  but it dried frizz free   i did not have to flat iron it after blowing it dry   first time ever not having to flat iron   my hair looks like it does when i come from the hair dresser   i can t believe a hair dryer can make this big of a difference  but i can assure you  it does   thank you sedu   i am a believer  great  would highly recommend it the low speed doesn t dry very well   the high speed is very loud   it does the job but i wouldn t buy again  good size my daughter loved it for christmas i love this blow dryer  its small and powerful  exactly what i wanted came in quick   amazing blow dryer with lots of power and heat  this hair dryer is amazing  it cuts my hair drying time to half  with smooth shining hair as result  shipping was from japan  took about 10 days to arrive in us with registered mail  it said nothing about ions in description   one of the questions said not ionic but the box says ionic  i sent it back as it was not what i wanted for my fine hair   best hair dryer ever   need i say more  i love it  it s not too heavy  not loud  the cored about 4ft  gives good heat  and leaves my hair soft and silky  excellent product      this a replacement for another turbo that i bought 15 years ago   and i used almost every day of the week    i won t buy any other hair dryer      the conair soft bonnet hair dryer is exactly what i was looking   i had an old one that i loved but i used it so much  i had to get a new one   one thing i can say is that my old one last a very long time   i know that i will enjoy my soft bonnet hair bonnet dryer for years to come   i highly recommend this hair dryer to everyone who likes to relax while getting their hair dry  it dries my hair very quickly and is very light weight   great hair dryer  nice hair dryer this is my second  i blew up the first forgetting to convert from us to european currency  it was quite dramatic    but i rushed to amazon on my return and bought another one  it really is the best us or intercontinental hair dryer i ve ever traveled with   it gets very hot on high  which is just fine with me   and it s a noisy sucker  br    br   but it weighs very little and is a real trooper  i think i had the first one over five years  and its ultimate failure was mine not the manufacturer s   br    br   read the reviews  most people really really like it  super great hair dryer for very little cost   i own a  200 hair dryer and like this one a lot better  there is nothing more to say about dryer  except that you get what you pay for  it is quiet and fast  like a ninja  maybe they should rename it  lol  i bought this for my daughter  but when she s not around  i find myself   34 borrowing  34  it  hey  i paid for it  don t judge me    love this hair dryer   mount it on the wall in the bathroom and it works great  works great for price  great product i can t believe how this hair dryer made my hair feel so soft and not frizzy  great product bought for my wife  seems to work as advertised  wife is happy  works fine i love this hairdryer   i ve had mine for 3 months and my hair looks so silky and shiny   my hair is very thick and frizzy curly  slightly past my shoulders    i used to have my hair professionally done  roller set and blown out  every week when i lived close to my favorite hair salon   when my husband and i moved  i couldn t find a salon that was close enough for weekly appointments  and it was just getting expensive   i ve had other standing hair bonnet dryers  but this is the kind i see most at professional hair salons  and for a reason   it s fairly quiet  except for the ticking sound from the timer    it goes up to 75 degrees celsius  which is about 167 degrees fahrenheit  very hot   but there is a dial that lets you adjust the temperature all the way down to cool temps   i usually keep mine at 65 degrees celsius  about 150 f    there is another dial where you set the time and it goes up to a full hour  which is what i need   i don t have to worry about keeping track of time as the dryer turns off automatically with the time you set   i just roller set my hair  set the timer  and read or nap until the dryer stops   i love it   caveat  while assembly is easy  it was not so smooth to do   my husband had to re order replacement parts because they did not fit together properly the first time   still worth it  if you have the space to store it  easy mount  heats well works great   i love that it s big since i have tons of hair  it s a little bigger than i had imagined but the weight is okay and it works quick  i haven t noticed any change in my hair texture or look but it works well otherwise  and mine didn t come with a diffuser as some reviews mention  i love it    i like this hair dryer  but it s just not well suited for a man s use   especially in the gym   i had purchased it to dry my hair during the winter months   it is not overly loud and provides a high volume of air   too much to manage the shorter hair most men wear   it s also much heavier than i expected it to be   i decided to go with a model with a comb and brush attachment  br    br   a word of caution concerning the folding handle on this unit   the first time i used it i had my forefinger too close to the top of the handle and it pinched the heck out of me   i still have a sore spot on my finger a week later   be careful when opening  i like how small it is and has good power makes it easy to travel with doesn t take up much room product arrived quickly and worked as expected in europe  i good investment  it s really good and light weight to carry around br   but the only drawback i feel is the souf which makes my lil one run away very adequate  powerful  folds up and the cord retractor is strong  i like this dryer  it s light   does what it s suppose to  the only issue i have br   is it doesn t get as hot as my last dryer   it s not by any means cold   just a little br   less warm that what i would ideally like  but  it works very well for the price  works great  i purchased this to go with my rusk w8less professional hair dryer and it fits perfectly  i love that the bowl is large and really deep  this is a must have for curly hair  i haven t owned a blow dryer in over three years  i chopped off all my hair  i had about 1 2  34  of hair left  to go chemical free  now  three years later  my hair is super thick and well past my shoulders again  i m able to let my hair air dry  but sometimes even after 24 hours  my hair isn t fully dry  i was excited to get this blow dryer to review on my blog  sure  air drying is less time consuming and i m able to do other things while my hair dries  but now i know what i was missing when i didn t need a hair dryer  br    br   if i have my hair styled and i get in the shower  i can guarantee my curled hair will be wet  a wet curl doesn t look good on anybody  with this blow dryer  i can quickly dry my all my hair or just a section because it comes with a concentrated air flow attachment  the buttons are self explanatory  you have the cool blast button  the degree of heat button  and the force of air button  they are easy to press and easy to remember where they are when the blow dryer is up in the air against my hair  br    br   since this is the first blow dryer i ve owned and used since late 2011  i give it two thumbs up  it s a great blow dryer for the price you pay  it feels natural in my hands  and again  this is after not handling one in over three years   christmas 2015 will be my 4th year   this is definitely a powerful compact dryer   i took this on a vacation with me  and it fit pretty well in my backpack  where i only traveled with a carry on bag   there are only two settings  but it gets the job done   i have used full size blow dryers that don t nearly come close to how powerful of a blast this one provides   the plastic attachment that comes with it doesn t fit very well  and it easily pops off  but overall this is a great dryer to use for travel or everyday use  solid performance right out of the box  love it     i hate most blow dryers   they re either not hot enough or too expensive or they feel like they are blowing a soft spring breeze through my hair   this one is perfect   i have naturally wavy hair and blow it straight almost every day   either i m loosing my mind or else this blow dryer really does make my hair feel softer   dries fast  too  highly recommend  worked great for a while  tip of blow dryer broke off in first month  had to crazy glue it back on  just died about a year later  no heat  it was a great price just wished it lasted longer  great i m a guy with medium length hair that needs a hair dryer to speed up the process  br    br   my last hair dryer was a vidal sassoon similiar to the size of this one and just very basic  worked great for several years then just quit putting out heat  br    br   this one had good reviews and was cheap  so i bought it  br    br   although it worked to dry my hair and was basic and did the job  exactly what i wanted  it smelt like burning plastic  maybe it s jsut a new hair dryer  regardless  i am returning it due to another review where someone had a larger issue arrive from this  br    br   i plan on purchasing a much more expensive hair dryer to get a better quality product  wish a company could make a small  powerful hair dryer for  20 that just worked and was durable  very good product  excellent 100  recommended  very powerful dryer  worth every penny  love this hair dryer  delivery was on time as stated  will order again when needed  i really like this hair dryer because i have naturally curly hair and the diffuser works great  the hair dryer temp settings plus i know if it last as long as my last conair hair dryer 9 years i will be happy  this is the third conair hair dryer i have bought great when it works but tends to overheat and shuts down  ver y good i recomendet better than expected   great product  excellent delivery  love it  make my hair so soft and shiny  wife likes it but it looks a bit cheap very good dryer for the price  its is just what i wanted  love it  great my superhero boyfriend bought this for me for christmas and picked it out all by himself  i m having a proud girlfriend moment here  anyways   i ve never had an expensive hair dryer  i ve always used a hair dryer that didn t cost me more than 15 bucks and used it until it burst into flames  never again  this hair dryer is the most amazing thing ever  i have color treated and extremely damaged hair  never has my hair felt so silky smooth after using this product  it s much quieter than my previous beast  the only issue i have is that its heavier than what i was used too  which isn t to say anything negative about the product  more so that i need to go to the gym more often  this is an amazing hair dryer and i absolutely can t get enough of it  i hope this was useful  very happy with the hair dryer  its everything i hoped for lasts for years  this is my second one and when this one dies  i ll replace it with the same one  cord keeper is awesome  i ll never go back  excellent quality blow dryer  hot and dries fast  great great deal  great product for the money  got this for my daughter for christmas  it has great power and dries fast  really good in use great dryer  relatively quite  but heavy  wonderful and so very light great medium sized dryer  wont kick the breakers  i have had 4 of these and love them  this last one started burning up in my hand    i got my new one in three days  in time for another shampoo  i love amazon   mini but works good use it daily  works great and i can bring it anywhere with me  perfect for travel she liked this product a lot i feel this is a very good product   it is a bit heavy and doesn t get very hot   but overall it does a great job  love wish it had more attachments  great value though  good but not as powerful as i hoped   the size is great  this dryer is excellent for being so small  terrific air flow   heat settings  not heavy  great quality  and looks high end  it s a bit noisy  but that doesn t matter much  loving it   very nice unit  heat is good and handles great while using to dry your hair  not too sure about the shine thing   a top tier home hair dryer   it has all the features   more heat  at 1875 watts       salon quality motor   up to 40  more air flow and three times the service life       ceramic pearl technology  ceramics for even heating  and infused with crushed pearls which transfer to hair        ionic generator to bathe hair with positive ions       concentrator and diffuser blower attachments       three heat settings  two fan speeds  and a cool shot feature  br    br   i don t use hair dryers   my wife does  and when she broke her old remington t studio  she would have nothing but another t studio as a replacement   by the way  this dryer has a 4 year warranty  so keep your receipt    in our case  the dryer was about 2 years old but we no longer had the receipt  and the breakage was due to her dropping it and the fan speed switch physically broke       so i appropriated the old dryer  wired the fan speed to permanent high and the old hair dryer now resides in my workbench to serve as my hot air gun when i need one   br    br   not cheap  but a very high end dryer and worth the price for us   by the way  the amazon price was by far the best we could find at the time we bought this replacement  very nice looking blow dryer and performs great too  it is a replacement for another conair that i bought about 10 years ago     i highly recommend it if you are looking for an inexpensive ionic blow dryer  perfect  i bought this in order to smooth out the wrinkles of the 3m indoor window insulator kit  and it worked perfectly for that purpose  especially at the highest setting and with the concentrator nozzle attachment  it did not get super hot  which was good for the window kit   though i have no idea if that s good or bad from a hair drying perspective  i could have bought a cheaper hair dryer  but i chose this one because it is tourmaline ceramic  ionic  has several attachments  and multiple settings including a cool breeze setting    all with the idea that after i was done using it on the window kit  i could provide it to female guests  this turned out to be a good idea  since my housemate s younger sister is currently visiting  and she was happy that i had a hair dryer for her to use  i asked for her opinion  and she says    34 it s great   34  pressed for more details  she says    34 i like that it has a lot of different settings   34  as it turns out  this is in fact the first hair dryer she has ever used  so i might also recommend reading some of the other reviews       love it   i bought for my wife  br   my wife choose this one  br   she said it works very good  br   she likes it  br   but little heavy  buy this people  very strong  can i just say that this is my second hair dryer by remington  i loved my first one so much that i wore it out   a one to many drops on the floor after a few years  nice work worth it  works well so far   temp not as warm as i would have expected compared to other manufacturers  products  and the air velocity not as good even with concentrator   but acceptable  4 not 5 stars  love the product  love the power of this  best ever   we have owned 2  it rewinds every time   has the usual features  is priced well and except for the purple exotic feature  it blends well in the bathroom  super  product came quickly but not sure i d buy it again  the attachment falls off very easily  as with what the other 1  revers state this is not a good device at all  the problem i had with it however was not issues with quality of the overall products but more with the heat element  this thing couldn t heat up and when it got there it could not hold its temperature  i found this astounding considering  i sent this back on got this babyliss http   amzn to 1fcegbh it is of much higher quality  this blow dryer is generally nice  the only thing that i do not like is that it does not have temp  and speed settings  it only has low temp  low speed  medium temp medium speed  and high temp  high speed  you cannot change these corresponding temp  speed settings  other than this i like the wide tooth comb attachment  i have natural hair and this helps me detangle and stretch all of my hair  it works pretty great  came on time  my mom is buying two for herself and my sister  i would recommend this  great price  standard shipping  nice product this was bought for my daughter  mine is about 7 years old  and this one is just as good as mine  awesome   some people described this as being very light  i would say it s normal  it doesn t put out a ton of air and it doesn t feel very hot  but it somehow gets my hair dry as fast as my old hair dryer  and that s all i care about  works great  im pretty picky about everything  but i d buy this again and again  this is my first t3 blow dryer and my last   i purchased this hair dryer last september at the recommendation of my sister   paying over  100 for a blow dryer is a lot in my opinion if you are not a stylist   it has a cool air button which will not turn off now   i can t get even warm air to blow out of it   and by the way  my sister s t3 blow dryer stopped working as well   not worth the       wife and daughter love it   they fight over it  ha does everything a hair dryer should do  sturdy  nice design  powerful  and totally blows  in a good way  this could be my own incorrect expectations  but when they say it diffuses it really diffuses  i feel like i m not getting enough heat in any one place to dry my hair  so i don t use it at all  it s well made and clearly does what it says  but since it s effectively useless to me three stars is the most i can do  xtava blue professional hair dryer is awesome  i have used it several times this week and i am super thrilled with it  the heat can be set to low  medium  or high depending on your preference  i really like that  because when the weather is hot  i don t always want to feel a hot breeze in my face  i prefer it to be medium or else i start sweating  my former blow dryer only had the hot setting  so this is a great advantage for me  also this hair dryer is great because it has a cool switch  a button you can press to get a quick shot of cool air occasionally  i love that it has a wind controlling cone that can be added to the dryer for styling  i like to use a round brush to make the ends of my hair curl under sometimes while blow drying      but i don t want my hair blowing every which way lol  so this is just perfect  i really truly love this hair dryer  so happy with it  works very well  runs great  makes my hair look beautiful  mission accomplished  so glad i got to try this in exchange for a review  new favorite dryer for professional use  i am a stylist and having the right dryer makes all the difference  this things blows hard and gets hot  i use it on medium heat and low speed and still cut my drying time in half with gorgeous results  very little need for curling iron or flat irons when done  time saver  light weight and i even like the diffuser  graduation gift for my niece   she loved it   especially the fact that the cord disappears into it      my son loves it  dries quickly and is very strong  this is a great unit to organize the bathroom  i m not a fan of stowing the hair dryer away in a cabinet or drawer and taking it out for every use and i m not a fan of having it sit on the counter all of the time  this is a great compromise  the unit is always ready to use and it doesn t take up space  also  i am not able to mount this in studs  so i was concerned that the constant off and on might loosen this unit on the wall  there s no problem with that  i even bought an extra one for my kids  bathroom  and you know how kids can be rough  both units are fine and show no sign of loosening  lastly  it s easy to install  love that part  i highly recommend this product  it is ok these are nice hair dryers   i bought one for myself and one for my husband   they re great   every time a guest has used mine they comment on how nice it is   feels like your at the salon  love the lightweight design  works great working perfect  awesome  ive had this for over 6 months  and the cable retraction is not working as well because the cable is all twisted within the cable  if that makes sense   still retracts  but nowhere as good as when it was first purchased  i love this dryer  i like that it has multiple heat and speed settings  it s very light  exactly as described and quick delivery  worked okay for my application   i have no hair so i can t speak to the effectiveness of this unit when used for it s intended purpose   i bought it to dry parts    o  this thing has lots of power     works so fast  and seems to do so without damaging the hair    i was wavering between this dryer and another that was a bit cheaper  but was glad that i chose this one  as it s the most satisfying hair dryer i ve used at home thus far  br    br   my only issue with it is that the sliding switches are annoying to use  as they are very stiff  wish that this awesome product came with easier to maneuver switches     maybe next time  in the redesign  it will  great  everything i expected from conair  more than enough heat for my thick curly hair  love it  except not drying at back of head well it is very satisfactory love it   my wife is very satisfied with the gift that was purchased for christmas   when she is happy i am happy and that is speaks volumes for the product  loved the products and very pleased with the quick delivery  love it  like  many other of the commenters  my conair hair dryer quit working after 3 months   good luck with customer service   they ll look at it but require you to pay freight both ways    20 in freight for a  17 blower   doesn t sound like a company that is serious about finding problems so that they can improve their future products  i purchased this hair dryer at my local sally beauty supply  and i absolutely love it  i have very wavy curly hair  and this dryer got my hair straight in no time  i will never use another hair dryer  try it out  you won t regret it  i bought this for my niece for christmas  i have heard no complaints so far  shipping was fast  i just bought this today at walgreens drug store for 24 99  and this was not a sale price  sorry  amazon  i think consumers should be advised to check prices  i bought this after reading reviews on amazon  haven t used it yet  but it looks good  light and easy to hold  and i like the hang up loop   i will update my review after i use the dryer  great for traveling overseas  it folds great into luggage  just remember to switch it to currency when overseas  works good excellent buy  dries hair quickly and quietly  works great  low price  arrived promptly   the speed settings were just right  in terms of low speed getting air through my hair without blowing it around too much and high speed giving a good blast   the high low temp worked well also  easy to install  just not what i thought  you would need to mount it right that head level  but i didnt like how much less control i had  i ll stick to taping my dryer to my counter  awesome look  good hairdryer the most light hairdryer i ever had  good quality  cord doesn t retract very well working very well for more than 2 years bought it for my wife because her cheap hairdryer was extremely loud and woke me up   this one is awesome   super quiet and she loves it   it is quiet enough that we can actually talk while she drys her hair   that would never have happened with the old dryer   she says it takes about 5 minutes longer to dry her hair  but that is because she only uses it on medium heat   high heat is very hot and she is afraid it will hurt her hair  excellent dryer  light weight and drys hair quickly  speed and heat can be varied to suit whoever is using it  br   the only con is the plug does not fit snuggly in the wall outlet  it s a but lose  but that said it stays in  i would definitely buy it again  perfect travel hair dryer for overseas  good dryer   good hair dryer  cool  warm and hot settings  plus a cool button   i liked the sparkly finish   my only complaint is that it is kind of big and hard to store  fairly priced  works 100 times better than the old hair dryer  i d definitely suggest it  very powerful and comes with great accessories and a carry bag  wow   this thing is great  br    br   no  it s not as powerful or capable as a   34 full sized  34  dryer   but  what do you expect from something that literally fits in the palm of your hand   i  myself  expect a lot less than this dryer delivers  br    br   unlike a lot of travel hair dryers  this one locates the fan at the back of the barrel and has some barrel length to it   this lines the airflow up giving a useful stream of air instead of the every which way mess of air that most travel dryers produce   it s not as directional as a full sized dryer with a longer barrel  but it s better than most travel dryers  br    br   one reviewer reported that the controls are not labeled   this is not true on the dryer i received   the low off high switch and the voltage selector are clearly marked  br    br   several reviewers have complained of it making a very high pitched motor noise  getting very hot  smelling bad  and then dying   the unit is shipped set for 125v  usa  power   while it is true that many modern electronic devices have   34 auto ranging  34  or   34 universal  34  ac inputs and work properly on any line voltage anywhere  this little hairdryer isn t one of them   if you plug this dryer into 250v  european  power without manually changing the voltage selector switch to the 250v setting  the dryer will quickly fail exactly as described   and that will be your fault  misuse  and not cause for a poor review  br    br   mine has worked fine   it drys my hair almost as fast as my   34 professional  34  dryer at home   its size  weight  and performance make this an easy choice for travel  kind of weak did not expect much from such a cheap blow dryer  but this definitely exceeded my expectations  the best compact hair dryer i ever own  great for vacation travel  i love it  heats up nice it isn t to heavy the only down side is that by the switches i have a little gap and on the other side you can see glue holding it together  also the item i was sent was clearly a return the box was open and nothing was in a plastic bag  so far so good but i really hope it holds up very fast and rightly hot  makes a bit of noise and heavier than usual  but i still like it  for its looks and quality  i love this hairdryer   i really like the retractable handle and the quietness of the dryer   my old dryer was much louder  enjoy the settings for heat and power  very sturdy  i have dropped it and the rubbery plastic is unscathed  it is a bit heavier than others  but it seems well made nice perfect  drys my very thick and wavy hair super fast and for the first time ever i don t need a straightener afterwards to smooth it out   i do wish it came with a diffuser though  pretty good dryer  my only wish is that it blew a bit hotter on the max heat setting  it s very powerful however  i luv this product   it s not only attractive but it does what it said  makes my hair soft   shinny  it definitely gets hot  somewhat loud though  i wanted one that blows hard and i could control the temperature too  this one works and the price was fair  does what it says on the tin  a simple  inexpensive hairdryer  i do wish the   34 high off low  34  switch were more like a   34 high low off  34  switch since i accidentally push it too far every time i use it  but it was a minor concern and it s not as if i ll accidentally leave it on  just a minor inconvenience  best dryer ever  br   i am able to dry my medium length  thin hair in 5 minutes  not too hot and the cold shot works great for setting your style  i m on my 2nd one of these in 3 years  i travel with this dryer so it gets beat up  but has outlasted every other dryer i ve ever had  i got this for my mom and she loved it discovered this little gem in a hotel in nyc  dries hair without leaving frizz or fly aways  folding handle makes it convenient for storing and travel  great hair dryer    best one i ever had  it dries my hair fast and i have thick hair  it s light weight  a great price  my hair feels amazing after  it s hard to believe a hair dryer could make a big difference but this one absolutely does   i m sooo thrilled with it   my kinky curly fine thin hair has dried much faster than usual  even though it s the same wattage as my previous dryer  and so smooth  soft  shiny and healthy looking  getting that without a flat iron also means that it gets to stay fluffier looking instead of flat and stringy       i found it cheaper at walmart  but it says it s a limited edition so if you can t get it there  get it here   but get it    it s great  br    br   one thing i have to have on my driers is separate controls for the heat and for the air   this does   and it has the cool shot button as well   the really nice thing if you use the end attachment that condenses the direction of the air flow  is that this dryer has a round end  not oval  so you can turn the attachment when you need to instead of holding your arm wrist in awkward positions to blow at a certain angle   yes  br    br   what this amazon site does not show you is all the info on the side of the box  so i ll take a minute and copy it down here for you  br    br   micro conditioners   get smoother  healthier hair  say good bye to heat damage and say hello to an enhanced healthy shine   this specially designed dryer features a grill that is infused with microscopic conditioners   these micro conditioners release into the dryer air flow  and are transferred to your hair  helping to prevent damage and

love it   get one while you can  exactly what i was looking for  perfect for me  i love it works great  also love the heat settings and the rubberized finish  its a great hair dryer  has no power like my old one   would not purchase again  use it as a cheap heat gun for installing skins and such on tablets and phones   works well enough  girls love it but the lid is a bit fragile nice dryer  the setting selection switch on the dryer could be easier to minipulate but other than that  no complaints  great dryer  excellent really hard to turn on the switches  otherwise it would be a great hair dryer  petit  cute  powerful  better than the one i use usually at home works better than the large one i have and is so small i have had this blow dryer for 6 months  the first five months it worked great then all of a sudden it fell apart  the blow dryer started over heating and then it would shut off then the attachment wouldnt stay on anymore and the comb broke into pieces  i have bought new comb attachment pieces because i dont feel like buying an entire new blow dryer  i was looking for a wall mount dryer similar to my sunbeam that i have had for years  this one was similar in size and has a few more features   the cord storage is wonderful as is the extra wattage  the handle is more comfortable than my old one also  would definitely buy again  excellent hair dryer  love it the speed and heat settings being separate are nice  the anti static seems to work  compared with my 8 year old dryer my hair doesn t frizz up as much  perfect goods  ecommend it  works perfectly as described this is a great little hairdryer   nice for traveling  but i use mine everyday   it dries my hair very fast  and its so lightweight  it s nice but kind a heavy when u need to blow dry you hair your hand will hurt i ve wasted my money on several hair dryers that didn t measure up because the bonnets never fit tightly  they wouldn t stay on my head properly  the heat would seep out and took hours to dry my short hair   now  with this dryer  these problems are solved    it has a nice snug fit with the drawstring attachment  the heat stays in and my hair is dry in no time  i love it  i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i wish the hose was longer  other than that  it s a great product  i love this dryer  it dries my hair so much faster than my old dryer  it leaves my hair soft  and shiny  this is an amazing professional hair dryer    i brought this dryer for my sister as a christmas present 2014 and she was overjoyed    excellent i am a former hair dresser of the 60 s and 70 s  all hair services were done with roller sets and a time under a hair dryer so i feel qualified to rate this dryer  it rocks  the heat and air circulation are great  temperature and timer controls are simple and easy to use  the hood has a clear lift up portion on the hood front that allows easy access to the dryer  best of all its quiet  instructions for assembly are very vague  just use your common sense and look at the pictures and you ll figure it out  i had mine together and running in about 15 minutes  for the money i don t think you could go wrong  the only thing i would change is the plastic legs  but what isn t plastic these days  good buy  great hair dryer i love how quiet this blow dryer is  it has a comfortable grip on it and does a beautiful job of drying my hair without any frizz  i m really satisfied with this purchase  and i totally recommend it nothing to get excited about  it works well and i like the cool temperature setting   the cord is much shorter than the hair dryer i had to replace  i have this for awhile now and it get s the job done after a long while of blow drying  it doesn t get as hot as it supposed to and blows cool air when on hot  the colors are great and it is light weight but if you have thick hair i would recommend spending the extra money to get a better hair dryer  i liked it  it was a present to my son in  law   he was happy to receive it  but i don t have any feedback yet   they are out of state for visit  adequate  not too loud  but only two temps and two speeds  since i knew the specs before i purchased  i wasn t surprised  but i did expect the   34 hot  34  setting to be warmer  the   34 warm  34  is barely above cool  amazing hair dryer  my mom bought me this dryer when i was 12 im 24 now it still works i bought this one for my mom and its the same quality and works amazing  trust me when i say this is the best investment you could possibly make    loved this product very nice very well made  and works great  i have really thick hair and it gets the job done in about 5 min  this was a good replacement unit for the one my wife wore out  this is the second one i ve purchased   the first just wore out   need to be careful to make sure the tubing is not crunched up  but otherwise have had no problem with it   works great  my favorite  easy handling  not big on heat styling my hair anyway but i expected more  it s a subpar blow dryer at best  it ll dry your hair eventually but i also have thick  naturally kiny curly  4a b  hair  maybe if it had a comb attachment to it would have been more useful but just not for me  i can get the blow look with a low heat setting on my flat iron  great product  we were very satisfied with this hair dryer  we put one in our home in va and two of them we took to fl and put them in both of our bathrooms there   i use them often and when guests come they are so handy because they are right there on the wall   we are replacing the one in va that was put in 6 years ago   that one went right in the plate that was already there  first bumped into this product while travelling  marriott hotels do a good job of equiping their hotel rooms with user friendly br   appliances  this dryer is no exception  its  small  compact  hangs easily net to our bathroom mirror  my wife raves about  br   dryers usually burn out besause the user usually forgets to clean the lint screen in the back of the dryer  i have had this dryer for several years  cleaning it occassionally and its still going strong  there are several styles  check the model that best fits your br   needs  my favorite hair dryer ever   why anyone wants one where the cord is all over i don t know   works great and is reasonably priced   highly recommend  excellent it does not get hot  but that s better of hair anyway  nice product  delivery on time  works well  looks good  nice unit excellent i am very happy so far with this dryer   the controls are easy to manipulate  even while drying and styling   the slight downward tilt is actually genius as it is more ergonomic than regular dryers   and the company  xtava  has reached out to me  expressing their desire that i am happy with their product and to please let them know if i have questions   i find this very refreshing and impressive  love it love this dryer  went on vacation and did not take it  missed it a lot    easy to install and handy  i did a lot of research for a trip to england scotland i was using this for  i had no problems at all with this  it was light and compact  perfect to cram into an already full suitcase  please note  this hairdryer is necessary to have dual voltage  they use other voltage there  but you still need an actual wall converter so it will fit into their plugs   this only allows you to change the voltage so that the normal hair dryer you use in the states won t fry your head or die on you  a wall converter is very cheap  about  8 and can be bought almost anywhere   i used the wall converter for multiple appliances  phone charger  etc   but you need to check voltage on other appliances as well  this hair dryer is great  leaves my hair so shiny after it is dried  just the right size  nice to have a timer and to control the heat   the description didn t say how hot it gets but it says 75 celsius and it was too hot for my girl friend and she has hair that requires a lot of heat   easy to put together took less than 5 minutes after unpacking everything  no fan speed on this model   also the description said locking wheels when i bought it and it does not have it   girl friend is super happy how her hair comes out with this machine and that was the whole plan   also the pole is spring loaded which makes it easier to adjust up but harder er to adjust down but you don t have to be super strong to do it   it was easy for me just wanted to mention it because i thought it was a great selling point because if it wasn t spring loaded it would suck adjusting the height  good product  does the job well  good hair dryer  very good construction  good product  like hot and normal button features  amazing product  the cool air feature keeps my wife from burning her neck  best hair dryer she has ever had   product of very good quality  100  satisfied with your purchase recommend this product to all my friends and customers amazon demanded of such items  used it for travel abroad   served me perfectly great product   works better than expected  i bought this dryer based on other reviews that i read   it s not heavy and it does a great job   however  i should have read the product description in more detail  i did not notice it did not have a retractable power cord and it does not have a folding handle for easy storage   i feel the design of the controls to be a bit flimsy  haven t had this style in the past   overall   it does the job and it wasn t expensive  best blow dryer ever  br   no more frizzies br   its a must have i love this blow dryer  the price was great i have short hair it blows it dry in no time  i have been enjoying this blow dryer  my daughter likes it because it takes up little space in her drawer   it is light and dries almost as fast a her precious large heavy one  great product and quick ship   thank you  good product  i love the attachables combs and brush as a afro american it really straighten your hair this compact hair dryer is very powerful but too loud  excellent hair dryer   powerful blower with max heat     this is a newer model of the one that we already had that finally stopped working  we loved the older model and are glad that we were able to replace it with this one  it is just what we wanted  much stronger then i expected great for my tween daughter starting to want to do the grown up girl stuff or for me to borrow for a trip no issues with this hair dryer and its been months  i love it works better than any i have used in the past   recommended by my beautician  very nice and functional hair dryer   easy to mount and easy to use  powerful without harming hair  love how compact this item is   nice not to have to dig around under cabinet to find a hairdryer   it works so well for being such a small dryer   highly recommend this item very powerful fan  it seems my hair tangles more easily because it blows so hard but on the other hand my hair dries faster  otherwise a good blow dryer  great  this is a good quality lower priced hairdryer  if you want better than your average conair at target  this is it  definitely a step up  however  i have since moved up to the babyliss dryers in the  50  60 range  and have to say   huge difference and i will never go back  they are amazing  but if you are limited by this price  it is a great dryer  i received this as a gift because i travel weekly   let me just say that this is the most amazing small hair dryer that i have ever used   i have very long and thick hair almost to my waist and i have never had a small blower dryer that could handle the length of time that it takes to dry my hair until now  this one not only does it  it doesn t even get hot to the touch  the size is what is so impressive as well  it truly is an amazing tool  you will not regret this one   i am considering ordering a spare and i ve only had mine a week and one traveling trip  good dryer for curly hair this is an awesome blowdryer   it has cut my   34 getting ready  34  time by at least a third  definitely recommend this review is for the men only  so i  the husband  bought this for my wife because she wanted something more powerful than 1850 watts  so this was her christmas gift  her old hair dryer took 20 minutes to dry her hair and made it really frizzy  con air brand   she timed her drying with this babbpk2000 xtreme pink edition and it took only     wait for it         5 minutes and her hair was shiny with no frizz  she honestly wont shut up about it  after she dries her hair she keeps telling me to look at it and see how there isn t any fuzz or frizz or whatever woman s hair gets like  hey fellas  if your wife  girlfriend or whatever needs a new hair dryer then go with this one  happy wife girlfriend happy life  trust me guys she will be happy and she will be ready faster  15 minutes faster  so you wont have to yell at her to hurry up and then she gets mad and takes longer  lol  powerful  efficient and convenient  can t ask for more  my wife loves it   fyi  only produces an adequate heat on the high setting  medium and low settings only achieve a warm temp  low price  sturdy  long thick cord  very light  strong fan  great little hair dryer  i needed something that was easy to pack for traveling and had a diffuser  i love this little dryer  best blow dryer ever  i spend lots of money on my blow dryers   one because i have a lot of thick curly hair and i like to straighten it  this works super fast and i am very pleased  good product very convenient mounted on our bathroom wall next to the mirror over the sink  great hair dryer  durable and easy to use  cord will not retract all the way after but i have found that in every retractable that i have ever purchased  best size for soar arms  hot blow drys the hair smooth and silky this blow dryer is awesome  first off  the attachment makes it easier to blow dry my curly hair straight  second  it blow dried my hair quick  i had it for a year or two and then one day it started smoking and caught fire  i was totally in shambles and now i use a s   ty blow drier  rip cute pink blow drier great little dryer  it completes the drying process quickly and doesn t make a lot of noise   it is light weight and easy to handle  my wife said this dryer is like a windstorm in the bathroom  it dried her hair so she is happy  which means i am happy  this blowdryer is really powerful  i love it  i get my hair dried in half the time  i used to have a portable blowdryer that had half the power  what a difference a good blowdryer makes to a readying process  this thing is saving me time  this product does not work well at all  my 19 dollar conair works better than this   i made contact with t3 on their website  they stated the store that provided this is not an authorized dealer for this product and my serial number is not recognized in their system  got the elchim a few weeks ago and love it so far  blows my curly hair out quickly and nice and smoothly  i highly recommend it  nice blowdryer for the price  i liked it but ended up returning b c it was a bit heavy for my arthritic hands  i like how the cord goes inside and the dryer works great  agreat dryer that i would buy again  this did arrive on time  br   thank you  i cannot believe how great this hairdryer really is  i searched and searched for months unsure of who to believe  i have fine hair  not the thick curly that drives most shoppers toward a certain brand  this one works great for my fine hair  and a plus is that i have not had static during the drying process like with the cheaper hairdryers  there are two settings for ionic  and i don t know what the other setting is supposed to do  but the other setting does introduce static  so i use one ionic setting at all times  the main characteristic i searched for was the sound volume and pitch  someone wrote a review that said they could actually hear the doorbell ring while using this hairdryer  and that convinced me to purchase this model  it is actually true   the pitch is not really a pitch  but rather a low sound that will save my eardrums  my husband can actually sleep when i blow dry  where he could not before  as for lasting ability  it is a quality hairdryer  and i have been using this for about 6 months and it looks as though it will hold up for the long haul  easy to put together and works well  super nice hair dryer   purchased to replace same dryer we have had in out bathroom for the last 10 years  that should say everything   the old one lasted 10 years and the fact i purchased the exact same model again tells you how happy i am with it  good one and does the job works great  as advertised and great price  doubt there s a cheaper better one out there  great prod if you have hair that takes forever to dry  this is the hair dryer for you   it not only dries your hair  but leaves it soft and shiny  i have personally gone through about 15 different hair dryers to find the perfect one   i discovered the remington jet dry turbo about 10 or 15 years ago  it used to come in bluish purple   during this time  i ve often looked for other models just to see if i could find something better  and there just isn t anything   many times  you ll find me using two hair dryers at the same time  which often causes the bathroom circuit to overload   i used stylist models that cost around  150  bespoke  rusk speed freak  etc   to consumer reports best hair dryer   which i think the people who are reviewing them don t have lots of hair    because nothing holds a candle to this model  br    br   they also have a compact one that i keep in my gym bag   it s not as good  but will do in a pinch  we got this one on sale for  11 and it worked just fine from march till december  then it quit  no heat and no fan  br   it was good when worked but due to short life span   2 stars at best  excellent  awesome the 1875 dryer is an excellent product  heats fast with with both high and low speeds has a slide high  low  and off switch which i liked   the low speed is higher than i expected but still a very good product  kind of small so cute and small  perfect for traveling but with great power  easy to use for international travel since it has dual power settings  love the zebra carrying bag too  very happy with this purchase    so far so good  works as promised  and arrived on time  great hair dryer  been using it for a few months now and no complaints so far  this is a great little hair dryer  great purchase  i have thick hair  hair dried well and felt silky too  daughter loves it   works just as reviews stated   well worth the money  i m only giving these a 3 5 for now becuase the heating element was broken on arrival   i thought it was strange that it didn t get hot even on the highest heat setting       it was still cool enough after several seconds that i could aim it directly at my face comfortably   on the second try  it got hot for about 5 seconds     and then went cool again   third try   no heat   i am glad i kept the box so i can send it back for my replacement     so i am exchanging this for the same design in hopes that the replacement will have a working heating element   i still rated it as a moderate success because the high and low settings for air  and the three temperature settings are a wonderful design   it blows really hard  which is what i like   i also am hoping the diffuser will allow me to maximize the wave in my hair for those days when i don t want to straighten it  or when it s humid outside    it s ilghtweight and has a nice feel to the grip   i hope the replacement will up the rating to a full 5 stars     update  i received my replacement  what a simple process  too    kudos for easy returns    and this hairdryer is perfect for me   now that the heating element is working  i am able to see that the heat settings are just what i want  cool is cool  medium is my favorite for regular use  and hot is good and hot but not scorching  i might use this on the low blower setting to set a curl when my hair is in velcro rollers    very happy   love the feel and heft of it  too  got this for an upcoming trip in europe and picked this for the dual voltage switch without spending a lot  testing at home on american voltage and it is super powerful  a bit on the loud side but great for the price  wonder if it will have the same quick drying on 240v   they usually only work on low setting when you flip the voltage  this was purchased as a christmas gift for someone other than myself   she called when she opened it and loves it   perfect size  weight  and heat  i love this out of the way blow dryer   for the price you can t beat it   it actually looks pretty cute on my wall in my small bathroom  splurge just a little and get the babyliss pro bab2000   the conair felt cheap   while the babyliss feels much better in the hand   the babyliss will give a deeper heat as compared to the conair  not necessarily hotter but a better and even distribution of heat   i returned the conair  works great   i have very long and thick hair  it used to take up to an hour to dry my hair with my old dryer   this is fast and works great  the best blow dryer i ve ever used   ever   i could go on and on about all the great features  how powerful it is  and even how great it looks but the best feature  for me  is the non slip exterior   i can t tell you how many times my old blow dryers went crashing to the floor due to their slippery casings  but the texturized exterior on this dryer allows me to get a good grip r   and keep that grip   throughout the entire drying process   the best  so far so good   she s happy with the dryer  first used one of these in a hotel  and loved it   the retractable cord gets stuck   but still love it diffuser could be bigger  but it is ok  i love it  i like it  it looks cool attached to my bathroom mirror   i can round brush my hair much  much easier  leaving my coif full and shiny  love it  works great and is do quiet  my husband put it together and got to use it twice  so far so good  but you do need to be careful so it won  tip over  it is a really quiet machine and the ticking of the clock is really not that bad  if i did not hear the ticking i would not know if it was on or not  i can have a conversation with the person sitting under it that s how quiet it is and it gets really hot  my husband is thinking of placing more weight on the feet so it would be more stable  for the amount of money i think it is worth it  awesome hair dryer   definitely professional quality   it takes less time to dry my hair now   also  i love how long the cord is  does it s job nicely   i dropped one star because the dryer i had before did it s job but was smaller  lighter weight  and the hairdryer never got too warm to put away immediately after use   this one needs to be turned off and left sit for a few minutes  love great hair dryer for the price   i battle frizz a lot  and this dryer does a great job controlling frizz while drying my hair  great dryer  better price   good buy  received the item quickly  it is just as it was described  there is no way you get a better blow  this one does a flawless job  very hot  nice machine i love it  always liked them when we stayed in hotels  now i have my own  received it today   the first thing that i did was blowdry my hair  loves it and it can blow cool air too  very easy to use  thanks again great hair dryer i bought this hair dryer about a month ago  i really like it  it dries my hair quickly and without frizz   i have the ion generator on and use the concentrator   also the cord is a good length about 5 1 2  to 6 ft  long   the cord on my last hair dryer was way too short   i would recommend this hair dryer  i already had one of these as my grown children recommended this great hair dryer   i just bought two more to have in our condo for vacation rentals   it is so nice to stay in a place that has a decent hair dryer   this is the one  awesome use everyday    this is best valve for the lowest wattage  i like that it has a cool switch so i don t have to hold down the cool button when i don t need heat to dry off  it looks good and works as you would expect with very simple toggle switches to control your settings  terrific  inexpensive hair dryer   as good as dryers costing 2  3  4 even 5 times this one   gets hot quickly  stays hot  works well  light weight  easy to maneuver   better for travel than most dryers designed specifically for travel   we love it  the dryer is really good but came with a missing part  diffuser  but as it is not really needed  am not bothered by it  arrived early and well packaged  would recommend it  very easy to use  love this hairdryer   lightweight  good strong air flow  and a long cord  we have two of these dryers at home in michigan and purchased two more for our new condo in florida   small but plenty powerful  i love this diffuser  i used this for six months   i actually liked it during that period of time   but after using it once a day during that time period  it burst into flames and practically exploded while i was using it   word to the wise   if your hair dryer starts to smell like garlic don t use it   incredibly dangerous  very good dryer  i bought this for my wife after her old one broke  br   my wife seemed to think that price and quality were correlated with hair dryers  but after seeing the price of some of the   34 high end  34  hair dryers  i decided to do a bit more research   i bought this one because it it highly rated and reasonably priced   i m happy to say that my wife enjoys it and noticed no difference from her previous device which was probably over  100  never thought the blow dryer made a big difference    always thought it was the styling products   guess again this will be the only blow dryer i will ever use or buy again     awesome for curly hair  my wife just loves it heat  power and abilities   she saw it on board a cruise ship and simply loved it and purchased it right after we got back home  great hair dryer   love the controls on this  exactly what i wanted at a very good price i bought this item from 2012 and it is still going strong  it is well worth the money  the only downside to it is that just before the timer goes off  you gotta get up from underneath it because it has a loud sound when the time runs out  i am so glad i got this little hair dryer  i have thick  wavy hair and i need a powerful hair dryer to dry it  this is very powerful  more so than my at home hair dryer  i love the retractable cord  easy for traveling  i weighed it on my kitchen scale and it weighs just slightly over 1 1 4 pounds  i thought it would weigh more  a good purchase  works great  heat settings are good  but it is very heavy and it s so long   i had to stretch my arm way out so the heat wasn t too close to my hair   definitely not for travel since it is so big   but it did dry my hair  this hair dryer works extremely well and is easy to handle   the price is very reasobable  this hair dryer is defective and dangerous  the hair dryer did not work on the low setting  the fan did not spin  i turned it on for only 30 seconds and it quickly overheated and turned bright orange inside and could potentially have caught on fire  the construction of this hair dryer is very cheap and even if the one i received was just a defect  i don t think it would last very long if it did work at all  great price and coality  thank you amazon  love it hair dryer was fair  attachment falls off when drying  this is a great hair dryer but it pulled so much amps that i can t you use it oin my bathroom off of my 15amp gfi outlet i love this hair dryer  my hair is soft and shine and the high heat is not so hot that it damages my fine hair  the only reason i did not give it a 5 star is because the cord is really short  small but powerful   easy install and arrived on time  this professional hair dryer came packaged beautifully making it perfect for giving as a gift for anyone who loves to do their hair  i m obsessed with any hair product so i was so excited to get this product in the mail  i couldn t wait to try it out  it is such a beautiful shade of blue  this hair dryer is 1500 watts which means it can dry your hair super quick  i have very thick and long hair  my hair comes down to my lower back  i was able to blow dry my hair with this dryer in about 15 minutes  that s a pretty good time for my hair  it typically takes 20 to 25 minutes to blow dry my hair  i like that this dryer has the cool shot button  i always use this button when i m done to give my hair a cool down and to lock in my hairstyle  the dryer also comes with a button for 3 speeds and 3 heat settings  another feature that comes in handy is the concentrator nozzle  occasionally i like to   34 blow out  34  my hair and this attachment is a must to be able to achieve this style  overall  i m really pleased with this hair dryer and would recommend this hair dryer to any of my friends or family  excellent purchase  if your hairs are wet and messy  the dryer makes them quick and easy to manage  i love the heat   it s more warm than hot like most blow dryers  i feel like it s better for my hair  very light compared to my former blow dryer  i love this dryer   it heats like a professional dryer   the only con is that the wheels don t roll that well and you have to hold the bonnet when moving it to prevent it from toping over  great best hair dryer i ve ever owned and anyone who has come over and used it has remarked on how great the air stream is and how fast it dries  i bought this for my 90 year old mother  she says its a great hair dryer  loves that it has 3 settings  low  med  high   and that the handle folds  and has retractable cord  also not loud  pleased with everything  great hairdryer  the only thing is doesn t have a dual voltage so if you wanna use it out of states you will need to buy a voltage transformator  great  i bought this for using at home on family and friends and it works just great  great dryer for the cheap price  this hair dryer has a lot of power and dries my hair very quickly when i use the concentrator  very quiet compared to my older blow dryer also  great good blow dryer my 12 year old loves this  it is perfect for her it s great  i love it  it was exactly what i wanted  very convenient hair dryer love it  works well  i don t think i d have paid the original price  glad i got a deep discount  i does dry my hair faster and it honestly does seem smoother  love this hairdryer   i d buy it again   great value   it s heavy and seems like a more expensive hairdryer  works great  awesome dryer  made my fine hair dry in half the time  also gave it more volume   great purchase  great product great great i bought this for my daughter for christmas      she absolutely loves it     an excellent dryer for alot less money than other top dollar dryers   dries fast  and much quieter than other dryers  it s a really good product to the price so cheap  amazing      i have never had a blow dryer so powerful that has so many settings   i like that you can have the same blow power with the cool setting without holding down a button   love it   great price for great quality   it s a fine  but loud hairdryer  you can find a ceramic one in kmart for a lower price  the best      all of my customers are happy works great  really handy and portable   arrived quickly   great product  works great  i use it every day for a year and have had no problems with it  it looks nice too  there are sparkles in the black section of the blow dryer which is always fun    there is also a vent in the back that opens to clean out the dust or hair that gets sucked in  for the money it s definitely worth it  i ve had this hair dryer for about three months and am overall really pleased  my previous hair dryer was about five years old and kicked the bucket  this one is much better than that one  though like i said  it was a little older  it dries my hair in about half the time and i use both of the diffusers that came with if often  br    br   my reason for giving four starts over five is that the placement of the buttons for speed and heat are right where i want to put my hand while using it  they are pretty big  so if i keep my hands there i often hit them  readusting my hand solves this problem but since it makes it a slightly less comfortable experience  i think four stars is appropriate  br    br   i have not  yet  had the issue of the outside wearing off  mine still looks new  what more can you say about a hairdryer  it s hot when you set it on  high   and cools quickly when you hold the blue button  it always turns on when you need it to  that s about all i need for a hair dryer  and this does it  it s hot but not burn your hair hot  and powerful   it s definitely worth buying i agree with all the criticisms of this dryer plus one more  adjustable  huh  you can adjust your height under it but no instructions and no intuitive way to adjust the hight of the dryer  i have the more expensive conair model as well and made the mistake of buying this one to keep at my kids  house for when i visit  my first yellow bird lasted over 7 years and plenty of use by myself and friends  the best dryer ever  this new one works just as well  though i don t think i ll loan this one out so it might last longer  good quality and right price  nice and powerful  strong wall anchoring so far  a very nice dryer for the price  love it  if i could give this product a negative i would   bought my first one with a gift card and loved at it at first  it great power and heat   it lasted about 6 months before it started cutting out  i contacted the seller  but i was beyond what they would cover   then i contacted the distributor who said   34 no problem  send back the defective product and we will replace it   34   neat  sent it back at my cost      receive the replacement pretty quickly  yay   sadly about 6 months later i had the same issue with the new one cutting out  no power   not sure it is worth contacting the distributor again so i can pay to send it back for a new replacement that might last another 6 month  done  unlike another conair i bought from amazon years ago  this one has a cheap plastic smell that makes you worried that you might be touching something toxic  to add insult to injury  the purple plastic of the iron is not the slick metallic looking plastic from the packaging  but rather a gaudy looking pageant queen light purple  great product exactly what i expected excellent dryer  good quality good but can not use in some asian countries due to the voltage difference  the bristles on the brush attachment are too soft to pull my hair strongly enough so that it straightens nicely  also  the drier can t handle the highest strength heat setting  just perfect   good price love this purchase  the heat is just right  not too hot  it sits easily in the holder  it has two speeds which is nice  it great not to have to dig the hair dryer out of drawer   it s convenient to have it right on the wall  i really wanted more speeds as it turns out  not very powerful  i gave it to my husband who doesn t have much hair  it is the best  the strength of the wind is amezing  it is light weight  it came at the right time and i would recommend to everyone who wants to buy it  perfect size with right amount of power   i have very short hair and travel often  this is the perfect balance for power and size  love it  12 13 2014 its a really great dryer  it smooths my hair as it dries  my hair looks and feels like i just left the salon every time  i love this hair dryer with all of the setting it is great for my hair so if you are looking for a good hair dryer this would be it  love it  powerful and totally worth the price  dries my hair in half the time  for just  7 99   free shipping  without even buying over  35 00  this is another very best buy  praise the lord  sturdy  powerful  and comes with 2 attachments  that i don t need   and the lowest price anywhere online  or anywhere i know of   for this level of dryer blower  it has two speeds with low and high heat  and a cool switch  which  like other ones i have tried  still blows some warm air  not the ambient temp      these run off 120v ac   which is needed for the heating element  though  i assume that like other ones  inside is a 12v dc blower motor  these likely do not cost much to make  but some can be very expensive  why pay more  i was really excited about this hairdryer and it s retractable cord  but it really hasn t lived up to the original excitement  as a hairdryer  it s just okay  it s no better than the one i used before  but it does  of course  serve its purpose  although the cord does retract  sometimes it doesn t retract all the way  overall  it s not a bad dryer  i was just hoping for more  its good works great  i recommend it  this was a replacement for my older oster wall mount hair dryer  installation was a breeze  even mounted on my old wall bracket  br   the wife is happy  way too loud and large for travel  returned it as soon as it arrived  good  steady product so far   only concern is the weight  bit heavy  the bomb          i have thick hair and at 41 yrs old been looking  for years  for a blow dryer that blows alot of air  bingo  found it   love love love this dryer    good price good product and delivery was performed as expected broke very quickly this is a great portable hair dryer   my hair is fine and can dry out from some dryers  but this one is really a good product   i love the combination of ionic and ceramic technology  which i really need for my hair   i can keep the frizzies out  and my hair dries quickly without drying out   blow drying is so much easier   i am really picky about blow dryers and my hair  so i am not being frivolous here   this dryer is a keeper  so convenient for travel  this is a very reliable hair dryer and perfect for me by being wall mounted  much easier to use when you have hand problems and strength limits  awesome dryer  it s fast and efficient with less noise than my old conair dryer  fast shipping was a plus  does well so far on high speed but has overheated and shut off twice on low speed  mounting was easy as reviews have stated and it is very strong on high but it probably should be a single speed  the night light is nice to have in the bathroom  overall i m happy with it but you may be disappointed if the low speed is important to you  purchased another one of these hair dryers as the older one was dying   so far so good but the life of these things seems to be around 12 months  can not enough about  thought it was all bs about the ionic  tourmaline and ceramic features really having that much of an effect  omg it is so true  i only tried this blow dryer because i wasn t gonna spend good money on some features that probably are false  even me going cheap worked  do not waste your money on more powerful expensive brands  this will get the job done  you should never use above 1800w anyhow  don t forget to use cool burst all over head after drying as well  miracle worker  br    br   my hair usually takes 40 minutes plus with no brushing  which makes it take way longer  br   my previous dryer had way more w and blew harder  br   this dryer takes my hair 10 15 minutes  maybe  with brushing it out  br   my hair is soft and semi sleek  br    br   my hair is extra coarse  dry  frizzy and thick  this dryer made my hair wonderful  i was able to do things to my hair that i never have before because of it  so in love  worked great while it lasted   which was less than a year  space saver for sure  a bit loud and dryer opening is small  this dryer works great  and i really like the diffuser attachment   great buy for the price  great price  highly recommend   i can even repair your hair    performs as expected  easy to handle  light weight  relatively quiet  good heat control   this is the best hairdryer i ve owned in a long time  this blow dryer is great  i had a remington i bought about 6 years ago and it finally died a couple weeks ago  i wanted a replacement that was low energy but just as good at drying  this thing is even better than the last remington i had  blows faster  dries quicker  uses less electricity  and is way lighter and smaller  very impressed  i am very satisfied with the product  arrived in very good time  very well protected    and in terms of quality  i think is very good     thank you very much and i hope that more people buy it     it really is very good  i bought this for my wife as a replacement for an older conair   she loves the speed and heat choices   very light and easy to use   also very easy to clean by removing the intake cover for the motor   some attachments included is a plus  love it    i ve had this hairdryer for three years now   it s still running great  and for the price  i think it s a great dryer  i have thick  coarse  wavy hair  during the time i ve owned this dryer i ve had hairstyles shorter than my ears and hairstyles all the way to my waist  the choices between hot  warm  cold  and high and low flow have made it versatile through all my haircuts  it s one of the fastest dryers i ve used  and on high  the air has a strong  fast flow  on hot  it gets truly hot    but i ve never had to worry about overheating   the cold shot is cold   my only dissatisfaction is with the claim that it s an ionic hairdryer  they must have put a tiny amount of ceramic or tourmaline into the unit to claim that it s ionic  it does not affect it s performance   but other than that i ve really appreciated it s reliability   for the price  it s great  used this on a 3 week vacation to europe  it worked great  no issues  great hair dryer with plenty of power  however not recommended if the selling feature for you is the retractable cord as this aspect of the product did not last long    maybe a dozen times if that    otherwise  recommended  great price for a great product  i ve had it nearly 3 months at this point and will update if it breaks within a year   the conair 1875 watt cord keeper is  well  a keeper  after several years with heavy ceramic hair dryers with winding the cord after use  the conair is a breath of fresh air  the cord itself is very easy to take out and retract  making it pretty much usable with any plug in our bathroom vanity  when you turn it on  you notice how quiet it is compared to your past hair dryers  comes in handy when your spouse may be sleeping in while you get ready in the morning  how well does it work  longer  thicker hair seems to dry much faster and with it s lightweight use  it is much easier to sustain longer positions when drying thicker hair  the three temperature settings are nice and really easy to get to with one hand  with the retractable cord  ease of use and the lightweight features of this  i can highly recommend it  love the retractable cord  haven t had a problem with it yet  thanks to all i m a hairstylist and this is my go to hair dryer in the salon and at home  it s the best   well worth the money  my last one lasted over 5 years  and i work 6 days a week  not the best dryer i ve ever used but  for the price  i can t complain  love it  my daughter is a cosmetologist and she was very happy to receive this as an early christmas gift and business investment of course  this is a great dryer   i have very long hair  and it used to take about 20 minutes to get it dry   this dryer gets me out of the bathroom in about half that time  used this and seems to do fine  i only wish it had a little more of a powerful blow  may order one for my daughter  great price and quality  love it  cuts my drying time in half  it is a little loud  but overall it works great  i really like this blow dryer   doesn t frizz hair  bought this for my mom  she loves it   and arrived very promptly and packaged very well  good product excellent product and great seller i had to replace my old conair that finally quit on me   i like that this one has a folding handle and a retractable cord for easy packing if you are traveling   i have always trusted conair s products and this one is great  so convenient on the wall    this is my second one  i love it  best hair dryer i have found in a while  it is light weight  dries my thick  curly hair quickly  and it does a good job of not causing frizz  light and easy to use  very good product my wife is happy with the product  seems to be content  only issue honestly  easy to install but the instructions are horrible  could of been done in 5 minutes but was confused with the pole connection  it s more than just meeting both parts together  someone can damage the piece easily  bought as a travel dryer  but it s so light and powerful that i use it at home every day    dries quickly without   34 drying out  34  my hair  easy to handle and not heavy  bonnet too tight  otherwise  excellent  the bonnet has an adjustable elastic  but it is so tight that there is no way that one would adjust it even further  it hurt my forehead  because it was so tight  what i did was cut the elastic  and then just set the bonnet on my head loosely  and it works perfectly  nice steady hot and warm options  and high and low  so  had the bonnet not been an issue  i woudl have given this 5 stars  must have been tiny  tiny heads when they designed it  small  powerful and effective  strong air flow  sure  the bearings get a little noisy but doesn t affect the performance  love hot tools but this one is not turbo  still very good product  doesn t hurt your hair  works great    i ve always loved soft bonnet hair dryers  the flexibility and convenience is fantastic  i enjoy being able to sit on my bed  use my smartphone while my hair is drying  it s really great and awesome engineering  the oster dryer came early and was exactly what i had ordered   i can not live without a wall mounted dryer  because they are so convenient and handy to use   i have had several of the dryers  but i wish they would last longer than one year   perhaps i use mine more than normal  very quick delivery  product is not as good as i expected  not very powerful  although it does dry hair fast  i figured the watts at 1875 would be as strong as my old conair  wouldn t purchase again    exactly what i was looking for   it folds in half for maximum storage   easy to use and i am able to dry my long hair within minutes  loved this compact hair dryer   i keep it in my gym bag   nice quality and air blows great  like options   best deal for the price  update   the hair dryer slowly died after one year of use  not surprising since it only had two settings  kinda powerful and very powerful  it was good for quickly drying my hair  but would leave my hair frizzy sometimes and was a pain for styling  i mostly used it when traveling  i was also never happy with the plastic wall mount because it cracked and the hair dryer sometimes falls out  this was a an ok product  stopped working after about 5 months of use i love the folding handle  retractable cord and compact design  however  mine was a rare anomaly because it overheated and the opening started to contort slightly like it was melting  had to return  but i will buy another one  because i don t think this was the norm  i love this blow dryer and it arrived quickly  the item was exactly what i order  i am pleased with this  this is great blow dryer   heat and speed setting are wonderful   i have past shoulder length hair  set it on half heat  dries within 7 minutes and not frizzy  best blow dryer on the market from what i can tell   the first one of these died on me after 5 years of daily use   i did not hesitate to buy another one   my thick hair is lustrous and bouncy  love this blow dryer works great       product just decided to stop working after a few years  never dropped it and kept it in good condition  i m guessing maybe the thing overheated  great packaging and quick shipping  i love that the settings are not too hot and the low speed is perfectly low  even for a toddler  the high speed will do when she gets older  i m sure  best hair dryer ever  good value but crummy dryer  doesn t get very hot but it isn t too noisy   it was cheap so didn t have super high expectations  love it first the positive  this hairdryer is just the right weight  not so heavy that your arm gets tired during blow drying and not too light either  the color of the model i got is a sort of shimmering raspberry and is beautiful  the cord keeper feature is also pretty handy and so far  after using this dryer every day for almost a week works well  it gets moderately warm and has a somewhat ok power  i definitely wouldn t call it ultra powerful  i have another hairdryer at home which is a little more powerful  it dries my shoulder length hair  start to finish in around 10 minutes  this conair dryer is not hot enough or powerful enough to do that and has taken almost 20 minutes everyday to dry my hair  br   this hairdryer is perfectly ok if you have shortish  or fine hair and are not in a rush  i will use it on weekends or evenings  but i don t want to get up 10 15 minutes earlier in the morning to get my hair dried  great product a great hairdryer  can t beat the  10 price  i was looking for a new hair dryer  and this was one of the 3 choices i had  the other one was also remington   30   and the third was from another brand for around  60  i m not a fan of yellow color  so this was one thing keeping me from getting this hair dryer  when i was looking at it  it cost around  20   however  next day the price went to  10  and i didn t have to think much as the specifications were exactly as what i was looking for  after trying the hair dryer  i can only say the best things   it works perfectly  first one shot out sparks and died after about two years of usage  not a bad run but a frightening end   i loved the size so had purchased a second   34 back up  34  soon after buying the original  put the backup in service about six months ago and the blower on that one started sounding odd recently  today it made a loud noise and a piece fell off inside  i m about to shop for another brand   bought this for my little girl  8yr old  to be able to dry hair on her own  it is the perfect weight  it is cute  it perfectly in her little hands  she loves it  it doesn t have a guard like my conair does to keep the hair from being sucked in the back of it  most women know what i mean  but it is well worth the price esp will all the other attachments included  purchased to take to mexico and it is quite powerful for a tiny dryer   doesn t take up much suitcase space  this is a nice hair dryer  but as hard as i ve tried to figure out why it s a  130 hair dryer  i just can t find the value  br    br   i have pretty short hair and don t use a dryer that often  so i admit that i m not the target market  but my wife has very thick long hair and uses a blow dryer every time she washes her hair  i ve kept a close eye on her hair since she started using this dryer and i can t detect any difference either  so i asked her directly  would you pay  130 for this  no  she wouldn t  she said that it s not much different than her  40 dryer  br    br   i like the fact that there are two independent controls  temp and air speed  that s nice  i also like the fact that you can override the heat and blast cold air on demand  that s a great touch  br    br   but as far as the moisturizing and conditioning aspects  i can t detect them at all  i m not typically such a skeptic  but when a product costs substantially more than the everyday version that i ve been using for years  i need to somehow be convinced and wowed that the product is really worth paying so much more  unfortunately  i wasn t wowed by this dryer  although i m wary that the dryer may go out in the next 8 10 months or start to develop a strange scent  per previous reviews here and on other sites   i am for the most part happy with my purchase especially for the price of  20 for a hair dryer that is still being sold in ulta and other stores for up to  55  the dryer does have side buttons  which for many people was an issue  but the dryer i had prior had the same feature and it doesn t get in my way now as it didn t then  the hair dryer is light medium weight  the swivel cord hasn t been an issue for me either  this is after 1 use but i believe it is going to work out wonderfully  br    also note  make sure you dry your hair 1 2 inches away from the hair itself or else this or any dryer will burn out quicker than it normally would   i was definitely skeptical of the claims of this dryer s nanoe technology  but surprisingly  my hair feels smoother and more conditioned than normal  as if i used extra conditioner or just done a treatment   the dryer dries quickly with strong blast without being too noisy  it looks sleek and  despite the size  doesn t feel overly heavy  the weight is well balanced  the cold blast feature works as expected  the issues i had was with the sliding button controls which can be a little stiff  also  i have straight  moderately thick hair and the  conditioning  effect sometimes flatten my hair  hair can feel too soft that there s not enough  lift  and bounce  this is great when hair is brittle and frizzy  not so great on humid days  curly hair may not have this issue  so far  the biggest drawback is definitely the price  good for basic hair dying needs  not for styling so much  but for the price i say two thumbs up gets rid of the frizzies   perfect  this hair dryer is okay  bonnet is comfortable however the air hose is too short so you almost need to hold it on your lap when using it  also hose and or bonnet do not fit back into side of dryer as it would appear  a bit concerned that i can only use the dryer on low setting because it seems to get too hot  searched high and low for a good quality   stylish and affordable hair dryer  this is perfect     br   i ve had it a while now  over a year  and i am still happy to have found this   i really love the folding handle and retracting cable with the push of a button   allows me to pack it away nice and easily   everything else works as described  had no idea this hair dryer had a retractable cord   i was very excited to see that  works great  but it makes our apartment fuse blow every time i use it more than 10 15 minutes  might just be our place but we live in a townhome   works great  light weight  easy to handle   just what i was looking for   the wife says to give this dryer 5 stars  she really likes it  my other conair 1875 was starting to turn itself off  shorting out   during use so i hunted amazon reviews for a good one with prime shipping  this one came up with the most reviews in this price range  i know i shouldn t but i wash and dry my hair every day  i needed something reliable but under  30  br    br   the first thing that bothered me was that i received an obvious return which doesn t bode well  i ve tried this for a couple days so the jury s still out but right away here s what i like and don t like about it  br    br   pros br    very quiet br    lightweight br    useful attachments br    multiple speed options br    cool shot br    ability to clean filter br    br   cons br    nozzle is longer br    matte finish makes it slippery to hold br    cool shot button is much shorter than older conair br    easy to accidentally press hold cool shot when you don t want it br    speed heat button sliders very cheaply made br    filter is hinged and doesn t open all the way br    br   for price and value  okay buy  if you have short arms like i do  the longer barrel makes for an awkward morning ritual  also  since it s slippery to hold  you have to learn how to hold it differently which can be problem  if like me  you have arthritis issues  with the old conair  i could lazily hold it however i want  i could rest my thumb below the cool shot button since it protruded at least 1 2  34  and you really had to push it down to use it  the cool shot on this one is flimsy and depresses quite easily  i m also worried about the settings buttons  it does not seem very secure and or there is only a small attachment in the middle  in other words  as you slide them  the top and bottom of the buttons are not attached in any way to the unit  they actually stick out a little bit  are not completely flushed against the handle   whether this will be a problem should they come off remains to be seen  br    br   overall a mixed bag but it was priced fairly cheap  will update rating if it does not frizz my hair  anymore than i m already drying it out by repeated washings  f it does not frizz my hair  anymore than i m already drying it out by repeated washings   perfect love this little guy   good for short to medium hair  but not for long hair   nightlite is nice touch  i have several of these hair dryers  i keep one as a back up in case my other one breaks  it works well  puts out good heat and i love the colors  great product  highly recommended  i first used this hairdryer at a hotel  it is definitely one of the best hairdryers i have ever owned  it is small and compact  and folds nicely  it also has a retractable cord  which is a huge bonus  as far as drying goes  this dryer did a great job on my hair  i have thick  coarse hair that is about shoulder length  the airflow is excellent  and this dryer shaved at least five minutes off my normal drying time  it is also surprisingly quiet  as quiet as a hairdryer can be   even on the high speed  i highly recommend  great product  i would only suggest that the cord be about six inches longer for ease and comfort  great product  my kids like it  super product  great dryer  never gets too hot  works great  i use it quite often  very good for this price  i hardly used the attachment that came with it   works great  love that it folds  a bit heavy for someone who has to round brush a lot of hair like i do  great hair dryer  i like that it has a cool blowing feature because in the summer time i can dry my hair without heat  works fine for me  br   the handle is a little big and awkward to hold when i switch it to my left hand but if i hold it up at the top it s okay  the pros outweigh the cons for me  this is a great hair dryer  i watched the utube video of the woman with naturally curly hair and how she used this particular dryer because i have permed hair and need a diffuser and medium air pressure to dry my hair but still keep the curls  my previous sassoon hair dryer did a great job of drying as well as maintaining my slowly diminishing   34 old perm  34  curls but with a little scrunching with mousse and my old  non ion ceramic dryer  my curls still looked good  br    br   with my purchase of the remington ac2015    34 pearl  ionic  34  dryer additions  i looked forward to the same old but better     my hair is much more shiny and less frizzy  yes  but i do have to work with scrunching spray to get those curls that i had when drying with my old non pearl ceramic  etc  hairdryer  i think the ceramic or pearl or ionic features of this dryer are wonderful but  for someone like me with a loose perm of about 10 months  the dryer makes my hair just   34 too smooth  34   br    br   am certain this model would be perfect for all those ladies with gorgeous  thick hair who want the smooth look at a very very good price  br    br   diffuser is included which did entice me to purchase this hair dryer as i do need to use a diffuser  btw  reviewers have said dryer could be lighter in weight but it s perfectly ok with me  i felt my old dryer was ok regarding weight and feel this one is  as well  not noisy at all  despite what some have said  i use it on medium airflow and medium heat and i m very happy   not loud and i could definitely use the dryer for as long as it took to dry my hair if i had long hair w o freaking out because of its noise  best hair dryer ever  it is very strong and dries your hair right away  it also gives a volume since it is 1600 watt  the money you pay for it definitely worth it  my last hair dryer was an andis and i bought an andis again because i was so impressed with their quality   so compact that it fits easily in my suitcase  you feel better when travelling when you know you will be able to look good in all your vacation photos   great as an everyday dryer for those with small bathrooms  excellent product   quick attention very well packed and fast    it is powerful to my wife loves dried my long straight fine hair in a reasonable amount of time  did a faster job than my old dryer  we ve been using that one to roast green coffee beans  so i was needing a new one  br    br   the different temp settings were accurate and the cool shot button worked fine  left my hair looking full with a nice shine  br    br   it felt well balanced in the hand and was easy to hold and work with  not too noisy  big plus  no weird plasticky smell on first use  even bigger plus  br    br   the retractable cord is genius  br    br   if you are looking for a new hair dryer i think this one is a very good value  works great with all the features you need  it works great  is a little bit heavy but has good power  it heated very well  i am happy with my purchase i ve had my hair dryer  a conair mini  for ages  more than 10 years   the conair has only two setting  high and low  and did not come with any accessories   so going from the conair to the panasonic nanoe was like upgrading from a basic to a state of  the art hair dryer  br    br   the panasonic nanoe comes with a quick dry nozzle  a set nozzle and a diffuser  it boasts 3 temperatures settings  hot  warm and cool  and a choice of strong  high  or gentle  low  airflow   what makes this hair dryer special is that it produces nanoe or invisible water particles that cling to your hair as you dry it  br   i have thick hair that reaches to my shoulders and when i used the panasonic  i had the impression that strands of hair were separated  it boosted my hair s natural volume and gave it more movement  and my hair felt softer too after i used the panasonic with the quick dry nozzle and the diffuser   my sister who has long fine hair also agreed that this dryer seemed to give her hair more volume too  br    br   since i ve been handling a mini dryer for years  it took a bit of time to get used to the full sized panasonic  at first it felt heavy  especially when i attached the diffuser to it  and therefore was somewhat awkward to manage   however  i m getting used to its weight and size and therefore doing a better job at styling my hair with it   the panasonic nanoe does emit a smell  but according to the operating instructions booklet  it is normal and harmless  br    br   i m glad i got this hair dryer  i like having the different temperature settings  especially the cool one because i want to avoid heat damage   with my old dryer  i didn t have any other choice but hot   after using an attachment with the hot setting  it may be warm to the touch so handle with care if you need to switch nozzles   this is a great hair dryer  i don t quite understand the fine details behind the nanoe technology  but these invisible particles certainly make my hair look good  works great and always at hands reach  very satisfied with this product  this is worth it especially the price  this hair dryer is just alright  i have fine wavy hair  but a lot of it  and needed a hair dryer with a diffuser  after looking through reviews i decided to purchase this one over some cheaper models or buying the same vidal sassoon model i ve owned for many years  br   my first impression was that i was shocked by how heavy it was  because it s ceramic  it can be sort of awkward to use before you get used to it  secondly  the difference between the   34 warm  34  to the   34 hot  34  setting is pretty big  the   34 warm  34  on mine has barely more heat than the   34 cool  34  setting and the   34 hot  34  setting is too hot to use for more than a minute or two  the   34 hot  34  also makes my hair super frizzy  but that s fixed by blasting it on the   34 cool  34  setting after the heat  but i do worry that it damages my hair  i would use the   34 warm  34  setting if it didn t take so long  br   this hair dryer is kept at my boyfriend s and i only use it to dry the roots of my hair with the diffuser to give them lift  so it doesn t see much use  because i don t use it often i can get over the negatives of the dryer and it is alright for me  if i had to use it every day or dried more than the roots of my hair i would return it  this is awesome i really love it   great value for the money  faster drying without overheating one s hair  when compared to our previous hair dryer  love this dryer   dries quickly and straightens hair nicely  great hair dryer a nice hairdryer   strong yet more quiet than the previous folding model   you can dry your hair in a couple of minutes  convenient for travel yet more durable looking than the older model that i had for many years  first used this hair dryer when staying at a motel   had to have it   i love the retractable cord  i bought this for my wife because she borrowed one like this while staying with a friend and loved it   good power  multiple heat settings  and doesn t have that motor wind that some put out that drive you crazy   the vent poece on the back is removeable for cleaning out lint that gets trapped in there    this is a great feature and should improve the life expectancy of this hair dryer  great hair dryer and the as ones used in the salon i go to  very pleased with this purchase  the different heat settings is great  an excellent dryer  but heavier than most  the retractable cord is a great feature  but adds to the weight  it s a nice hair dryer  has a cool setting 3 diff temp settings and 2 diff speed settings  i knock off one star because after a month one of the points broke off on the diffuser  gets the job done and it is cheap  this would be a great product if the bonnet attached to the hose more securely  love it good its perfect and so is amazon  com it s very powerful and does not burn my hair cute little hair dryer  my younger daughter wanted her own dryer so i got this one  she loves it and so does my older daughter  works great  has alot of power for a little thing  pretty color also my favorite  blow dryer   very strong and fast  i can browdry my sister s 4a b curly hair in 20  30 min and my type 3 hair in 7 10  min  i received the item when stated and it is what i had wanted and expected  it was easy for me to install  thank you  everything was very good it is the good hair dryer   will continue use it to see if my hair can be better  so far is good  11 27 2014 yes  please and thank you  i m so happy with this dryer  i have very thick  coarse hair  4c   medium length  this dryer beat my old conair dryer hands down   it takes about 30  less time to dry my hair  the design is perfect   comb attachments slide in and stays in place during the entire drying process  my old dryer s comb would always pop off at least twice and i ve broken two comb attachments in as many months   i also like the width of this dryer  it does get very hot so use a high smoke point oil like coconut to protect your hair while drying  bottom line  this is a very good product at a very good price  i also got the andis flat iron   my new dynamic duo  a big loud  a bit heavy  very strong  i have to five star this one  br    br   just got this a few days ago and love love love it  i was using a lesser power one before  and wow  no comparison  br   dried my hair so quickly  yet made it bouncy and beautiful  br    br   the amount of air blowing out was just perfect  and using the attachment enabled me to center in on certain portions of my hair and style using it  br    br   i love the bright blue color  it s made very sturdy  and the cord is very flexible while styling  br    br   love  br    br   this product was provided for my unbiased opinion  ok so i have thick coarse hair and i was looking for something that can tame this head of mine  first let me start by saying i do like the retractable cord  must have now  i like that five settings this offers   hot warm  cool  low  and high  i do wish there was a medium  but its not bad  my only thing is i can not use either of the attachments and i know that because of my hair  however there is always at least one attachment i can use  not this time  it gives you recommendations based on your hair what settings to use  overall its not a bad dryer  has many nice features just wish it came with more or different or even other attachment options  my hairdresser uses this blow dryer and recommended it to me when i told him i did not feel mine was powerful enough  this dries my hair in a fraction of the time as it used to take me  i love the adjustable settings for heat and for power  and the ionic blast button for cold shots is great  too  wow   first and foremost  if you have long hair this is the hair dryer for you   i have long hair and constantly fight with the air intake valve on my other hair dryers as they suck up my hair and it gets tangled up inside   the rimini by xtava  has mesh like metal over the air intake valve and cannot suck my hair into it  secondly  it is powerful which is probably why it says professional in the name and oh so quiet compared to all the other hair dryers i have used   third  it is light and the handle makes it so easy to use and to reach the different control buttons while you are still drying   love that it has a cold shot button to help   34 set  34  my hair   it comes with a control nozzle that fits very well and is easy to get off and on to precisely aim the air right where you want it  br   all in all i will tell you this is the best hair dryer that i have ever owned and it is aesthetically pretty too   i won t get into all the specs because you can read them above but it does have 3 heat settings and yes  i use them all during one drying and it has 2 speed settings plus the cold shot button   it usually takes about 20 minutes to completely dry my hair and with this one it took about 12 minutes   i did receive this to try in exchange for my honest review and i will honestly tell you that this hair dryer is awesome  love the retractable cord and the dryer quickly dries my hair  ordered as gift and they were thrilled with quality  price and shipping  good basic hair dryer   like all the rest prolly won t be handed down to my grandchildren  but serviceable  good product i have nin type of complaint  i am satisfied recommend this seller and product very light dryer  and has a nice grip and feel to the handle   i have very long hair and it dried my hair very fast with very little frizz   i would highly recommend this dryer   i love it  folds up perfectly  good heat and power  i am so happy with this dryer  it s not too loud  like the design  and easy to pack  the only thing that would make it a perfect dryer would be if it had a medium setting  i would highly recommend the andis dryer  awesome hair dryer great dryer for the price   nice features   the light may be just a bit too bright  but if you need a nightlight  its  great  love it  dries hair fast without tangles  i love this hairdryer because it s small  and lightweight  yet quite powerful  both in heat and flow   the switch is very easy to use  and i prefer a small white hairdryer to be accidentally seen on the bathroom counter  instead of a huge heavy clunky black and chrome model that doesn t fit in a drawer when i need to tidy up   this one is also small enough for travel  this is a nice looking hair dryer that works fast  my hair usually frizzes out when i blow dry it  but not with this  my hair did not feel dried out at all after using this  the blow dryer has hot  warm and cool settings with a cool blast button  the back opens easily  so that any dust buildup can be removed  the weight is a bit heavy  but the design makes it nice to hold  i took off one star because the diffuser did not do a great job on my wimpy curls  but the other attachments worked out well for me  the color is nice  but if it came in green  that would be even better  the best blow dryer i have used so far  good item amazing design  good power  comfortable to use  our old hair dryer has seen better days so my niece picked this one because pink is her favorite color  revlon is a name that s been involved with hair so i said why not  the dryer seems to dry hair well and my niece likes the color so it s a win win  admittedly  i don t have a ton of hair  and while this is a really nice blow dryer  if you re a guy with short hair  it s pretty extravagant  br    br   my wife and daughter  on the other hand  noticed a huge difference  my daughter isn t a huge fan of getting her hair dryed  and happily  this dryer reduces the torture time exponentially  i want to say the difference is in the diffuser  but there s more going on here  it isn t quite   34 magical  34   but it s close  br    br   the   34 magical  34  part is probably with my wife s naturally curly hair  during the winter months  there s been some investment in products that control frizz  and i ve been able to casually tell a difference between products  with this hair dryer  though  you d swear some really expensive salon grade stuff was used  the results are pretty surprising  and seem to last  i d almost go as far as saying that this could save money  by reducing  or eliminating  the need for control products  br    br   at first  i was positive there was no way this hair dryer would be worth the money  but seeing how well it works with everyone in the family  i d totally recommend it to anyone with curly hair  or who can t tolerate much time under the dryer  we liked the convenience so well that we bought one for the guest bathroom too  i first tried this hairdryer while staying at a marriott resort   i loved it so much that i purchased 3 of them   it can be set to blow at  the highest power with the heat at a lower setting    something i found to be perfect for me  best dryer out there  use it daily so  i got this in hopes that it would inspire me to completely blow out my hair   looks great when the hairdresser does it but i get bored about halfway through   the jury is still out  three neat attachments that i have never in my life used and more options than i know what to do with  cool  warm hot and then high and low  and finally a cold burst    i m used to just on or off  br    br   it is a little top heavy so not the most comfortable   but so far so good  love love love this product salon finishing and the cord retracts  best part had it for over a year it s really good really great   got it in 2 days on a sunday   thanks   i love it  love my dryer i tested this hair dryer against two older models we have  one was a conair with ceramics in the wind tunnel and ionizer  the other was an older baybliss hair dryer  also with ceramics but no advertized ionizing properties  i didn t use a towel at all for the tests because i figured  if it works as advertized  the panasonic should dry out my skin less well too  it seems to work  br    br   all three are very good hair dryers  i think the panasonic did the best job of not fizzing up my hair and leaving it feeling very nice  however  it stinks  it smelled like i was blowing melted plastic all around the room  that is not the case when i use either the conair or the baybliss  additionally  while both the others are premium models  neither cost more than  50  br    br   i m going to let the panasonic air out for a month or so outdoors in the sun  maybe some of the plastic stink will outgas and it will be a great hair dryer  many people aren t as sensitive as i am to these plastic odors  if you love that new car smell  especially the smell of mostly plastic interiors after they have baked in the sun with the windows up  you ll love the smell of the panasonic  i can t stand the smell of fabreze or bounce but maybe you think they re wonderful  if so  you ll think this dryer is to die for  br    br   i think they have the makings of a very good product  that nanoe technology seems to work  however  i m concerned that each of those tiny little water droplets is surrounded by plastic particles  making it all the easier to find its way to my lungs  hopefully  airing out will do the trick but i would still recommend a redesign to keep the hot air away from plastic parts  br    br   addendum  i initially gave the product 5 stars but upon reflection i have decided there is no excuse for putting out a product that runs hot air directly past plastic when companies have been making hair dryers with metal or ceramic coated nozzles for years  yes  recycling water vapor is a great idea  but don t forget to use the best of older technology as well  plus a hair dryer this expensive should have a dual voltage switch  br    br   update  because of the smell  i gave the hair dryer away     to my barber  he uses it frequently and likes it  after more than a year  the bad plastic smell is almost gone der technology as well  plus a hair dryer this expensive should have a dual voltage switch   update  because of the smell  i gave the hair dryer away     to my barber  he uses it frequently and likes it  after more than a year  the bad plastic smell is almost gone  so far so good this blow dryer is good at first but it s quite tricky  the blow dryer begins getting very smokey    something about the smell of the blow dryer doesn t seem right   i wish i listened to the reviews because the blow dryer died after one month and a day  a lot of smoke and fire flames came out of the blow dryer  very scary   do not but this blow dryer it may be okay at first but once you start smelling the burnt smell tuh better think twice when the return days are up  waste of money  do not buy this item  going to stick to the cheap blow dryers  this was expensive for no reason perhaps maybe the watts    1900   only good thing about this blow dryer it speeds up your drying time a  for that  good  amazing love this hair dryer  it is excellent for drying curly hair  which needs intense heat in one area  light weight and not overly bulky  this hair dryer has a nice handle that is easy to grip and use when you have to dry hair for awhile  curly hair sure can take time to dry and this one does not make your arm or grip ache  due to the long use  i recommend for anyone who wants a great  affordable lighter dryer that has concentrated heat  im amazed at the negative reviews  i have had this dryer for about 3 years and it is my favorite  recently  the retracable cord hasnt worked well  i tried to open it to fix it  then i broke off another part  now  i use this dryer 1 2x day  i paid under  20 at walmart  so i sure got my moneys worth  br   i ordered a conair here on amazon that i will be returning and purchasing this one again  br   it is very powerful  i love the retracting cord and fold up handle  works great  i replaced my sharper image ion dryer after 10 years with this model  it works great and has the same specs as my other model  only at a fraction of the price  highly recommend  does a good job for the price  i like the diffuser  just received it  yesterday  delivered on time  no problem   it s so cute and improbable  like a barbie doll toy hairdryer in very pink plastic  just like its picture online in its box  complete with miniature pink plastic diffuser   concentrator  but it works as well as a larger hairdryer  certainly far  far better than a hotel wall dryer  and better than some full sized ones  too  and it is extremely light  not tiring on the arms  the diffuser successfully brought out waves in my hair  the concentrator straightened my bangs   i bought it to fit in my carry on luggage  which it does nicely  what s not to like  i have had a hair dryer for years when it gave out  i have always used con air products and have been very happy with them  this hair dryer does not disappoint   great product has several sets to choose from and a cool button which is really neat feature i never had that before  it has high power but not overwhelming for you or your hair  love this product and love conair  excellent product      like many people  i have been buying the very cheap hairdryers sold at consumer retail stores like kmart and walmart  i assumed they were good enough but they never last very long  i finally decided to get a pro model  this hairdryer is what my hair stylist has so i decided to try it  i am sorry i waited so long to treat myself to such a nice experience  the quality of the air flow  the excellent sound and the overall feel is well worth the cost  i hope it will last many years  br    br   i do wish the diffuser had come with it  however i have one on order  also i took off a star because i would like high heat on low fan to be just a little hotter  light weight and efficient   very easy to use   just what i wanted for travel  when i don t want to take my big heavy dryer  good solid unit   feels super well constructed   i am an electrical engineer and appreciate the solid heavy motor   this likely means it will last   it moves a bunch of air   it heats quickly and strongly without odor   does a terrific job on hair   noise level is quite low for the amount of air its moving   the surface finish remains excellent after 6 months of heavy use   my wife loves it   the buttons are placed such that neither one of us inadvertently changes the settings during use   neither of use uses the attachments so no help there  br    br   while i stress the solid feel of the unit as a good thing  i don t feel it is too heavy and neither does my wife   i guess it depends on your expectations   it will probably strike some as too heavy   not us  excellent product for such a great price  hearts well  folds even better  impressed    update      after using it maybe once a month  4 5 times since purchase  the retractable cord no longer works  very surprised because it seemed like a pretty good product  still works decently well but that sucks  it is the best super deal   super price   i bought this on amazon after reading reviews   it works great   i have no complaints whatsoever  fine product the retracting cable feature stopped working on me after a year  the dryer still works great after every day use  works great this is a really good hair dryer  most other models either have low airflow or are very loud and hurt my ears  this one is hot  has high airflow and the sound is soft and easy on my sensitive ears  great product and price  strong airflow and nice setting options  get s my very long hair dry fast  replaced older model that i had had for over 5 years  hope this one last as long this is lightweight and powerful   i bought three of them so that i could use two as gifts   i love it  dries my hair very quickly  the different heat settings are wonderful  it works perfectly  really good blow dryer my first 1 finally just burnt out after 4 years  and i refuse to use a different blow dryer besides this 1    so i m onto my second 1 but hey after 4 years its about that time  mom loves it and it works so i guess it s great  very high powered drying with 3 heat settings  and 3 power settings   really like the way it streamlines the air   have not tried the diffuser yet but i am sure it works well   got it to replace a 20 year old dryer that was on its last leg   only one coil was working   dries my hair in about a third of the time   would recommend to a friend  i like the blow dryer  i thought it was going to be a compact size but nope its a big one  i love the color and its very light weight just got the remington last week  cant be more happy with it  the three temperatures on it are just right i am excited to say that  there is an actual difference between hot and warm air  unlike most other hair dryers this one does not damage or overheat  my hair   after i m done using it my hair feels soft and doesn t feel tangled  br   another great thing about it is the amount if air this little guy pushes out  i can dry my hair on a cool setting withing 5 minutes no problem  and if i use warm air it takes me about 3 minutes  br   this hair dryer is pretty light weight so styling my hair easy and takes little time  br   love this model especially with the cost of it  it s a great buy  if you are in the market for a good hair dryer   and are looking for a reasonable price this is it   worth every penny  what an ingenious idea     great hair dryer  this dryer is amazing  it takes some precision switching fr hot to cool   vise versa  otherwise it s great   i can mount on the wall folded in half w no cord  perfect size for gym bag it s the best hair dryer ever  love it soooooo much  after using it  my hair becomes more shining and healthy  definitely recommended for everyone  this hair dryer does a wonderful job   my hair comes out shiny and  with the diffuser that is included  i can maintain the curls and waves that are natural to my hair   the nozzle can be set for precision when drying and there is a cool shot button in case the air feels too hot   three temperature settings make this dryer versatile and useful for wet or damp hair   there is also a quick dry nozzle attachment that disperses air throughout the head and makes drying very quick   i would only recommend this if you are in a  rush because i found my hair duller looking when i used this attachment   however  there are days when a quick dry comes in very handy   the hair dryer s description says that it utilizes ions in the air to maintain moisture in your hair   whatever method it uses  it really works and is the nicest dryer i ve ever had  hair dryer is very suitable for my fine  short and not very thick hair  i used it on the lowest setting and it felt just right  gentle and not extremely hot  i also liked its comb attachment  it helped me dry hair faster  br   comparing this dryer to my older philips  i moved so i had to leave it in another country   i must note that this dryer provides weaker blow  i think it is because of much bigger output vent  br   minus 1 star because there is no ceramic heating element   just wires  great product   great good product and good company to order from  product as advertised   works well   boost button nice feature   power switch seem a tad fragile   i am satisfied with this purchase  still going strong and i use it daily works great it works very good and really worth its price  recommended     grand budget buy plenty of power and heat and nice and compact too  great small blower for home  its compact and slick design   just make sure don t drop on the floor  it might damage the fan easily  i am not one to buy an expensive hair dryer  but this panasonic with nanoe technology is worth every penny   the quality is self evident when you open the package and pull out this professional sized hairdryer   although it looks like it would weigh a lot  it is surprisingly light and easy to handle  the controls are simple on the handle  with one side of the switch for temperature  cool  warm  and hot   the other switch is for high or low air flow  yielding 6 possible combinations   the nanoe comes with three nozzles  which slip onto the front of the dryer   the set nozzle for precise styling  the quick dry nozzle for drying hair quickly and the diffuser for creating full bodied hair with volume and styling   the is also a cool shot button on the handle to temporarily turn of the heat  to allow time to style   the dryer comes with a heavy duty 9 foot cord with a safety overheating reset plug  br    br   the panasonic has nanoe technology  which takes moisture from the air and your hair and puts moisture rich particles  small enough to penetrate your hair shafts   that s quite a mouthful   what it did for my hair was make it soft and silky  and i can see nuances in the color which i didn t notice before   the blonde is blonder  the brown is richer   my hair dried quickly and quietly  none of the loud buzzing in my ear   as i run my fingers through my hair  there is none of that dry  frizzy  overblown feeling with my lower priced dryers  br    br   for results like this  you need to make an appointment at a salon   if this is in your budget  highly recommended  not happy at the quality of hair dryer for the price i paid 28  better version at costco for 20  i had a previous conair hair dryer that lasted 10 yrs and was very happy with it  this one had cheap plastic on off button and just low high speed blower  i bought this for my rental and haven t tested it out myself but it s perfect for that   not sure about everyday use  loves  br     great for travel br     includes a storage bag br     and includes two additional pieces to attach  concentrator   diffuser  br     small   lightweight br    br   the bads  br     does not have cold air setting br    br   i purchased this when i was in college  at the college store   and it was perfect for the constant back and fourth travel  and i still use it to this day when traveling  i love how small it is  and yet it still gets the job done  very very good quality worked for 5 seconds then stopped working   due to moving  this disappeared so i couldn t return  but i must have gotten a dud   i m going to stick with my regular ionic blow dryer for gentle effective hair drying  love this hairdryer  i found it in a hotel in houston and had to have one for my own  it blows at a great temperature  just hot enough but not so hot as to burn you  but is very fast due to the high velocity of air it outputs from the dryer  this is the fastest  and best  dryer i have owned  very convenient  love it  hve it in every bathroom great professional hair dryer   the only reason i d dock it a star is the noise   i m thinking about buying the silencer to see if that will help   otherwise it really gets the job done  great dryer   does its job   no complaints   br   weight and feel are great   so no issues  br   the rotating handle is a little strange  but it is a nice feature when it does need to be folded   stashed away  good value  not super strong  but does the job  can t beat the price    we love it  we put it in our rv because an rv that we owned had one and i think that they should be a standard feature in all rv s i absolutely love this hair dryer  its construction makes it easy to handle regardless of which portion of my head i am drying  it also does a beautiful job of drying and subduing the texture of my fine  course 4c hair  i don t have to use high heat to get the results that i am loving  loving  loving  i have always loved conair products and used them for years  i had an old conair hair dryer since early 2000 s and it finally took a dive  what i loved about my old dryer was how lightweight and powerful it was  i searched on amazon for the same and or similar style and came across this  the conair 1875 watt tourmaline ceramic hair dryer is as good or better than the older version  which had the same wattage  it is lightweight  powerful  and so comfortable to use  the switches were an important part for me  i love the slide switches because you can grab it by the handle and not accidentally turn it off while you re using it  i have very long and thick hair and this gets the job done  if you re the type of person who doesn t want sore arms when drying your hair  this is perfect for you  good  work well i had used it once in a hotel   i like it getting my hair dry as faster as my old one  and a big plus is it didn t sound loudly as my old one   yes  it s just as what i want   then i rushed online  and ordered it   it s been 4 months since  it s still working good   love it  super good  this is a great hair dryer and i love that it hangs on the wall  right where you need it  does the job perfectly and fitted my hairdryer with no issues  this is completely adorable and comes in a zebra striped bag   what s not to love   oh yeah  great job at drying my hair as well  this item is exactly what i replaced  thank you i was replacing this unit with another sunbeam wall mount that my wife had for nearly 10 years  when this arrived first the hi low setting didn   work  also it isn   hard wired so you have a cord dangling off the wall  that was my fault i didn   realize it when i ordered it  so i returned it with no hassle and ordered the wall mount hard wire unit with three settings and no cord to tangle  a happy wife is a happy life  i have had this for less than a month  i love it  but after the 2nd time i used it  it started sending blue sparks out  it is the best hair dryer ever  and i m afraid to use it because it might explode or set my hair on fire  i know there is a warranty on it  i have just emailed remington  but have not heard back yet  i would have given this 5 stars if it wasn t sparking in my hand  hopefully they will send me new one  absolutely love it  a great hair dryer   excellent features  and very attractive  fits great   works great  so far no problems with it just a bit heavier but nothing else    this is a good little hair dryer  the only problem is the noise it produces  it sounds like a jet engine in the   34 high  34  mode  best dryer a gir could ask for   this is perfect for my natural hair works great  space saver  works great does its job  love the cool sitting and the feel of it  works as expected    great   the individual heat   fan speed controls are a very nice feature  this is a nice dryer but i saw no change in the time it took to dry or the way my hair felt and looked after use  br   bottom line    not worth the     love this dryer  best i ve ever owned  love how it is so quiet as well  even my son said it s the best  cute but cheaply made  although i bought this for travel  i like it more then my regular sized dryer  br   its pink but appears purple in the picture  thats the only reason i gave it a 4 instead of a 5  worked fine for me my favorite hair dryer over the yrs  great for traveling as still find the occasional lodging without dryers  good buy best that i have ever owned  love it its okay but with only 2 heat control is not good so far so good  it s fairly compact and not very noisy  i would have liked a bit more air volume  but it s ok in that respect  the night light was too bright so i disabled it  if it lasts as long as my previous andis  which was 18 years  i ll be well satisfied  works perfectly  strong and compact excellent  powerful motor and it leaves my hair very shiny love it   not an overly strong blow dryer which i like because i don t have thick hair   it s nice and light so my arm doesn t get tired   no frizz either  i love it     makes my hair so smooth with no frizz  good size  good power  i used this hairdryer for the first time at a resort that we were staying at and just loved it   i loved the idea of the retractable cord and folding head   it just seemed to dry my hair so much easier and better that what i had used previously   before i left the resort i went to my computer and looked it up and was amazed at how reasonably priced it was and ordered one right then   i highly recommend this dryer  excellent      good quality good i like this hair dryer  it s worth the price  thank you excellent  finally my hair is like at the hairdresser hahaha i liked this dryer a lot  and it was a great dryer for the price   however  a month after the warranty expired it started shooting out green sparks and losing heat   probably won t bother with this brand again  as i see the same thing has happended to other users  awesome  worked just like it said it would  this inexpensive blow dryer works great  i m an african american woman and my hair isn t straight  this gets it there  my daughter has curly hair and this does the job on hers as well  i love it  it s a quick and easy blow out  work great   i really like this hairdryer   i bought it to replace my andis 30975 hd 10l 1600w quiet hangup hair dryer with night light   that dryer broke after a year of use and had a disgusting bright green nightlight   this sunbeam is wonderful   it is very powerful and super compact on my wall   the only complaint i have is that the on off button are not on the handle but on the hanger   i prefer it to be on the handle but that is just a personal preference  light and very quiet  dries my thick hair quickly and makes it really smooth  awesome  works great  strong wind works great  i needed a good blow dryer because i m going natural and this is what i needed to keep my hair healthy the quality is nice and the price is nicer  i spent more money on this dryer than i have any other before  was it worth the price  i don t think so  br    br   it is a decent dryer    super fast drying   so if you have thick hair  you ll love it  my problem is i have thin  fine hair and i d prefer a lower setting  i can use the   34 scalp setting  34  but even that is a bit powerful  i like a lower setting to style my hair better  this just blows it in all directions  i don t see that much difference to be honest in the end result as i get with any other dryer  br    br   i won t send it back   does the job but i still like my old dryer best which is no longer made  its a hair dryer  works fine  i bought this hair dryer after researching for more than probably 20 hours to figure out which one would fit my needs  etc  it has been well worth it  my hair dries more quickly and i m getting awesome results with my round brush like i usually get at the salon  i would definitely recommend this product  br    br   even though i would recommend this product  i am highly disappointed to find out that buying through amazon and a 3rd party i am not covered by the warranty because neither of the companies are authorized resellers of the product  i found this out as i was completing the warranty form that has to be sent in  had i known this ahead of time i would have gone to one of the authorized seller sites and paid  2 more to have a 1 year warranty  i am returning to amazon as one of the authorized sellers has 20  off and no tax  excellent bought this so that my 9 year old could begin drying her own hair   she liked the bag that it came with and she has no problem holding it   the full size driers are a bit heavy for her   if i dry her hair i still prefer the beastier full size    its faster  perfect  i could kick myself for throwing away my old bonnet hair dryer twenty years ago   it worked fine but blow dryers were more efficient   i bet that if i still had it  i could plug it in and it would work much better than this model   this model is such poor quality i m shocked that someone would even sell it   the unit is ok  after 3 uses  but the bonnet is so cheap that the plastic connector pulled away from the bonnet on the second use   i suspect that the glue they use is not heat resistant and it melted  because it started to emit a chemical smell right before the plastic ring fell out of the bonnet   do yourself a favor and spend the extra money for a reputable manufacturer  it s a nice hair dryer  dries hair good  has different options to chose wether you want to dry it with cold  warm or hot air  during my life i had different kind of hair dryers  and this one is as good as my other ones  did not really noticed the difference  but it does what any hair drier suppose to do  and yes  it s made in thailand  the only negative reviews i read about this  and all other dryers  is that some die too early  hopefully this one will not suffer from early death syndrome  it is ideal for bathrooms with limited counter space  we are extremely please with the design and the white night light is a nice feature and not too bright as was mentioned in reviews of alternative models  chose this one after analyzing reviews of all models  it is a little more expensive but well worth it  very lightweight but powerful  my hair gets dried very quickly  really nice find   saw this first at a prominent new york hotel and thought  if it s good enough for them       we ve been very happy with it   how long it ll last   who knows   but so far  so very good  dryer is excellent  night light not to good  this is the second time i ve purchased this dryer  it s long lasting  i had my last dryer for 5 years and it only broke because i dropped it twice really hard on tile floors  it still worked but i could hear it was not doing well so i purchased another one  if you need a diffuser  bio ionic universal diffuser fits perfectly  this is the best dryer for thick hair and beauties with natural curly hair textures  its really strong  i do hair on the side and its perfect for heavy use  perfect  always liked these off the counter dryers in hotel rooms  works great and it is nice and compact  excellent  will surely buy again  does the job right  great buy  it dries my hair so quick leaving is so smooth  love it    a good buy for the money  perfect for anyone  i use two of these in a rental condo with zero problems  good hair dryer but kinda heavy wonderful hair dryer   i bought this one for my camper and after using it i put my more expensive one in the camper and brought this one in the house  it dries my long hair much faster and somehow leaves it less frizzy   i was skeptical of the ionic feature but after using it i will not use anything else   i love it  more money makes for a better upgrade  this hair dryer is the best anywhere  this is my second purchase due to one of my granddaughters breaking the previous one  will order again in the future if need be  was easy to install  instructions made installation seem more complicated that it was  and works well  no louder than your average dryer    i like not having to unplug my dryer  wrap the cord up  and place it in a drawer   what can i say  a minute saved is a minute earned  and i reclaimed much needed drawer space by replacing my old  bulky  heavyweight dryer with this wall mounted one   i only wish i had purchased it earlier   it is also very lightweight so my arm doesn t get tired when i m drying my hair  awesome                     it s really safe  and convenient  i could curl my hair or just dry it  great i love it   it s perfect   it actually works and does what it says it will   accurate temps and a wide range of temps   very adjustable   only slight downside is it requires a strong hand to screw in stuff when setting up otherwise it s wobbly  i found the conair 1875 watt tourmaline ceramic hair dryer very hard to turn on  choose my heat selection and choose the intensity of the blower   i think conair should have made the ridges on the two selectors more pronounced   i also found the low setting far too powerful to comfortably style my bangs   what i do like  compared to other hair dryer makes is that the cold air button was extremely user friendly   the dryer itself works just fine and is comfortable to hold  small  light  powerful  good amount of heat  would like it to have more power but love that it is more quite than most   this hair dryer works well and i always use it on high as anything lower is not very strong at all   its a great price for the quality  br    i bought it to replace one that was screaming loud and it is so much more quiet than my old one  i appreciate that it will not make me loose my hearing while helping me have a good hair day  used this for year  still awesome  does good strong powerful air flow  dries hair quickly  nice compact size  lightweight   wish it had a better button for controlling the  shot of cool  setting  very good   excellent  it works  i love it  best dryer i ve had in years  this has to be one of the best hairdryers ive bought  the plum sparkle coloring is spectacular  it is a little heavy but not real noticeable  the only thing that   34 erks  34  me is where the buttons are  if you are use to holding it a certain way  you may have to change that  i miss having a rewindable cord too  but thats okay with me  it is great  my hairstylist even thinks so  i love it  works great so far  heats up fast  and was a good price  no issues so far  great for home use       excellent i don t know why there are so many negative reviews  other than maybe operator error  this hair dryer is great  it dries my hair much faster than my other revlon which is about 3 years old and i love the different settings  i wash my hair every other day  so it doesn t get daily use  but so far so good  the cord will only retract well if you have the handle extended  if you try to fold the handle and then retract it wont work  it is nice and compact to keep folded in my bathroom  i can t say i am disappointed  but my last conair was better   however  it burnt out within a year  possibly because i dropped it  but this time i didn t want to spend too much cash to replace it and that one is no longer available   fyi  the one i had and bought on amazon was   conair 213xp infiniti professional tourmaline ceramic technology ionic styler  black br    br   i selected this one because i was so pleased with the last one  br    br   the color and functionality of this dryer are it s best features   it probably makes a better   34 travel  34  dryer than anything   it doesn t allow you to adjust the temp  cool  warm  hot   but it does have a cold shot button   you can only choose high or low speeds   i totally missed those details in the online description that before my purchase   i did watch the video and it is what sold me  but the video makes this dryer look more powerful than it really is   perhaps if you don t have thick hair like me it would perform more to my liking  br    br   in my opinion  i don t think it is even close to salon performance   it says it uses ion technology  but my last conair that was labeled ionic worked so much better and dried my hair faster with hardly any frizz   this gets the job done  it dries my hair pretty fast  but my hair is very frizzy after which annoys me   i will probably take the plunge and buy a higher end hair dryer in the future  until then  this is ok and will get me through  blow dryer is awesome   works great on high heat dryer blows hair so hard you cannot style the hair  it just frizzes  on medium heat the dryer doesn t get hot enough when styling  it takes forever to dry on medium  in my opinion this unit is best as a blow   34 dryer  34   not a styler  excellent product  light  powerful and practical  i had been using something similar for years   it had belonged to my 95 year old mother and lasted through her life and most of mine and one morning i turned it on and zilch  it had died   since i am pretty much housebound i wondered what to do next   good ole amazon came to the rescue   it arrived much sooner than originally planned and i was delighted   the equipment works extremely well with various speeds and protective gear for a bathroom switch   the only fault i found was that there were other pieces for directing air flow that came with no explanation of how to connect them   i don t use them anyway but it would have been nice to have had some directions especially for the mechanically impaired like myself   otherwise a wonderful hair dryer for a cheap price  great hair dryer  gets your hair dry in no time and the cord  gets store in the same dryer  my daughter loves it  thanks a lot   good  very strong wind good deal great value   not a professional one  but great for home use  i have purchased this blow dryer more than once over the years and i like the way it works i love this dryer  keeps countertop de cluttered and right at hands reach  i was used to more air pressure but have adjusted to it  my sister also bought one and loves it  this item works well  although the medium and high settings seem to be the same  but it didn t really bother my because i was trying not to use it on such a high setting anyway to prevent damage   my only complaint is that i wanted to dry my hair using the cool button  i found that pressing it made my hand hurt  it wasn t easy to hold down  felt like i was getting a cramp  and depending on what product you have in my your hair the whole dryer might slide from your hand  other that that it seems to be a good product  it gets the job done  and doesn t feel wimpy in the hand   if you have curly or corse hair then you won t find the brush attachment helpful  love it so far  very strong blowing unlike some of the other dryers i ve owned  the cord does not retract very well  good product for it s price  i think i should give this hairdryer a five star cuz for the price and the size  it s definitely a satisfactory for me  would be perfect if it could bent but what the heck  br   it does the job really good with 1200w  the nozzle of course helps a lot  br   i got the older blue conair travel hairdryer  can t remember the name and i liked it  but this one is way better  this works great i love it  good price  blow strong  not too big   love it  great hair dryer  salon quality  fast shipping  i absolutely love this blow dryer  its lightweight  easy to handle  quite and powerful  great buy just ok i am not a salon styilst  just someone who likes to dry her hair at home at anytime  even at midnight if it is when the time is available  i used to go to a beaty salon to have my hair dry  it took usually 45 50 minutes for my stylist to dry my hair  which is just not long  thick and wavy  i have a lot of it  too  my stylist used to joke saying i had to heads in one  but sometimes another stylist would come to give her a hand    imagine to people pulling at your hair at the same time    it felt as if they were trying to split my head in two  sometimes    my stylist is great  and became my great friend  but no matter how well she treated my hair  and how many conditioners  etc  i used  my hair got scorched enough that a some of it was always breaking in half  the natural waviness lost in an ugly way  the half of the hair closest to the roots  the other half wavy still    when i had my hair wet  it looked weird   br    br   one day i decided to get myself a blowdryer  and got the fhi 2000  which turned out to be great  and while drying my hair with difficulty at first  because of my lack of practice  i managed  seating in front of a mirror  i would bravely spent 1 hour drying my hair  it was worth it  my hair changed a lot  and the huge amounts of money i used to spend at the beaty salon were no longer necessary  once i encountered my former stylist in the supermarket  and she thought i was visiting another beauty salon  she didn t believe me when i told her it was me  she didnt tell me  but from her face i could tell she didnt believe me   br    br   after a bit more than 3 years  my fhi dryer fell to the floor and the little fan inside broke  i strongly advise you not to attempt repair with any other generic piece of whatever that is not original or not from the fhi repair service  if they have any  i dont know  because i live in the caribbean   i did that  and regretted it a lot  since the repaired dryer damaged my hair  i had to condition it lots and lots afterwards  but i have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage  grrr    br    br   then i decided to get myself a nice  professional hair drier  and checked the babyliss pro with all the great feedback  after using it and learning to manage it  because it is so fast    i cannot stop myself from congratulating me for my accurate decision  my sister tried it  she has wavy and think hair too   and immediately ordered one for her  i dry my daughter s and mother s hair too  the drying time is much less now  and the hair is great  i notice that while i still have damaged hair from the repaired old dryier  the half hair closer to the roots which is not damaged has remained healthy  keeping its natural waviness for when i decide to let it dry alone  br    br   the babyliss pro is powerful  fast  and easy to manage  it is a bit smaller in size than the other dryer i had  which is just fine for me  i feel that since the blower is so fast  i can avoid the heat fto touch my hair for so long  thus making a more healthier drying experience for my hair everytime  for your info  i use all the buttons at full speed always  i can have my hair ready in 35 40 minutes ds  but i have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage  grrr    br    br   then i decided to get myself a nice  professional hair drier  and

in 35 40 minutes  great heating appliance   works great and dries hair quickly   if you fall asleep under the dryer don t worry the timer will wake you up  works great   i wish the bonnet was larger love this blow dryer   i have naturally curly hair and it often gets frizzy after i blow dry it but i can see a difference when i used this hair dryer   not perfect but definitely better   someone mentioned how quiet it is and i absolutely agree   the first time i used it my husband commented on how quiet that hair dryer was   great blow dryer   try it you will like it  i love it  i bought one for my daughter also  i have the full size t3  and i am very happy i purchased this travel size  it really does work to keep your hair less frizzy  and dries really quickly  the folding mechanism works well  so it fits nicely in my carry on bag  i love the idea of not having to use the dryer in the hotel room  love this dryer  i have two    one ant home and one at the lake place  works great i absolutely love this dryer  it has simplified my hair routine and save on so much time  i would definitely recommend this  love love love  this is the best hair dryer i ve ever seen  it s really light  very quiet  and dispenses a small burst of cool air from above the nuzzle  which is unexpectedly brilliant  it also folds so it doesn t take too much space in my luggage when i travel  the chord is a bit too short  but with an extension is fine  this hairdryer makes my hair look fabulous  i didn t think that it would make much difference  but it did   best hair dryer ever     i didnt care that much abt a hair dryer so most of time my hair was fuzzy  this hair dryer really works with its function choices  so far so good   the dryer is very lightweight  which i love   love the pink too   the price was right as well     all around a good purchase  best hairdryer  ever   love it  for the price and  size of item works ok  the best      small but powerful  dual voltage  great for travel  easy to pack  very light  so much easierr to work with  than the larger  heavy ones  used this at one of top brand name hotel  like it very much  air volume is good with reasonable noise  excellent product  so hot i couldn   use it except to thaw ice in my freezer  this dryer did not blow with much power  i returned it  works well but both of us frequently turn of the hair dryer by accident because of knob placement   excellent first  introduced to this product at several 5 star hotels and figured it must be durable and it is   one has lasted 5  years with near daily use  new one is for guests  have read a few negative reviews and figured customers got a lemon  it happens  great blow dryer  great price and very light weight  i am very happy with the hair dryer so far  it works perfectly  my hair gets dry quickly and it is so easy to use  i mostly bought this hair dryer for my daughters  they have longer hair and it costs me so much money and time to bring them to the salon  so now i have my own salon at home  i couldn t be happier  it is so far so good  ordered 2  they work great  i love this dryer    salon worthy rollersets every time   gets nice and hot and drys my hair quickly  quite enough that you can hear the tv and have a conversation on the phone  fits my large head lol and purple and black rollers okay  its a tight fit but it does fit  tiny  lightweight  but packs a powerful punch  best dryer ever  time saver  and eliminates frizz  and changed my hair from   34 drab to fab  34      love love love    it s quiet   my hair dries quickly and with more volume than my previous dryer  i can t say anything bad about this product  excellent the hair dryer i purchased in june has burned up and has to be replaced  it was great while it was working and wife loved it but surely it should have lasted more than 3 1 2 months  this brand was recommended by my hair stylist   it is perfect to straighten hair  however  for soft curly hair such as mine  the heat is too strong even at   34 low  34  level   i have to use the old hair drying when diffusing my hair   my daughters  who happened to have   34 mixed  34  hair  love this hair drying because it straightens it fast and without drying it  for the price  a very good and flexible hair dryer  the retractable cord  the many levels of heat and volume add up to a very functional unit  air flow was not as strong as i d hoped it would be  i love  love  love this hairdryer   it dries my in half the time my old one did  and it doesn t get hot to the touch like my old hairdryer did  my only complaint is that it s heavier than i expected but not so heavy that it s unmaneuverable  great product  lives up to its promise  its been 2 months so far  br   love my hair after i use it   bought this for my wife before leaving on vacation  it works great  br    br   pros  br    light weight br    dries hair quickly br    folds up for easy packing in the luggage br    br   cons  br   cord not long enough for my wife to plug in and use while showering     this little hair dryer packs a punch  it s surprisingly strong for it s size   great purchase  very good product  i ve been using it for half a year  works good  love it  this conair product is my favorite  this is the best dryer  i have bought it as a back up for travel to the same br   model that i bought awhile back  it is a great dryer and functions a long time  my very first was purchased br    some years ago and did not die for many years of everyday use  i highly recommend it  glad i purchased 2 one for each bathroom they re great no more looking through drawers to find the hair dryer i works great and was a good price  infrequent user   second purchase of this model   first one lasted a few years until the cord didn t retract  and then something came loose and smelled chemically acrid  br    br   it moves air and dries fairly well   no particular change in frizz level compared to others  br    br   temps are spot on with me  it s nice to know i won t get burned nor be frustrated by a too cool warm  br    br   i ve gotten out of the habit of electric drying both for ecological reasons and for noise hearing damage   the only person really bothered by my wet hair or the results if nature dried is me   i don t find it any louder than any of my previous dryers  but my dd hates it with a passion  i m thinking about using it as punishment  not really  but i probably could    i don t get it  though  that s how hair dryers sound   she winced at a 1200w mini  too  br    br   my cord retracts just fine  not like a shade  but i m glad to have the heftier safer cord without a vicious  finger eating spring   it took hundreds of in and outs for my old one to give out  br    br   the switches could have benefited mightily with even a slightly a concave dragging surface   this strikes me as an efficiency design that wasn t   it s not intolerable  though  if it bothered me that much i d glop some plastic adhesive on it to give it a thumb knob or edges  br    br   i    60 3  love   60 3  the surface  it s totally lenovo  not cheap    it s  great   grippable  if you don t always use the handle  like when the handle is folded in    that said  it s not makeup friendly  or rather  it is   oily pigmented stuff shows up on this and can be hard to get really clean  90  rubbing alcohol does the trick   i still love it  br    br   my attachments stay on  tightly   save the rubber bands from your broccoli and wrap them around the dryer exhaust to increase its diameter   cram like heck the attachments onto the dryer   there are other solutions  too  like flexing the tabs with  a screwdriver   br    br   i d say skip this  frankly   go for one with easier switches and a lower decibel output    at a higher price  its really amazing  i tried lots of hair products to rescue my sensitive hair and nothing works better than this hair dryer  it was reviewed as being effective on high selection and not so much on low   that has proven true but the product meets my needs perfectly   it was delivered promptly and in excellent condition  awesome  hair dries faster and looks smooth and shiny   i took one star off is because of the cost   i even didn t mention to my hobby how much this thing cost  so great l love it   drys my hair so good and fast lm dominican l have curly thick hair   so lm very happy with my turbo not as powerful as described but better than most mini hair dryers  br   small and lightweight  it is an excellent hair dryer  this is the second one we have purchased  when the right order did come  it was perfect   bought two for guest bathroom and so far it s been perfect  lots of power in a little size this dryer is wonderful it is even better than i expected br   thanks love this hair dryer   i had brought one similar to it in june 2013   so far this one is performing well   i was aware of some of the defects that others had complained about   but so far so good   its a keeper  good but could have one option faster  but the rest work great for person how doesn t has a lot of hair  i have been using these dryers for quite a few years and i am fully satisfied with their performance and durability   my wife  who uses a fancy high power dryer has put hers aside and taking possession of mine  it is small  comfortable to use  dries well and it is quite dependable  you need nothing more  excellent  strong  light weight hair dryer for travel and every day  i love it   good one as expected   and my wife using it    she is happy to use it     i have used this blow dryer for about three years now and i love it  my daughter is constantly stealing it from me so i just purchased one for her birthday  would you believe that was her favorite gift  great little dryer  small  compacted  reliable and drys my hair  i dont think there is much more to say about this  i do use it everyday  this dryer is ok  you just have to turn the hose around to dry the top of your hair  i have had a hard time locking the hose on the bonnet  wicked cute   great delivery    works very well and a great size for the money  this hairdryer is hard to beat  i use it for other purposes than drying hair  it s easy to turn on  easy to adjust speed and heat settings  the cord is just the right length  the color is nice  it s just right  i can recommend this product  best blow drier i ve ever owned  light and powerful  the power button is actually 2 buttons side by side  one button controls the heat setting and the other controls the fan speed  i really like this feature because you can set it on low heat and the fan on high  great for the price dries my hair in half the time  love this dryer  i love this hair dryer  it really does leave my hair shiny and softer than my old one  only one speed hot burnt my ends had to get rid of it i ve had this hairdryer for years now and it works just as well as it did the day i bought it  high powered and hot  which creates the perfect blowout with or without a round brush  i really love this hair dryer  and i take it with me whenever i travel  br    br   update    2 years post review and it s still going strong  excellent product very good value for the price    she really likes it because of 2 speeds and 2 heat settings  impressed   at first i thought 1000 watt wouldn t do much  but this bonnet hood dryer packs a punch   i ve used it twice so far and love my results   this dryer will pay for itself after another 3 uses   so honestly  i feel like i got it for free as i don t have to go the salon to get my hair done   i m not saying i won t get my hair done professionally but this will definately keep my hair groomed until i do  br    br   love it  great dryer when it worked   i purchased this hair dryer in january 2014   only used it twice a week on the low heat setting up until now   yesterday while using the dryer on the low setting the motor speed suddenly became very low and the thermal switch inside kicked the heating element off   this is the second vidal sassoon of this kind i ve purchased   the first one lasted six years  clumsy apparatis   i wanted more mobility   like multitacking and this is not set up to run with the flow   hose waned to stay on box and i wanted it to travel with me   my own problem   it was meant to be stable does its job at a great price  it s also extremely light weight as well so i carry it in my carry on bag when i travel  i love this hair dryer  not only does it dry very well  but it is extremely light weight and perfect for travel  it s also not too loud  so it doesn t wake my roommate in the morning  so far it still working  i have purchased these for every bathroom   not only are they handy  you don t have to waste space in your drawer   the night light is also a gr8 feature for finding your way to the bathroom at night  i love this dryer  great power  excellent portable hair dryer with plenty of power  the dryer is excellent  exceeded my expectation  not the best blower in the world but great for under  15  high  which would be high heat and strongest blow  is more like a medium heat and medium blow  i wouldn t recommend this for someone who likes really hot dryers that blow very hard  however  for me as a man  its good enough to get my hair to stay back  got this for more than just drying hair  these are handy for drying winter gloves  boots and hats  i also use this to shrink electrical insulating tubing and window insulator kits  a heat gun gets too hot for other projects and this is about right  has a nice soft grippy feel in the hand too  blows allot of aire on high  i ve used a conair blackbird hairdryer for years and absolutely love it  my hair is coarse and it has the power to dry my hair without causing damage  great product nice little dryer  its great on the wall and has a lot of power  love this hair dryer  but the handle area turned pink within about 2 weeks of using it  i loved it but it did break after 8 months the blow dryer is awesome however the attachments fall off when trying to use  we had to bond the comb attachment to the unit n great for the price  i needed a slightly more powerful dryer for my thick hair but no complaints  work great and i m very satisfied great seller  fast shipping  br   great price and quality product loved the item will buy from this seller again very light   dries hair quickly without frizz  within nine months of purchase this hair dryer stopped working   overheats within minutes   i don t even dry my hair but a few times a month so this is not the best purchase  nice one      quiet and fairly light  dries nicely without scorching  the pink hue on the buttons and filter housing was a surprise  as it didn t really show up in the photo  but   hey  it s just a hair dryer  i have long hair  and for the price  it does a good job  the only drawback is that i feel the vibration more so than from other hair dryers  worth what it cost though  perfect  this is worth the money   don t waste your money on the cheap ones  spend a little extra and get one like this that is good for your hair  doesn t get very hot  take longer to dry hair easy mounting but very little power  i recommend you get one that has 1800 or more watts  i loved this dryer  it is super light  small and super powerful at the same time  it is very strong and drys very fast  excellent product  i completely recommend  powerful  well designed and worth the money  my elchim from the 90s finally died and it was like a death in the family   my hair  while i used a temporary hair dryer was atrocious with frizz and stray hairs everywhere   this elchim showed up and it was like a miracle   the hair dryer is just amazing   i read some of the reviews and there was a burning smell for the 1st and maybe 2nd time i used it  but never again   it leaves your hair silky smooth  br   oh and regarding the heaviness   don t judge a book by its cover   it is heavy until you use it   then magically the weight is distributed nicely   don t ask me how   some kudos go to the designers  i liked it when it worked  but now it doesn t have very much power  this little dryer is my favorite  had a hard hood dryer for over 10 year  yes it worked great  donated it to my neighbor   this software bonnet puts the heat in all the right areas of your head  light weight  go too the landry room and fold clothes while on my head  br   lol  yes i do plug it in there so far ok good  quickly dry hair i couldn t believe i had found such a great quality product for a great price  i was in the market for a new hair dryer but couldn t afford to spend an arm and a leg on a fancy blow dryer  i did a lot of shopping around and finally came across this one that even came with the attachments i was looking for  i bought it and was worried that for the price the product wouldn t be as described  i received it and it has 3 different heat settings and two different levels  it also came with the attachments which work great  this blow dryer is still going great a few months down the road  if you are in the market for a new hair dryer and want one that is functional i definitely recommend this product  i have had this dryer for almost 2 years   if i could give it 0 stars i would   today  a flame shot out from it and nearly caught my hair on fire   it was like a torch   this is so hazardous  i was excited to receive this blow dryer and be able to test it out  since i ve done allot of research for a good quality inexpensive blow dryer with enough settings   especially because i have fine hair  a blow dryer that doesn t get extremely hot was a priority  i absolutely love it   it s everything that i was looking for   i like the way it looks  only one con is   it s pretty heavy  i would recommend this item i love my hair     thank you really nice  10 19 2014 love it  small and extremely light weight but packs a good amount of power  very nice little hair dryer for the money  good reviews are what sold me  and i wasn t disappointed  i absolutely love this hairdryer  it looks like i came out of salon everytime  great product  great price  quiet  dries hair quickly a decent dryer for the price  however  i was expecting more air flow and quicker drying for 1875 watts  my previous conair dryer  which cost more than this one but was also 1875 watts  put out more air  still  for the price  this one gets the job done  works great  no shut off like others have said  well worth my money  good hair dryer with fair price  ok after too many drops it finally stop working  i am surprised it took so long  def  buying another one good awesome blow dryer   it works just like it says  i would recommend it to everyone  turned out to be an awesome product and delivery  use it everyday  i used an andis  hair dryer in a nice hotel in wichita  kansas   when i found one on amazon  i knew i had to have one   as usual  my order came quickly and i am loving this hair dryer   the smaller size plus the plug does better in my receptacle in the bathroom   it fits nicely in my drawer   it exceeds my expectations   i am loving it  great dryer  easy to put together  gets hot very fast enough power and easy to pack carry  i had purchased one of these hairdryers previously and  after a few years it died and i needed to replace it   it s a powerful little device   i specifically wanted on that i could mount to the bathroom cabinet for ease of use   i would definitely recommend this product   good product and good value  it s a great value for money  br   the hairdryer is very light  it doesn t heat up too much and works perfect  br   a little con is that it doesn t come with a diffuser  but for this price you can pass over it  this is exactly the hair dryer i wanted   light and comfortable enough to grip and operate with one hand while steadying a wet dog in the other   it produces the perfect temperature to dry doggy fur  and it s got an easy to use heat release button that s very handy if you worry you might be crisping your dog and want a moment of cooler air  i m sure it would be great for people  too  but i ve never tried it so can t comment on that  br    br   one bit of advice   the appliance comes with a safety feature on the cord   until certain steps are taken  the hair dryer won t work   don t try to figure it out on your own  just read the instructions that come in the box   once you ve followed them  you ll be able to turn on your appliance   it isn t necessary to do this every time  just the first time  and i m glad to have the extra safety feature  great item i will buy again folds  nice  for the small size it dries hair very well  fits in suitcase very well  the plug is a little bulky but very safe  good product  i ve used this for a few years now  and it has been flawless so far  i m hoping it will outlast my need for it  this is a wonderful addition to my home   this dryer really gets hot and it dries your hair evenly      good buy    excellent  so good  pretty good blow dryer  wish it had just a tad bit more power  but honestly  it s not bad   it s not some cheap hotel dryer  love this dryer   replaced my old sedu one that finally bit the dust   leaves hair shiny and silky   dries in half the time   use on my pet on low setting   they love it  fair power  considering the price price  it s a good quality product  good this hairdryer is not pink but more of a hot red  and it looks kind of a cheap plastic     however  this blow dries my hair pretty fast  so  it does what s required of it     i took one star off because it does seem louder than your average hair dryer  if you live in a house  that s probably not a big deal  but if your apt has thin walls    you might not want to blow dry your hair in the middle of the night     i really like the fact that the cord is retractable  word of caution  hang on to the plug when you hit the retraction button because it will fly all over the place  and if you re not careful  this can probably hit you in the face because it retracts very fast     lastly  a couple reviews have mentioned that this conair 1875 is heavier than most hair dryers  my old hair dryer must have been pretty heavy too then because i don t really notice it  either way  at least it ll give you a work out  i like this dryer   much easier on my hair and much better than higher heat dryers  i like it the cool button is a nice feature  best hair dryer ever and the price was perfect too amazing blow dryer  almost like a professional kind and for an amazing price  works pretty good   i just wish it was a little hotter  this is the best dryer i have ever owned  dries your hair so fast  my wife loves it    great blowdryer  lots of power  great  perfect for my recent trip to europe   the dual voltage made it easy to use while overseas and yet it is very powerful  excellent product i love the distribution of heat it gives  so much better than the bonnet i bought from sally s that you attach to your hand held blow dryer than seemed to push heat to only one main spot  this was worth the investment  best dryer i ve had  this is my second one   the first one i had just burned out after 17 years that i ve had it  cant ask for more the wife is happy  folds up to just the right size  the retractable cord is convenient  and it works very well without overdrying  i love it  fits my conair perfectly  works really well  this hair dryer is amazing  i have alot of thick frizzy hair and this blow dryer not only smoothed my ends it did it super fast  im so happy with my purchase its worth every penny  nice to have  the dryer right at hand loved it   just as i thought it would be like excellent this is a great hair dryer for traving  it fold up small and the cord retracts into the dryer at the push of a button  it drys my long  thick hair in record time  i couldn t ask for a better product  i love it is the best wanted a bowl diffuser to dry my curly hair and this is great at a good price   would recommend  love it   great hair dryer  it s kinda heavy it really dries my thick hair fast   the cold shot is nice and cool  good best hair dryer ever      this is an excellent dryer  could not ask for anything better  great hairdryer  timely delivery use every other day and after 3 yrs it is still going strong  high quality product  i liked this product but it didn t last very long  very good  fast shipping and works awesome  good product   still using it  light and easy to use   i m really glad i chose this dryer  had it for 2 months now    it s awesome  i ve been through so many hair dryers that advertised as  no frizz   lightweight   fast drying  and they weren t that great  finally i purchased this one  i was in need of a new one  my hot tools one just wouldn t turn on anymore one day   so i bought this one since it was inexpensive and had good reviews  and i m in love  it used to take me about 10 to 15 minutes to dry my hair  with this dryer its been only taking me 5 minutes at the most   i use the small nozzle   and i get no frizz  and it feels so nice  i used to have to use frizz products with past dryers  but not with this one  i seriously recommend buying this i m so excited to write my review for this one  i was doing research about the best hairdryers  because there are millions of them out there  br   this one is perfect   i have waist length  thick  wiry and wavy red hair that really enjoys frizzing and making my life unpleasant   finding hair products that work for me  is like my life s mission   this does get hot  i m not sure what might be wrong with the other reviewer s products  i think mine gets plenty hot   hot enough to dry it fast  without burning the mickey out of my scalp  and man does this thing have power  br   and  its quiet for how much fast air it can blow  br    br   i love this  it works great on my hair for volume  or diffusing  and even straightening   cuts my hair prep time in half   recommend  great value and the best diffuser  very pleased with quality of product  thank you  this is a really great hair dryer for the price  it s sturdy and the settings are awesome  i don t like to use a ton of heat when blow drying  so the medium warm setting is perfect  the best part is the low cool setting is actually cool  most dryers are just warm  on top of that you can hit the cold button for extra  love that  the air itself is pretty powerful  and it dries my hair pretty quickly  i have thick hair      the only reasons i gave it 4 stars and not 5  the cord is a little short  but fine for in front of the mirror   it is slightly heavy  but definitely sturdy   and i am used to hair dryers that can fold up  but i knew it didn t before i bought it      i actually liked it so much that i bought one for a friend  too  great value and works great delivery was very quick  the air on it is strong and perfect  very easy to switch the tops  great price for a three in one blow dryer  recommend  very good very good blow dryer for the price   i would definitely recommend  i ve used it at least 5 times in the 3 weeks since i bought it  arrived via fedex two days after i ordered it  very easy to assemble and operate  highly recommended styling tool  particularly for natural hair wearers  or at home hair style mavens  my friend in the military posted overseas swears by hers  offers high heat or cool temperatures  and has a built in timer  easy to move around as needed  would totally buy again  works fine  okay for traveling  i expected it to be quite a bit smaller  this is a full sized  professional sort of dryer    good in quality  easy to use  quick dry very good  light and very little noise  dual voltage dries your hair soon  i like it  i didn t review it for a couple months to see if it died early  but no  it s going strong  way loud  but really strong and i love how it folds up and fits into a little bag for my gym bag  me likey  great hair dryer  love the color works well i have very curly and voluminous hair and this dryer was my best investment  i usually dry my hair on high cold and it takes less than 10 minutes which saves me time and energy  i also use the dryer when i want to straighten my hair and it s amazing and dries my hair in rollers really fast  love this powerful hairdryer and the compact design is a bonus   it does not have heat settings but that s not a problem  great settings   3 heat settings  relatively quiet but a bit heavy  my wife loves it and if she is happy  i m happy     great dryer at a very reasonable price   has more than enough power to get the job done quickly and is very convenient by being always accessible   i would definitely recommend this to my friends and family  fantastic blowdryer  br   was looking for something that had some heat options and this fit the bill  br   it actually dries my super thick long hair quicker than my last one  br   i highly recommend this dryer  im in love   the best blow drier ever  i bought this to replace my ancient conair dryer  this one is much quieter and dries a lot quicker    edit   update 01 31 2017  i am still using this dryer and it still works great  love it excellent hair dryer   light weight  easy to use and compact   love it  this blow dryer was more annoying that useful   i purchased this an an emergency dryer and mine gave up on me  what a disappoinment  the buttons kept swiching on there own from hot to cold to warm from medium to high heat  just because the buttons are accidentally touched doesn t mean it should switch that easy  that alone did it for me  also my hair frizzed up almost immediately after drying my hair  on the other hand my mom used it and although she also complained about the buttons switching easily   her hair didn t frizz up my mine did  it stayed smooth  my old hair dryer died   i wanted something small and lightweight so my arm wouldn t get tired   this works great   dries my hair fine  i do have short hair though   i don t think i will ever use the diffuser and the other doohickey   very satisfied   i also like the pouch   nice for travel  the bad reviews of this product were pretty accurate but i didn t want to spend a lot on a new hair dryer   the attachments don t stay on  and the sliding controls for power and heat are so difficult to move i have to use a towel to get enough traction to turn my hair dryer on   the  high  temperature is extremely hot  which dries my hair very quickly  but i m not convinced it helps my hair look healthy  as my ends have started to look like straw since i started using this hair dryer  i wish i had invested in a better hair dryer  too large and bulky  nice  small compact blowdryer with alot of air flow  the buttons are touched to easily when holding it  also there should be 3 speeds on the air blowing  it s hard to believe this fair dryer really gas 1875 watts  it doesn t get hot at all you can hold it directly towards your scalp and it s only warm  definitely not worth the money  this is my favorite hair dryer and it s the third i ve owned  great hair dryer   nice size with great features   my daughters love it  excellent product works great   i ve had it a couple of months and still working fine   blows hard  gets hot   variable settings   long cord and relatively quiet  this hairdryer is very compact  great for travelling  and the best part is that it actually works despite its small size  plenty of pressure and heat to get the job done  the only downside is that it does not come with attachments like a diffuser  which i typically like to use  i first experienced this hairdryer when i was in cosmetology school  this is the dryers that came in our kits   i love it  it drys my hair so fast that after a good 7 years of me using it constantly on clients or myself and all throughout school it gave out on me so i found it here and it was worth the buy again   dry time is shorter and it has power  great wind  and does not hurt my hair that much   best blow dryer ever  very powerful  works great  dryers looks good its ok  but you need to spend some more time to get your hair dried  i absolutely love this hair dryer  i cant believe i waited so long to buy one  great for roller sets   my 2 1 2  34  rollers are almost too big  they barely fit   i think a 2  34  roller would be more comfortable  and deep conditioning treatment  i do one almost everytime i shampoo now its that easy  it is large and raising and lowering the bonnet is not easy but it only takes about 15 minutes for my hair to dry with a roller set at the setting on 60  you cant beat that  no more tugging and pulling on my fragile bleached hair to blow dry it   which takes me about a half a hour  i just sit and relax for 15 minutes and then touch the set up with a flat iron  i would buy this over again in a heart beat  really good product  i ordered this because i needed the come that it came with but as it turns out this blow dryer has blown my mind  it s fantastic    great especially for the price loved this hair dryer  did not make the bathroom hot   lasted 2 years  then it wouldn t turn on and had to replace very powerful and very warm air   i use it to dry my dog after a bath and the cord is just way t0o short compared to my last dryer  powerful and compact   what i was looking for  the wall mount is invaluable and the drying power is very adequate  not as powerful as i was hoping  but it installed easily  still using this after a year     love the retractable cord i like the hairdryer but feel the stand could be made of stronger material for better stabilization and  the shield that drops down over front of face is a bit br   uncomfortable   regardless  the hair dryer does a good job and am happy with it overall  top heavy so hard to move around but warms up quickly   gets really hot so u don t have to put the setting high simple and functional  great price  works well so far       i loved the remington iconic ceramic hair dryer  i love this product light  convenient and powerful works great and love the rewind  this hairdryer is the best  not very large and fits conveniently on the wall  right by the sink  my husband got the idea from a hotel room and it s one of the best purchases we ve ever made  my wife says it works great  i had to order it online  the one she had for several years was not performing like it did when she first purchased it  over five years ago    she would not buy a different type at a store  she would olny accept this one  i am glad i found it for her  awesome i loved it handy on wall great hairdryer  i ve added a diffuser  and it s great for my curly  and therefore frizz prone  hair  excellent this unit was exactly what we wanted with a very good price   we would recommend this if you re looking for a lightweight  portable dryer  none available  this product runs quieter than i d imagined and works absolutely great  highly recommended  i like the hair dryer  but have to get adjusted to the longer gun barrell   my other model had a smaller barrell and i held it closer to my head   this barrell is longer and i keep bumping my head if i am not paying attention to what i am doing   nice dryer for the price and works great   two temp s and two speeds  good arrived as expected  satisfied  warning  this dryer will catch on fire  i was excited about this dryer because it was cheap  included the accessories i needed and looked to be good quality from the description and reviews  but i guess not  i just received it today and tried it out this evening to dry my hair  started it out on low warm for a few minutes to make sure it worked properly  it was fine so i moved it up to high warm and continued  i used it for a minute before i heard crackling sounds from inside and looked in  the coils inside were turning red hot so i turned it off  about a minute later i turned it back on low to see if it was a fluke  the dryer started to hum quietly  not at the speed sound it was just at when working properly  and then caught on fire  smoke coming out of both ends  inside red hot and small flames  needless to say it is unusable and i will be returning for a refund  i had it less than 24 hours and literally one use and it is gone  do not buy  i was fooled by the good reviews  maybe i received a defective product but i will not be trying again  it is quiet and dries all our hair quickly and feels soft after   i was referred to this dryer by my sister and i love love it  br   i would recommend it to anyone that wants a light weight  quiet and very good dryer   cord is long so does not get tangled  always been a conair user and after my original conair blow dryer was torn up by the dog  which i had for 6 years  i chose this one to replace it   so far i m very happy with it  very strong and lightweight  i don t think it s any louder than a usual blow dryer but it s not quiet either  my only qualm is you can t change the temperature but not a big deal  this works very well for a travel blow dryer  it drys fast  good timer and temp control but it is not sturdy  it tilts everytime i use it  love this hair dryer   purchased the same model august 2013   it only lasted a year and a month before it started making a weird noise   ordered another one anyway   the problem with my new one is the straightening attachment won t fit   i m using it without it   seems to work out okay  worth the expense i am a professional and have tried many dryers  my personal one blew up so i got this one  it s not that great  be prepared to dry your hair for 30 minutes  happy female family with this  very happy with it  fits on the very skinny nozzle of my deva curl dryer  does a great job  the part of the diffuser that attaches to the dryer gradually gets wider so it will fit a variety of dryer nozzle widths  i don t think it will fit on very large  wide width  dryer nozzles though  i love it  powerful but quiet  great hair dryer   great  teen daughters love this hair dryer   takes up much less room in their bathroom than a full size dryer and is much quieter  works wonderful  love the attachments it came with  great  it is small and light but blow quickly  bought this a a gift for my wife  she loves it and loved how it shortens the drying time  wen my mother comes for a visit from out of town she loves it as well and would get it if she hadn t just recently bought a lower model  the wind is strong enough  bought this hair dryer about a year ago and it worked great until last week and smoke started coming out of the handle around the setting select dial   wouldn t have another due to this fire hazard   fortunately  i noticed the smoke right away and turned it off  great brush for getting in the gum line  bred ommended by my hygienist  i gave it a 2 just because it didn t fit in my blower  first off  i found this at a goodwill for 4 dollars brand new  the only thing that was missing was one of the attachments  which isn t really a big deal at all  br    br   my hair is very long  thick  and full of both spiral curls and waves that make it pretty hard to style naturally  br    br   this dryer is seriously amazing  it dryed my hair so fast  i always put in renewing argon oil of morocco extra penetrating treatment from organix  about 5 dollars at walmart  before i blow dry my hair which leaves it smooth and soft  so i m not sure how the dryer would have done on it s own without it  but i am still blown away with how fast  efficient  and quiet this dryer is  seriously such a great find  br    br   my only complaint is that it is kind of bigger and while it s light when you re just holding it  it can make your wrist tired pretty fast if you have a lot of hair to dry  even so  i still highly recommend this dryer  i have thick polynesian hair so in my case  it doesn t give off enough blow power to get through my large mane  looks like a good idea though  very good product  i love the cool setting which i use to dry my hair in order to avoid applying excess heat to my hair  i use it on a daily basis and it works great  a gift to one of my daughters for christmas and she has been using it for almost a year every day and still works fine  this dryer is definitely lightweight like people have said   it feels really cheap   the one i ordered wouldn t get hot enough  certainly not as hot as most hair dryers with this wattage   and the heat would go off and back on while using it  took forever to dry my hair   i m sending it back  i use it every other day to dry my hair because i always wash hair at night  it is very useful to me  it has good quality and strong wind  and it looks pretty  i m only giving this dryer 2 stars because when it works  it is the best dryer   i like it because it generates good heat without the blow part being a hurricane  which allows for good control for drying and styling and i get compliments on my hair and how shiny it is   the huge disappointment in this dryer is that this is my second one  and in a year it broke the one before that same deal  lasted just under 2 years   a  150 dryer should last longer than that   i cleaned the filter as recommended  if it requires more than what i was doing then i guess the dryer is just too high maintenance for me   i just contacted the vendor i bought it through and i m hoping the manufacturer is going to replace it  otherwise i m done using these dryers  love this little blow dryer than has more power than my big expensive salon dryer   great for travel  i was looking for a good option for my curly hair and found it  great product  came in super fast i like the dryer because of the cord reel feature  i just wish it was not so loud  i have long wavy curly hair and i ve never owned a hair dryer  i always thought air drying was best for the health of my hair but lately my hair has gotten so gross and messy and frizzy that i almost considered giving myself a hair cut and just chopping off everything off a few times  i did start using a cleanser once a week and that helped somewhat but my hair was still just horrible  so instead of doing something drastic i decided to give blow drying a chance  i bought the babyliss 3 in 1 diffuser with it so i ve only ever used the two together  before i get into the results  my first two thoughts when opening the box was that 1  the black is a beautiful deep matte color and the pink is a lot nicer on the product then in the picture and 2  it s a lot lighter than i expected  everybody complained about how heavy it was  again  i ve never owned a hair dryer so maybe they re normally a lot lighter then this one  but from me  no complaints  br    br   and to the results    my hair is absolutely amazing now  sometimes i ll just look at my hair in the mirror or even when a perfect curl falls on my shoulder and i m just so happy  it s like it was styled and curled for hours to get it to look like that  it takes about 20 minutes to dry it completely and style it which sure beats the 4 hours it takes to air dry it  i put in some before products  lots of mousse and some gel and get to scrunching and by the end my hair is so full of volume and curls  and the best part is that my hair is still perfect for the next two days  sometimes i ll rewet my hair and diffuse it for about 5 minutes to add more curl to it but then i m good to go  br    br   i ve never used the blow dryer to straighten my hair yet but if and when i do i ll review that  but for now i m loving my curls   for mom and it works great  all i can say is   34 wow  34    what a quality product   i love it   it is so well made and works like a dream   i can now give myself the   34 straight out of the salon  34  hair   great purchase  as strong as a big dryer  this is my 2nd one  the old one still works great  and i ve had it 8 years  perfect for traveling  love this product  have had it for years and it still works great  drys my hair in no time at all  easy to tote around   small and light enough to keep in my gym bag  excellent  practical  very good product  has always been my favorite blow dryer   love it seems to be good so far   i have only had it for 1 week  good quality hair dryer with enough power to even satisfy my wife   you can feel the quality while using  it works great   live the retractable cord  great value  really like the 2 speeds powerful hair dryer for a travel model i don t care about any attachments that come with a blow dryer and toss them on arrival   manly men  like me for example  don t use blow dryers because that would be vain and  you know  unmanly   unless maybe the man lives in a really cold climate  let s say chicago for no reason in particular  and would risk forming an ice hair helmet if he left the house with it still damp   in that scenario i think it s probably okay so long as he uses a blow dryer that has the word man in its name and doesn t talk about it  ever  br    br   i give it four out of five stars  because it s okay for a guy to like a blow dryer  but unmanly for a guy to love one ive it four out of five stars  because it s okay for a guy to like a blow dryer  but probably not only unnatural  but more importantly  unmanly for a guy to love his blow dryer  amazing hair dryer    some of the attachments don t work all that great but the power of the dryer itself and the comb attachment make drying your hair as easy as brushing  this is an excellent product   very easy to use and just what i needed however after one use the brush attachment is starting to fall apart   despite this one issue this is an excellent product  awesome   best hairdryer i have ever had none available  this is a nice  lightweight hairdryer   use this one over my old one all the time now even though i specifically bought it for travel   like the feel of it in my hand  and puts out less heat than my other one   i recommend this dryer   does a great job on my short  thick hair and dries quickly  great  dryer for the money  i liked that it has a 3 heat  low  mid  high  settings  and great price  i just returned from 3 weeks in italy and france   this dual voltage hair dryer worked perfectly  great product these are super handy  just like a hotel at home  this does not mount close to wall  there is a quite large gap between hairdryer and wall  you can mount it with the provided bracket  or with a screw through the back  either way there is a gap that requires caulking  not a small gap  love the size  love the color  it even has a slow speed that gives off an appropriate amount of heat  haven t had a new hair dryer in many years and i just love this one   it s light enough for me to handle and yet strong enough to do the job   thank you  conair  the best one good price and product good  shiny and looks good  but also works the best    fast drying time and shine shine shine    great  relatively quiet  dries hair much faster than my previous dryer  working great so far  works really well  purchased as a replacement  good dryer  this is an amazing hair dryer   very quiet but powerful   it leaves my hair soft and silky   the best hair dryer i have ever owned  this is a great hair dryer  exactly what i was looking for   controls for both the temperature and fan speed  highly recommend  the dryer arrived as pictured      however  the cord is really long and hard to manage   it would be helpful to know this since a super lengthy cord could be challenging in a small bathroom       conair needs to shorten this cord by a good 12 inches  wife swears that there is magic in the ceramic    br    br   tells me all hyatt hotels have them in their rooms    br    br   what do i know  nice and compact  i actually love this hair dryer and would give it 5 starts but due to where the on off button is  right where my thumb warps around the handle  i keep accidentally shutting off the unit while i am using it  so for me there is a tiny design flaw  the dryers works quickly and leaves my hair shining and healthy  great dryer  but on off switch is difficult for arthritic fingers  very nice hair dryer  it s a little heavier than my old hair dryer but it has more features that i really like  i have very short hair that dries quickly and haven t noticed any difference in drying time  i really like that it truly has several drying options  the heat and the blower volume are truly separate so you can use cool  warm or hot heat with low or high blower volumes  and i love the cool temperature option  my head sweats a lot and it s wonderful to be able to blast my head with a cool high volume blast of air  it s really cool  not cold  but not warm either  i love this hair dryer  i had this one for  6 years before it finally gave out  i immediately replaced it with the same product  it s affordable  lasts and works great  i can blow dry my hair straight without using a brush  i love this item and i still have it today good running smooth i saw other reviews talk about it being super powerful   i don t find that  but it s quite adequate   it is heavy and big  but i m ok with it  and i m tiny   i don t see how a dryer can be not heavy if it has good vibration damping and noise muffling  which this does   i love the low noise level  as it is right by my ear  i ve had enough of the loud flimsy light dryers in the past   the only annoying thing is the buttons on the handle   i have to be very careful when i move it around my head  it s easy to touch the buttons and change the settings unintentionally   also the head is long  i have long hair too  and i m a tiny person   sometimes i grasp the blower part like pros do in salons  thank goodness for its low vibration   just that the beautiful silk finish gets oily from my hand that way   oh well  still a great dryer overall   i ve had it a year already  excellent product  the dryer works fine but i purchased it for a birthday gift and the front flap is cracked  i believed it happened during the shipping  it s been over a year since i bought this  it s working well  pretty good value  great my wife loves it  happy wife happy life    my wife says that is faster do her hair with this one  and i can tell lol bought thid for my girlfriend    she liked it love the  convenience it was great while it lasted   5 months  just stopped working  works great  have had it about a year  so nice to have it on the wall out of the way   easier than some to remove the lent sceen to clean  great hairdryer  great product  love it    i have long hair  that is about half way down my back   i ve never been a huge fan of blow dryers and used to just let my hair air dry   lately my hair is wavier than it used to be if i air dry it  so it doesn t look as nice  and i ve started blowing it dry most times i wash it   previously  i ve only purchased a couple of hair dryers  and i don t think i spent much money on them   i have been dealing with some flyaways lately too so when my previous blow dryer quit on me  i did a little research before buying a new one   i never anticipated spending this much money on a blow dryer   i mean  aren t they all the same   i soon learned that the answer is no  br    br   this is still a fairly new product  so there were not a lot of reviews to go by   i did research on what to look for in a hair dryer   it was pretty easy to decide that negative ions are a good thing when buying a hair dryer   tourmaline  ceramic  well  ok  but what about nanoe   it seems that panasonic is the only one using this technology right now   infuses 1000x more moisture into hair than typical ion hair dryers   i was definitely skeptical when i read that  br    br   i knew that i definitely wanted separate controls for speed and heat  and the panasonic eh na65 k has that   i was also hoping to find a hair dryer that came with a couple of attachments   the nozzle for my last hair dryer would come off sometime when i was using the hair dryer because it just slipped over the end of the dryer   the panasonic comes with 3 different attachments that snap into place and can be turned to whatever orientation you are looking for   they are nice attachments  br    br   as i said before  there were only a few reviews out there  but what was there was nothing but great reviews   what the heck  i decided to give it a try and i must say that i m very pleased   this hair dryer is quite a bit quieter than my previous one   i also really noticed how much i am used to the quietness of this the last time i got a hair cut and the salon used a regular dryer to dry my hair   it was way louder   this also dries my hair much quicker  which is really nice   with the amount of hair i have  it takes a while to dry   most of the time i am using the quick dry nozzle   i also found that i didn t need to brush my hair while using this hair dryer   i just dry it free style and my hair looks good and straight when i m done   as for the flyaways  it didn t completely solve that problem  but it does seem to make that better too  br    br   after using this hair dryer the first time  i thought my hair looked a little darker than normal  and figured that my mind must just be playing tricks on me since i know this is supposed to infuse moisture in my hair   the next day  one of my coworkers asked me if i did something different to my hair   i asked why they asked and they said my hair looked a little different color than normal   i have natural red hair and have never dyed my hair before   i couldn t believe it   i didn t tell anyone that i was getting a new hair dryer   that told me that what i noticed must have been true  br    br   to summarize  i am very happy with my new hair dryer   it hurt to spend this much money at first  but now i think it was well worth the cost   now i just wish that panasonic would come out with a travel size nanoe hair dryer   this hair dryer is a little larger than a regular one  due to the nanoe port on the top   between that and just the weight of it being a full size hair dryer  i don t really want to take it with me when i travel   i travel for business about once a month a really miss this hair dryer when i m gone  br    br   panasonic  please make a travel nanoe hair dryer  cord is to stiff  hard but it is fine for the price   the dryer works good  i have bought 4 of these over time and they are very handy for the bathroom   eliminate that struggle to locate a hair dryer  satisfied from the performance easy to install   makes for a great night light in the bathroom with the blue little led colored light strip  works fabulously love it  nice size now i need one with dual voltage for traveling overseas  great travel dryer    works very well not as hot or noisy as most  it takes longer to dry hair  took this one to europe and it worked great  make sure you switch it from 110 to 220 when you travel to a country with 220 voltage  my original own died after dropping it several times  loved this dryer so replaced it  gets hair dry fast and is not too loud  good dual voltage travel dryer  although a bit larger than expected  and a little weaker than an 1875 should be  imho  still   it works fine  this is my second purchase of this model hair dryer    the first one lasted about 15 years using two times a day   so  i was happy to find that they still make this model   very powerful and doesn t clutter  up the bathroom with the wall mount and the way the cord is attached   five  stars for sure       a powerful hair dryer that is not heavy and is quiet  gets my hair nice and smooth if i blow dry it straight  also love that it came with a diffuser for when i want to dry my hair curly  excellent product this has a lot of different drying options  cool to high heat   although it only goes from low to high on the speed  a medium speed would be great as the low is a little too low  very convenient and portable  this dryer has the perfect temperature settings and is long lasting  this blow dryer stopped heating up after 2 months   it only blows cool air now  i ve been using this little powerhouse since 2002 and just now on my third conair  it last s a long time and was thankful it was still around so i purchased two this time  just make sure you turn the air intake cap counterclock wise to clean out the lint that s caught on the grate or it becomes to hot  it get s very hot already but i ve never had one burn out like other brands  great item  it is amazing good   it  great  i like it i recommend this product   it s hot  powerful and will dry your hair quickly  it has great power and worked great on our travels to europe  love it chord works fine  switches loosen up  good price  quick delivery  great product  thank you   br    br   easy to use  light and attractive  love it  what a great price and it works great  used it in a hotel a few years ago and when my current drier died i got this one  even if this one doesn t last long i will probably buy it again  the power is great  i love it  this hair dryer is the best     i have very long hair and it dries my hair in minuets   it used to take me 20 minuets to dry my hair   now with this great dryer it only takes me minuets   this saved a lot of time in the morning   i can dry my bangs in seconds  they come out perfect every time  i was looking for something to travel with  that is why i was attracted to the fold down and retractable cord   i tested it and it seemed to work fine but it s too big for travel  even with the handle folded   the price was good so i may keep it as a back up to my regular hair dryer but now i need to look for a smaller one for my suitcase  this is so lightweight but ohh so powerful   great blower good hair dryer   a little heavy   my only real difficulty is that i had to make a conscious decision about how to hold it as i dried my hair   there is not much space between the 2 sets of controls for a good grip and i have to remember not to grasp it up high in the angled area or i press the   34 cool  34  setting and lose my heat  seems of good heating quality but only used once so far  arrived ahead of schedule from this sender good   hot  be careful   turn off the heat    before turn off the fan to cool it down before storing  long cord that easily retracts without whipping into things or your face  perfect for travel  although slightly bigger than some of the mini blowdryers it stays compact because of the retractably cord and folding handle  and you get all the power of a standard blow dryer and ionic technology great guest room gift perfect for international travel  works perfectly best blow dryer i have ever had  don t understand everyone s negative reviews about this dryer   it dries my hair in half the time my old dryer took  it is no louder than any other blow dryer i ve ever used  the controls are not difficult to use at all  you just push them upwards  for heavens sake    and the retractable cord retracts exactly as it should   the best thing is  even with all the positive things about the dryer  it didn t cost an arm and a leg like some i looked at     34 sticker  34  shock indeed   i love it  nice great product  quality shipping product is works as described  it is smaller in size than expected  but that is a good thing  all heat and speed settings work  would recommend  great hair dryer  transaction went smooth   would order again a little big than i think  but just ok i ordered my turbo on 9 10 14  received it on 9 13 14  was super excited   the blow dryer is dope  it cuts my time by half  couldn t be happier  works great  a fantastic blow dryer for the price  i too bought this hair dryer in november 2013 wanting something that would last longer but it quit working two weeks ago  love the hairdryer but i don t think it s worth the money if it doesn t last  it good with the cool wind it is very good and easy to use i love this   i  have average hair thickness  i love this drier  it s small and light and easy to manipulate   it has a good blow strength   its my second one   the first one lasted 5 years  but it was only  15 00  i am ok with that  i like it because it is easy to hold and manipulate in different directions to self  style  works great  little bit heavy works great  quiet  lightweight great product it is great  it came to my home with no damages and it has a good  price perfect  so far this works great  i read some complaints about it not being powerful enough  but that s to be expected with a quiet hair dryer  i live in a townhouse so i would prefer a quiet one over a powerful one  so it works great for me  it is also really convenient having it hang on the wall  hanging it up was a little annoying  primarily because a screwdriver that uses bits is too wide to fit in the holes  but once i borrowed a regular screwdriver from work it went okay  i would say the high on this dryer is a little more powerful than the low on a regular one  but it still only takes me about 3 4 minutes to dry my waist long thin hair  worth the money excellent hairdryer for the price this medium size dryer is great   it dries my medium length hair so fast it s a real time saver   it s rather quiet compared to all of the other dryers i ve owned  i used this dryer for the first time yesterday for my deep conditioning treatment and let me say  awesome  it distributes heat so evenly that when i took the cap off the conditioner penetrated really well  i love it  powerful little travel dryer   i actually used this in england as well as on my us vacations  perfect product  easy to install  great blowdryer  works as good as any i ve used before  looks great  lots of blow dryers are tacky and come in ugly colors  and also really heavy  this gets as hot and works as well as more expensive  heavier ones i ve seen  love that it s light weight and solid black  it s a great dryer and is drying my hair faster   i choose 2600 as i have fine hair and didn t feel i needed the 3200   the dryer is nice and quiet  but is a bit heavy not crazy heavy  i love it  br   i used this dryer when i stayed at the hyatt and decided to order one for myself ok like the color and the brush  never use the combs although they may be helpful  but not for my curly hair  wish it had more watts  but overall  like it a lot  i have been using this hair dryer for about a year now  no problems at all  it has traveled across the country 3 times and has never let me down  it works great and i like how the handle folds and cord retracts  i use it everyday  i have no complaints with this hair dryer and i love it  outstanding hair dryer   i love the retractable cord and the collapsible neck for storage purposes  works great very good product great hairdryer  options for speeds   options for heat settings   exactly what i wanted  and quieter than my last one  which was a bonus  and a fun red  sparkly color too  this dryer is the perfect combination of small size  power and quick drying   i purchased one several years ago and when it finally died i tried to replace it with a more expensive and larger one  but wasn t as happy with that one so i bought another one of these   is it perfect  no  but pretty close   i haven t had the problems that others have had   if it were redesigned i would suggest making the switch a bit easier to move and make the focus attachment stay in position more securely  it spins around too easily   love this dryer  good delivery  this blow dryer was amazing  for about 5 months  then it died  i m a stylist so it was very lightweight  which is important  and it got through the toughest hair  until the day it died  i have gone back to using my twin turbo  which is heavier  but the lifespan is way better  the hair dryer is inexpensive and is working very well  very good works great for me   i have limited space and really like how the cord retracts  it s been more than a year since i made this purchase  dropped it a few times  and the dryer works like new  excellent  i ordered this product and it took 10 days before i received it  i live in seattle and it was shipping from florida  that s probably why it seemed like forever waiting but i have no regrets   this hooded dryer is just amazing  i wonder what took me so long  my husband put it together as soon as i received and he did it so fast so am guessing assembling is easy   i was not there when he did it   i was washing my hair ready to try it out    the results  simply beautiful soft hair with curls from my rollers   i m excited at finally being able to do it myself and achieving salon results  you can move it around the house and you don t need a special chair  i used the middle  yellow settings and it dried my hair okay  the dryer is really quiet  unlike some that are so loud  i would highly recommend it  i needed a blow dryer this works perfectly haven t actually used this yet  it will be fine  love it works great   love this hairdryer  had another one i bought ten years ago that finally gave out  immediately purchased this and hung it right up  gives the luxury of a hotel right in my bathroom great job  works perfect   works wonders     i was mostly happy with this dryer  very lightweight and quiet  great heat  not as much wind and i can wear my finer hair longer  however  it died in the middle of drying my hair for work this am and it s nine months old  i ve had cheap hair dryers last for years  disappointed and now have to start over in search of a good dryer for my hair type  i love this hair dryer  after using so many wall hanging dryers while traveling when i saw this one on amazon it was mine    it s quieter than my expensive old dryer  i plan to put one in my 2 guest bathrooms  so simply to hang i did it myself   the night light is a nice feature  i ve seen some reviews that says the light is too bright  it s not  i m going to give family and friends this hair dryer for christmas presents  thanks again amazon i can find anything here and i love my prime membership my husband suggested  he has his own prime account  love it everything was great this does not have the power i thought it would have   its ok though  amazing product    i love it great dryer   fits in a small space   very convenient to use  love it  very good quality for the price   easy to assemble  the temperature levels are great dries quickly  silent makes no loud sounds except for the timer button when ready is very loud   over all a great dryer to have at home with salon quality   awesome blow dryer  and flash of cold heat  love the way my hair feels thanks amazon    nothing fancy  but great hair dryer  very good product for the price  i read other reviews that said this herstyler pro tourmaline hair dryer was very heavy  one even called it a brick  i don t find it to be very heavy  it did have a strong plastic kind of smell  but it has faded away  i think it was just it being brand new  i also found this price to be amazing compare to retail  have noticed my hair being more healthy  i stopped using this 4 in 1 oil stuff because it over does it  it sure beats my old revlon blowout hairdryer  it also has made straightening my hair easier since this smooths out my hair  worth the money to own i made a great lady happy with the hair dryer  great value for low price  it s not too loud and has the power you expect from an 1875 watt dryer  too loud        like an airplane taking off  i love this little dynamo   i bought it for travel and when my home dryer broke i used this little wonder   it works better and faster than any dryer i ve ever used  excellent i love this hair dryer  i bought it 4 years or so ago and just recently bought another one because i am living between 2 cities and wanted one in each of my bathrooms  love it   only have one problem   bonnet isn t large enough   for most people it would work great but i use very large rollers and the fit is tight  but it dries so fast and is very compact   great for traveling  great price of course but my wife had one of these for 8 years and it finally went craps  this was its replacment and i will say it s pretty cheaply made  hoping it will last as long as the other  works great  very compact  love this hair dryer  heats up nicely  light weight can sit anywhere comfortably  works like a charm  i definitely recommend this particular hair dryer to any one  the bonnet is very large  durable and adjustable  will probably never purchase the hard hair dryer again  it has a  compartment for the bonnet and the power cord  real easy to use  excellent product  very compact  compact and powerful   just what i was looking for  i love it  after using it my hair is silky as if i use flat iron it  it really straighten my hair out    my mother used this in a hilton and loved it so she came home and asked me to purchase it for her   small and convenient  great for traveling  dog hates it but it works great plus it s cute great for travel  i receive it well thanks mounted in master bath  easy access makes drying hair a snap also added dryers in guest bathrooms  can t tell you how much loved this dryer   for 2 weeks  the first one i bought burnt out on me in less than a week  shipped it back and gave it another try  i ve not had my replacement one for 5 weeks and now the cool button is stuck  sending this one back too  don t buy     best little hair dryer i ve ever owned great product  i love it  great for my small hands  love it i highly recommend this product because it does br   work great  i am very happy with the wall mounted hair dryer   night light is also very nice great   little dryer for africa  great convenience and space saver  perfect  has everything i need  it does just what it says now that s what i call   34 spending your money wisely  34  i ve had it for nearly 2 months now and it works just fine  good price for the quality and brand  great for personal use and for one person using daily  it s got a more quiet engine but still dries fast and i love the retractable cord  i recommend dryers like this though for households where it is only being used once or twice daily  because the engines aren t super powerful for professional use and the retractable cord does have a shelf life  of course i ve had my dryer for months now and it s all working great still  but if you have daughters or someone sharing it and they aren t careful when using it  or just using it too much  it will break eventually  also  great tip for using the retractable cord  always pull the cord down at a casual pace  don t just yank it  also  when pressing the button for it to go back in  what i do is grab the plugin and hold it really close to wear the retractable entry is and then hold down the button  it keeps from the plugin slapping everything in the area  this is the best  fastest hair dryer i ve ever used  unbelievable  used it in a marriott a month ago  ordered on line and i m thrilled  no comparison to any other hand hair dryer  works great   no complaints bought this because i wanted a retracting cord  and so many reviews raved about the dryer itself   after using it for a few weeks  i can say the drier is fine but br   1  3 speeds with 1 temp each  you can t go medium heat  high speed  for example   it s low low  med med  or high high br   2  the cord doesn t fully retract  even with some jiggling   it retracts enough for my purposes  i leave it plugged in under my sink  and drop the unit in a basket  br   3  it s kind of noisy  but does dry hair fast so overall exposure is probably less very good air flow and nice having separate control of heat and fan speed   a little large and a little heavy compared to others i have had  great product just amazing  easy set up  and it is just absolutely just amazing it gets very hot three seting  and its quite   i was using it one day and my husband came in from work and said   34  why are you just sitting under that aren t you goning  to turn it on  34  great hairdryer it is so light and works so well   this is my second one the first one quit working because i wrapped the cord around the dryer and broke the wires at the end that goes into the dryer   my own fault and i am being very careful not to make the same mistake again   lost without it while i waited to get the replacement  great settings for low and high heat and slow and fast speeds plus the cool button  you really can t go wrong with this hair dryer  i am now on my third dryer and the same thing happened to this one the cord broke just past the reinforced cord portion  i will continue to purchase this hair dryer because of all of the other features because it is so light weight and the heat and drying speed controls  just wish the cord would stop breaking   i was care not to twist it around the dryer this time but it still broke  i am happy with the andis 30975 hd 10l   the night light is very bright but i close the door to the bathroom and it doesn t bother us when we are sleeping  it looks like it wasn t original i bought this hairdryer for an upcoming trip and wanted something compact yet efficient   after several uses  the cord stopped retracting all the way  and instead  only goes in about 2 3 of the total length   i expected this to happen eventually although i was hoping that it would be later rather than sooner   so now i have a hairdryer that still folds but only retracts most of the cord  leaving about 1 3 hanging out   other than the cord retraction issue  it is a great hairdryer  it was exactly what i thought it would be  it is tremendously quiet and dries on a   34 medium  34  setting  the highest temperature option is too hot  when you sit to dry your hair  an office chair won t do  you must use a simple chair not too elaborate not to interfere with the foot of the stand  i am happy with it  i like the hair dryer it dries my hair pretty quickly but never burns  the concentrator works well which is very important to me as this attachment is the key to straight and smooth hair  the only negative is the placement of the control buttons  the on off button and temperate button are in opposite order of all my previous hair dryers so it takes getting use to  i have had this dryer for one month now and it is performing beautifully   it dries my hair faster than my other dryer and it is much quieter even though they both have 1875 watts of power   only con is its length   just a little too long to fit in my overnight carrier   otherwise i would rate it with 5 stars  i absolutely love the settings on this thing  very adjustable and not as noisy as expected  on top of that it has a very beautiful color  and it also has heat settings for those days that you don t feel like damaging your hair  very good  great product for the price i use this dryer to help speed along my paintings  it works well for that purpose  i like the compact size  it is easy to store with my art supplies  i think i m on my third one of these   i keep buying the same one because it fits my hand perfectly and the buttons are placed such that it s very easy for me to adjust them while drying   it s also light   dries fast  but as far as the   34 shine boosting  34    no dryer does that  you ve got to use the right hair products   for this price  don t expect it to last a lifetime   i get about three years out of it   if you want a dryer that lasts forever  i guess you can spend upwards of  150  200 for a professional one  like my hair dresser  but it s not worth it as far as i m concerned  great  8 31 2014 has anybody else had problem with the temperature   the temperature fluctuates from hot to warm or kind of cool all by itself   i feel like i have to wait for the temperature to get warmer and hope it stays that way for a while   is this normal   it can get frustrating   it has done this since i first bought the blow dryer   i m just wondering if that is what it s suppose to do   please get back with me   thank you  the best  40 br   i ever spent       satisfied really nice hair dryer   i love the cold setting and it is not a puny amount of air   does a nice job and is easy to use   not too clunky or loud   i like it  great product  top a little bulky but works really well  dries your hair really fast  perfect size and great performance  be sure and mount to wall with screws  i tried supplied sticky tape first and it fell off the wall within 3 days love my hair with this new dryer    we use this to dry off baby butt when doing a diaper change  i mounted it right next to the changing table  and it is flawless  easy to install  has it s own night light  and will even flip the switch to the off position when you re holster it when its on  great product  tiny and light  just right for carryon air travel  this is my second one  first one lasted for several years with daily use  can t live without it  i love it  love the retractable cord  my husband says it s too loud when he s still asleep in the next room  so i took away one star  good product   i ve used it for a long time  the hair dryer is lightweight and dries my hair quicker than my old one   the price was very reasonable  overall i am pleased with the performance although i have only had it for about six weeks   its durability remains a question  i have natural 4c hair  my hair is very thick and coarse  this dryer is the best ever  it straightens my hair quickly and very nicely  you cannot go wrong with this dryer  i love it  great for its price  there s no heat setting  but it gets the job done  br    br   however  i had some technical issues in the beginning  br   some metal shavings blew out when i first used it  i was scared to use it again b c i didn t want it getting in my eyes  but afterwards  it hasn t been a problem  dries hair  pretty cheap  but effective  i love love love this hair dryer     i m usually not a fan if conair products but being a professional cosmetologist i love it     my last silver bird was killed in a flood but my new one is in route     this dryer cuts my drying time in half and gets my curliest natural haired clients straight with no damage    their hair always turned it shiny and smooth that it amazed me and every client every time    i recommend this dryer to all who ask wonderful hair dryer      very utilitarian     easy to transport      a great idea replaced my old  20 years old  oster with new one   it works just as good   i have no br   regrets   great product good for about 6 months  then burn out  great hairdryer   used one for several days in a hotel in canada and liked it so much i ordered it when i got home   sort of rubberized handle makes it non slip  has 2 speeds for both heat and air flow  very lightweight so my arm does not get as tired  not as loud as so many others are  does a great job  i had this hair dryer for a couple of years and the plug went bad  so i tried replacing it with several different brands   i ended up returning every one i bought and then decided to look at amazon to see if it was even possible to buy the same model again   i was thrilled to find it and immediately bought it   for whatever reason the air does not get as hot as the original and the low setting is a little bit strong for a low setting   compared to the numerous brands i just tried this was still my favorite and am happy to have it  great product and fast shipping  right after i first encountered one of these units over 15 years ago in a california motel  i have bought and installed them in all three of our bathrooms   i have used competitive designs in other motels  but find that this one is still the best  and is reasonably durable   based on my experience  i would guess that a unit is good for about 3 000 uses  at a cost therefore of about 1 cent per use  not counting the cost of electricity    in addition to high  and low fan settings  it also has two power  heat  settings  1200 watts and 1500 watts  i prefer the higher one  the unit is shipped with the 1200 watt setting   in order to set it to 1500 watts  you must pry off the air intake cover to get to the hidden switch   you can also hide almost any length of excess power cord in the raceway on the back of the unit   you may need to experiment some and use some sharp u turns to get the length just right for your situation  you should also pry off the air intake cover and vacuum out the air intake grill at least once each month to maintain good air flow  and to avoid tripping the overheat thermal protector  i use the little lever on a fingernail clipper as a pry rod   it fits just right into the pry notch  i too liked the smaller and utilitarian design of the older model  but understand that most buyers prefer the ergonomic look of the new unit   when you stored the older unit into a mechanical clip  it gave you an audible click to let you know that it was firmly in  the newer model uses a magnetic mount  you don t have to jam it in  but you do need to make sure the magnet has taken hold before you pull away your hand  love this little dryer  i want one for my bathroom  using in my daughters bathroom but do plan to travel with it  good i got this to replace one just like it  because i love the hair dryer   the only reason i didn t give it 5 stars is that the first one i had only lasted about 2 years and i feel like it should have lasted longer   maybe this one will  purchased for fast and efficient drying capability  got it fast and have enjoyed it fast shipping from japan   excellent for my fine asian hair  works great works as described but not the strongest dryer we have had   good for the money but don t expect tons of heat  i bought it in may and it blew up in august   it was used gently on shoulder length hair for short period of time   up until the point when it stopped working it was a really good hair dryer   relatively quiet  high velocity  and effective  so far so good   light weight for my 87 yr old mom to hold   just hope it holds up  the product arrived and it is fine  we replaced an old one that broke when it was dropped   we like the new unit fine  this looks nice and is very convenient   i especially like the little hook for hanging the cord up out of the way   has a lot of power for a little dryer and looks very nice and compact in my bathroom   i would recommend this product  dries my hair in half the time   the attachments are great and the frizz is gone  perfect size and power  very good for my hear make shaun   funny  when you read a review  you might think     34 this is the perfect dryer  what i ve always been wanting   34   well  i m starting to think there s no significant difference between them   i ve tried several blow driers in a reasonable price range and am starting to think that i need to invest in a pricier one   this one does the job  is relatively strong and is not overly large   my hair is moderately long and straight   but   it seems often frizzy and unkept after drying  especially at the roots   i often have to use some product afterwards to reduce frizziness  br   overall  this dryer does the job and is a fair value  just not sure it s the one for me  amazing  ou can feel the change  make you hair perfect  at first i thought that the light would be a negative but it works great as a night like when we have to get up at night   and the dryer has more power than my old one so it doesn t take as long to dry my hair   thank you for your prompt service  this is a great product and having it hang on the wall frees up counter space and not more tangled cords  december 2015 review  br   well  despite what i wrote earlier  this blow dryer did not last as long as i d hoped it would  although i liked it when it worked  the handle became extremely hot while holding it longer than a minute  and then yesterday when i turned it on  it sounded like it was going to explode  i really wanted this to last so much longer  guess it s going in the electronic recycling bin  br    br   sept 2015 review  i ve had this dryer for a year now and it s held up amazingly  the attachment i use is still attached and works great  and has never fallen off  br   my only concern after a year is the handle gets extremely hot now and i have to set it down after a few minutes  i have thick  wavy hair so it takes a little time to dry  also  the handle  where my thumb holds the dryer  is starting the wear and there s a worn section  i m still using this dryer  despite the handle getting over heated  br    br   aug 2014 review  great dryer  good price  good overall  nice long cord  drys much faster than my last 2 dryers  i love all the attachments and the fact they don t fall off when you use them  i have very wavy hair and using a large round boar brush and now much easier to straighten  don t rely on all the reviews of   34 too heavy  34     34 buttons wrong location  34     34 too loud  34   etc    purchase and use  judge for yourself  you do have 30 days to return  although i will not be returning mine  great loved this hair dryer  but just after a year of use  it just stopped working  was really bummed  i bought this dryer for my wife n she loves it   she said it s not heavy at all n it s really powerful  not much for me to say since i don t use it    lol   i had to have one for my natural hair style  and it doesn t disappoint works just great   price is right  dries fast  i really like it  this product quit almost out of the box  returned it to amazon  the replacement has been working fine  04 16 2015 i spoke too soon  this one is just like the one before it  fan exploded in a dozen pieces  about 3 months out of warranty  i ve had it with this model and manufacturer  my wife does hair  she enjoy this i love this hairdryer  it is nice and quiet and easy to handle   so far so good  the most powerful hair dryer which i have ever used  it is a little heavy  but it is great for drying  all of my stylists use these  i actually ordered this for my sister  she lives in the houston area and has very thick  frizzy hair and all the hair dryers we tried locally really just didn t do the trick  this dryer is hot  but not to hot  and blows very strongly and allows her to dry her hair quickly before she gets too hot herself  good product  most people would call this a travel hair dryer   i don t travel  but i have short arms and don t like most hair dryers that have a long nozzle on the front   when my last dryer died  i couldn t find anything like it locally   i finally tried looking for andis online and was thrilled to find this   i hope it lasts as long as the last one did  wonderful product  fabulous to have on the wall   not noisy  who doesn t enjoy a product  as advertised  br   makes me feel like i m at a 5 star hotel   being pampered  best purchase ever    well worth the price    i have very thick hair and this cut my drying time by 30 minutes    good very nice  i travel for work a lot and many of the hotels where i stay provide the andis ionic ceramic hair dryer in the rooms   really like the results so i decided to order one for home   light weight  not too loud and easy on the hair   for the price  i highly recommend this dryer  it works much better than the last one  really professional dryer good  just hope it can be cheaper  after searching through many reviews  i chose this hairdryer   i didn t expect to see a difference   but i did   hair dries so much faster and my hair is definitely smoother   worth the price  after a bunch of reviews well read  i choose this hair dryer  i have to say its too powerful  that is a good thing i guess  for me it was kind of crazy to manage  i have short and thin hair  it dries my hair so fast and powerful that i have no time to make a style on it  br   it is dry already with no shape  br   maybe for a professional  with better manage of a drier will be perfect  i am still working on it  twin turbo 3200 is great   i bought it for home use   best blow dryer have ever bought and owned item came missing the connecting screw  still waiting for someone to get back to me  one more business day and i m going to request a refund and return  this is the hair dryer provided by my hotel and i was pleasantly surprised by how light weight it was and the ergonomic design made it completely comfortable to use  i use a tourmaline  200 dryer at home  it s too bulky to travel with  i promptly  checked amazon and found the hotel model for less than  15  it is powerful and extremely light weight and quickly dries my unruly  long thick hair  i got great results  even without a concentrator  highly recommend  nice product and a great price awesome    very powerful and compact  retractable cord is my favorite feature  this is the only brand i trust  i tried many many hairdryers  and they all stop working as soon as returning is not an option  this hairdryer is the last one you will ever need  it has two settings high low  and it just works  a couple months in and so far so go  br    br   pros  br    br     light and comfortable br     nice attachments br     no burning smells br     powerful enough br     long cable br    br   cons  br    br     not very portable br    br   the lightness can make it feel kind of cheap but i would rather it be light than unwieldy br     the blow dryer died after six months   it just completely stopped working  great value for the money  bought it for my wife   it dries her hair   i have used a few times to heat up some metal a bit when applying a protective coating   made sufficient heat   i say it would be just fine for your hair  item deliver as promised love the color good product  quick delivery excellent  i had a conair turbo bird that i bought back in 2004 that has something rattling inside of it so before it goes out on me i wanted to have a backup  the silverbird has delivered the same great results so far  i look forward to using it for another decade before i replace it  excellent product it has nine month working without problems  i recommend it great product   easy to use  quite stylish  and how important is that when one is blow drying their hair     dries hair quickly without any frizz   the cord even retracts   it has multiple heat and power settings   appears to have a long shelf life  unless you drop it   word to the wise   take care not to drop it on a hard floor   this is my second one  this hair dryer is fast  and compact  it has a high and low setting  and gets the job done effectively because it has such a strong blow  the only problem i had with it  is that the back end of it kept sucking in my hair  and it resulted in it giving off the smell of burning hair  and accompanied by it no longer working as well as it could  after 3 weeks of having it  the only reason why i gave it a 4 and not a three is because you and me both have the responsibility of keeping our hair away from the back end of the hair dryer  the reason why it does not have a 5 is because  although it is very strong  could not handle a few pieces of hair getting into the fan part  which is understandable  but still an engineering flaw  it s golden for travel  and great for short term usage  this dryer is full size and retractable folding  perfect  it doesn t get too warm  though it does include a button to push to stop the heating element from heating for a while  which normally is a good feature  br    br   had wanted a dryer to possibly do light duty as a heat gun too  but this model will get no where close to doing that   though  it does dry my hair eventually  just wish the output was better than slightly warm  updated sept 2015  br   this dryer died today after almost catching on fire   i sniffed a burning smell and 2 seconds heavy sparks came out and it died  i only used it twice a month to dry my dogs for about 30 minutes each time  always cleaned lint out of the air vent  very pricy to last just 13 months with limited use  does anyone make a quality product   br    br   his is a terrific dryer for the price here on amazon   it seems very well built and has a lot of power without being too loud  it has three heat settings and two power settings   i love it   great for blow drying my two dogs on a cooler setting  great   great color very string  it s my 2nd one  second because i lost 1st one due to my house burning  great dryer for someone with arthritis  very light weight yet powerful for its size  you will love this dryer   love it  easy to mount and dries hair very efficiently without counter clutter  great hair dryer  i have coarse  thick hair that retains water really well  this dryer has enough umph to do the job  great dryer     if you have hair  good quality for the price  i m an artist and i needed this to help dry my artwork  it works great for that  there s a low setting that i use if i have   34 puddles  34  in my watercolors  and a high setting if the painting is just soggy  br    br   i really don t use it as a hairdryer  so i couldn t tell you how well that works  haha  but it s super reliable  compact and i have literally never had any problems with it  maybe the cord could be longer in future designs  i don t think most people will take issue with that though  because typically there is a plugin right next to bathroom sinks in every house  for an artist though  having a longer cord would be handy  that said  i am totally happy with it the way that it is  i purchased this from mega deals store   it was broken upon opening the pkg   they sent me a new one   the motor burned out shortly thereafter   so they sent me a new one again  now about 1 5 years later  another motor has burned out  it s not like i even use it every day  i contacted them once again and they will not return my emails  br    br   i have had a t3 before that i purchased directly from the t3 website   it lasted 5  years with no problems  there s no way that the t3 i purchased from mega deals store is authentic  br    br   i gave them the benefit of the doubt twice  but i should have followed my instinct   if the price is too good to be true  it probably is  have had this for about a year and it is not only still going string  but is still in fantastic shape  this was a worthy purchase very quiet and strong hair dryer  so far so good    but the button sides feel poorly made   i have a feeling that s the first part to break  love this hair dryer  i stayed at a hotel that had an andis dryer in it  and immediately fell in love  it s very powerful  i use the low setting every day   and it dries my hair very quickly  i have thick  long hair  and it takes about 8 minutes  excellent great to find a compact hair dryer with this level of wattage  exactly what we were looking for  dries my hair fast   overall good hair dryer   i m not sure that it s worth the price  but i like it  great hairdryer for the price  it s not too loud  fairly lightweight  ergonomic  great colors  and my favorite part of all   the attachments actually stay on  i had another conair that i loved  except that the   34 concentrator  34  attachment would regularly fall off while i was drying my hair  and then it was burning hot  so i couldn t put it back on until after i was already finished drying  this one stays on and rotates securely  br    br   i can t pretend i notice a difference in my hair texture  it s always frizzy  especially in summer  and this didn t seem to cure that    but it works as well as my much more expensive hairdryers  i bought a professional one from a salon years ago  at a fraction of the price  the filter is also easy to clean and doesn t get gunked up easily  great product   thank you  this is my conair dryer   all of them lasted very well   i just love that it hangs up out of the way in the bathroom   hope they never quit making them  best hair dryer ever especially for the price  great  solved my problem of misplacing my hair dryer  i purchased this dryer because of the retractable cord  this feature is great  but    the dryer itself has really helped my hair  with three temperature settings and two speeds  i ve been able to minimize heat damage without increasing drying time  love it  love this blow dryer  it s a beast and my hair loves it  my hair is softer  i didn t realize how much i needed a new blow dryer until this  it s amazing  not as powerful as i would have liked   dislike the on off switch location  fast shipping  easy to assemble  even though the   34 directions  34  are just pictures  and works great  i have very short 3b hair and i only needed to use the dryer for 10 minutes to completely dry my hair and it looked great  excellent product  light  powerful  durable  we have bought several for our kids  very good  shipment took a while to get to its destination   i was expecting a professional mini dryer specially the air difussor    bummer   this is just like the ones that i could purchase in any department store  bought as a gift as well  but guess they liked it  powerful and not too loud perfect   br   temperature adjustments  blow dry option are completely satisfactory  br   color looked different in picture but   in real it looks very good  read all reviews and still bought this dryer  i think some people expect to much from a product so far this dryer is doing what i expected it to do  the retractable cord is working and the handle folds like it should and provides proper heat and cooling  none available  it works wery well but it is covered by a kind of rubber that glues dust and loose hair  the onei mk ii hair dryer is an excellent way to reduce frizz when drying while styling   i would totally recommend it to anyone looking for a great hair dryer  good gift for my wife   received quickly and just as described lots of power and is an excellent addition to our bathrooms  this delivers more blowing power than i have experienced before  which requires me to use the middle setting for my long  curly hair  my husband likes the high setting for a quick dry  perfect for both of our diverse needs  excellent my wife had used this at a hotel and liked it for its compactness and its heat setting and airflow   it is rather noisy  but it is light  have had this hair dryer for years and love it  gets nice and hot without burning me  speed is good  no complaints  love it  my tabletop dryer dried my hair in about an hour and 30 mins   this takes an hour to dry and is super quiet i  it is bulky and an eye sore in my bedroom   the old dryer folded and i stored in my closet   this is too big to fit in there   but i m glad i purchased it  great product   exactly what i was looking for  my favorite hairdryer   i have been using this for years  professional dryer this worked great  with the appropriate adaptor  when i used it in italy   in fact  it worked better than the one in the hotel bathroom that was made for use in europe  other than the pink trim  looks silver in photo   excellent dryer  solid feel and powerful  i like it very much     i like this brush  don t love it           i expected my medium fine hair to glide through the bristles but it can be a little difficult if you have product in your hair and are trying to blow dry it yourself  i am sure it works great if someone else is drying your hair       bought one for my daughter and my wife tried it once and so i had to order her one also   seems to be the best they have used and is a great company    works great  perfect for travel  the dryer dries my hair quickly and has a good length cord   my only disappointment is that the speed and heat settings are not separate i e they are controlled with one sliding switch  low speed low heat  high speed high heat   i was very pleased that even though i ordered 2 items separately on the same say  they both arrived as promised and in one box  absolutely loved it   ordered a second one  i liked it so well  good product  worked well  took to argentina for a month and it worked great   i actually like it better than my regular hair dryer   just follow the directions for dual voltage and you will have no problem   this does not come with an adaptor which i had to bring myself  it s great works good and was just what i needed for traveling good price   light weight   works good  great dryer for the money every time i switch setting or hit cool button the lights dim   that scares me  good drying power in a small  very packable dryer   delighted to find it here   bought one for my daughter as well  it is a cheap product  and will work  but it will definitely take time  especially if you have a lot of hair to go through  love this  i haven t actually used it on my hair yet but my poodles hair is very nice and frizz free      great to have for travel br   not super small but it is powerful fast shipping very good dryer  i ordered this hair dryer for my sister and wasn t sure it would be a good one  it seemed cheap but i ended liking it better than mine  which cost twice as much  it s very light weight and not very loud at all  since it isn t very loud  i didn t expect it to be very powerful but it dries my hair much faster than most hair dyers i ve used  we ve had it for over 6 months now and it s still working great  it s definitely a great hair dryer at a great price  they work great  have had this for 2 years now  paid  25 00 with free shipping and the dryer still going strong  very happy   this one replaced one exactly like it which the handle would no longer lock in place   the new one has an issue that you have to fight the cord to get it to retract   the dryer part of both work fine   the bells and whistles neither chime or whistle  great size but pretty loud its just like the picture and what was advertise     great product my granddaughter uses it every day to fix her beautiful red hair as she is a dye in the wool hello kitty fan  oh the dryer works perfectly  loved after a dizzying hour looking at hairdryers in the store aisle i finally bought this in favour of many higher priced models   why  it was the only one that had all of the features i wanted   i wanted ceramic ionic and lightweight and quiet   it is much lighter than all but one i picked up  a turquoise coloured model that looked too cheap despite the high price tag    i used it for the first time tonight   it is much quieter  and to all the reviewers who were confused about the reason for the lower decibels   its to protect the hearing of the user   not the family of  sorry    at first i thought the dryer was not strong enough but it is missing that crazy blast of undirected air that just throws your hair every which way but it is definitely a strong current and very hot  variable temp  i used it on medium which was plenty hot   i believe it is pro  can get hotter than my last model    also the cool shot is actually cool  most models give you slightly cooler   this one is definitely the   34 coolest  34    so far   im happy and was prepared to spend upwards of  100  serves its purpose  wish the heat came out with more force so i wouldn t have to stay under so long  i love this blow dryer i got it for 10 on amazon you cannot find this any cheaper matter fact the next cheapest was 20it works great was brand new came with everything and was on time recommendperfectly satisfied i like it thanks the hair dryer is good but the brush bristles are too soft  this is a great powerful hair dryer good hair dryer  especially for the price  i m super happy with this purchase  already bought 2  and might get another one   the price is right and it works really well  my wife wanted an   34 old fashioned  34  hair dryer so i bought her this one and she is a very happy camper  strong blow dryer  had the exact same one and after 7 years it started to spark inside so i decided it was time for another one   i use it several times a week and am hoping this one lasts just as long  very powerful dryer and in europe i only needed to use it on the low because it dried as if it was on high   i still use it at home and here i use the high setting   great dryer   my wife loves this great pick up buy this people as a guy  i didn t think i would have much use for a hair dryer  but since i m an adult now  self diagnosed  my barber said that i should upgrade my haircut and hair product  this now requires me to dry my hair out of the shower  for me  this hair dryer works fine  i just need a quick dry in the morning before i put in hair stuff  so it s just fine for that  if you are a lady  or guy  with a lot of hair  this might not be the dryer for you  it s not super powerful  even on high  and is overall pretty cheap  look at the price   it s nice if you just need something to get by and don t want to spend a lot of money  good quality for the price  great dryer  only reason i didn t give it 5 stars is because it is a bit heavy  i bought it for my girlfriend  we are angry with each other for now  or possible ex girlfriend  if you are reading this review too late  and i ve got to say that it s a very good hair dryer    she seems  at this moment  enjoy it    and she looks very happy with it    no complaints    great product    good price    100  recommended  this dryer super heats  smells like it is burning and gets so hot on the handle you cannot hold it  it is a fire hazard and should not be sold  br   someone is going to get hurt  since i cannot return it i will put it in the trash  it could burn your hair off or scar you for life  br   dont use it amazing for a small hair dryer   folds up nicely and is just as strong as an average hair dryer   has lasted about 6 months and feels just as solid and powerful as it did when i first got it  br    br   also has a safety gfci breaker on the plug  which is just more of a testament to quality  but can also save your life if you re using this somewhere that doesn t have one  works wonderfully  nice and hot and does the job  best feature for me is the cool setting not found on other hair dryers  in hot  humid weather  the cool setting allows me to dry my hair and not overheat while doing so  great machine   it gets extremely hot  but it s what i prefer  i have this dryer for a few years now and is still working great not the most powerful of hairdryers  but wall mount is so nice   if i need to dry my hair fast  i get a different dryer  love it   very gentle on your hair   no more heat damaged hair  in 5 to 10 minutes your hair is dry with curlers or without  works very well and i would recommend this product to a friend  it s ok  powerful  but the hot setting is too hot and you can t turn it down much  my wife is very happy with her new blow dryer as my first dryer  i find it very nice and efficient  it takes about 40 mins to thoroughly dry my hair  which holds alot of water  with rollers in  i also think that it leaves my hair soft    exceptional dryer   i love this hair dryer  br   it is quiet  really quiet for a powerful dryer   it s comfortable to use hold  br   i am really glad i chose this one   there is nothing negative for me to say  br   i am very happy with this purchase and highly recommend the ovente x3  great seller   shipped as promised   would definitely recommend  i use it to dry my hair 2x faster than with my old dryer  a lot of volume  love it  my granddaughter recommended this item and it works great  the only problem i had is on the very end the teeth of the comb messed up  had this for 6 months has been shorting out  pretty much from the beginning  i think it has a 30 day return policy    excellent product  works fine  recomended it is easy to use and dried hair fast  quick delivery  great price  excellent product  awesome hair dryer   dries my hair faster than other dryers i have used  i have the matching flat iron too  great products  the 3 speeds and 3 heat settings are nice  the  low was quiet to use  a bit   34 heavy  34  but like the 3 heat  not the best dryer for fine hair   will return it  dries faster than i expected  cools  off quickly with the side mount hanging   love the night light   just enough light  this is a great hair dryer with one major flaw from my standpoint  it does a great job of drying my thick  coarse and frizzy hair in a short period of time and without as much frizz as other hair dryers  even my previous conair  i was pleasantly surprised that it is quite lightweight  my major concern with it is that the finger control to turn it on and to high  low and off is very cheaply constructed and designed  my previous conair dryer was easy to maneuver with my thumb but this has been redesigned to look sleek but not have enough gripping surface  especially when you have hair produce on your hands  i often find myself using my opposite hand to try to nudge it upward and have almost broken the control off with my  short  fingernail in the process  i much preferred the lever control of my old dryer and will be interested in seeing how well this control stands the test of time  i bought this after trying a remington dryer at a friend s house   i was so impressed with the speed and fluffiness of my hair that i just had to have one   it was then that i learned that all hair dryers are not the same  br    br   this remington dryer dries my hair twice as fast as my old one and the attachment allows me to concentrate heat where i want it  so i don t get the frizzies  br    br   this is the professional version of my friend s dryer   it is noticeably heavier  and probably not necessary for a 2 person household   on the other hand  it will probably last forever  br    br   it s dark brown with light pink buttons  which is aesthetically pleasing  but had no real impact on my choosing this model  excellent purchase  materials are a little bit cheap  but it seems pretty solid in case it drops  does a great job drying but it is loud and heavy compared to what i m used to  i thought my old dryer was loud and wanted something quieter this time around  believe me when i say this is louder than most dryers  also  i thought the nozzle on it was long so i have to hold the dryer farther away than with my older dryer  it takes some getting used to  best hair dryer i have ever owned love the cool setting it makes my fine straight hair shiny and silky but still gives it volumn i dry it part way on the medium setting and finish with the cool it takes a little longer to dry but my hair looks amazing four stars only because for me the extra long cord is way longer than i need i can see where it would be useful to a lot of people though nice weight for anyone that has issues with arthritis or tendonitis like i do throw out your drug store hair dryers and make the investment you wont be sorry  great value and excels our expectations  convenient  priced right and a perfect addition to our bathroom  packs power for its size but the plastic gets very warm and seems like it could be a hazard after prolonged use  very nice and like the filter cover  best hairdryer i have ever had great backup hair dryer for my guest bathroom  this thing is great   i mounted it in our bathroom and my wife quit using her hair dryer at her make up station and starting using this one instead   the nightlight is a nice bonus feature   there are no heat settings   the default heat setting i would say is medium   it is not quiet  but i don t think it is louder than other hair dryers   i think it is a bit higher pitched probably from the compact design   nothing is removable so i don t think we ll be needing to replace any parts   i would buy another one if i needed one  i wasn t expecting too much from the price but i definitely got my money s worth  i had an old dryer and this was much lighter and more quiet  it also has dried my hair faster  even on the low heat setting  love the rubberized exterior which makes handling easier  great purchase and would recommend it to a friend  works great and dries my hair really fast  i have long  medium thickness hair and this does the trick  love the different heat settings and how it doesn t just have a cool button  but an actual cool setting  only thing is i wish this came with a diffuse attachment    great so far  no real complaints   works perfectly  this simple  inexpensive little gadget was perfect for travel  br   it did precisely what it was supposed to  despite some of the br   troublesome negative reviews   it stuck fast to several mirrors br   over the course of my trip and enabled me to style my hair br   easily   i used a fairly lightweight travel sized blower  baby liss  br   which it supported with ease  this hair dryer is awesome   br   i got it quick too   br   great seller   highly recommend    i really love everything about this hair dryer   it is fast  has lots of settings  and black with pink trim   it is a little heavy  but it works so well i don t care   i am thinking my old  cheaper hairdryers were too light and could not get the job done   this cost a little more  but i am totally happy with it   get one  this dryer was affordable and has held up very well  i use the flow narrowing attachment and even with daily use  i notice my hair is much smoother and shiner  and has less damage  than every before  i ve been using this dryer for over a year without a problem and really love it  br    br   edited to add  i have now been using this dryer for two years and it works just as well as when i first bought it  i would buy again if i needed to replace it  i also started using this as my main hair dryer  it works great  love it and recommend to use and have at home this is a great little hair dryer   it is the third one i have purchased   i use it at home as my regular hair dryer due to the light weight yet great power   i gave one to a family member for their guest bathroom and recently gave one to a friend for her guest bathroom  br    br   it is compact and  sturdy  light in weight yet powerful at 1600 watts   it has a low and a high setting   it is a very good size to pack for travel  and even has dual voltage  br    br   i really like this little hair dryer and recommend it  love this dryer perfect for travel and everyday use  excellent hair dryer  i was sceptical that a hair dryer could would be infused with argan oil  as the package claimed  but i could actually smell the oil the first time i used it and my hair looks like i just left the salon  it s a bit heavy and awkward to hold but it s definitely worth it  i would recommend this to a friend  totally great  love the heat settings and i can dry my hair with a light heat protectant without my hair drying out  i plan to buy another one in a few months just in case they raise the price  discontinue  change it or mine stops working  it is such a great dryer at a wonderful price  my daughter is a professional hair stylist and this was given to her as a gift  she said it is the best blow dryer she has used and people often ask where did she get them  the best for my family  best hair dryer i have had   i went out of my way to spend a long time looking at different reviews to find the most economical but high quality hair dryer i could find  this one seemed ok on price and the reviews looked good  all excited to finally used it  i turn it on and within 10 seconds it goes to this weird sounding low setting  i thought i must have switched it to low on accident until i double checked and i didn t  then it went back to the normal high setting but every time i tried pointing it towards my hair it would switch back to the low setting with in 5 10 seconds  it took me three times as long to blow dry my hair where it came out all nice and frizzy  even when using a round brush   the hot setting when it did decide to be hot  big reason i bought this  wasn t very hot either  which probably caused more frizz   this low quality defective hair dryer was not worth buying  so far so good  no complaints as such  the only hassle is the grey plastic knob which is used to increase the heat of the hot air which seems very fragile to work with  otherwise  no issues with the dryer  works good  easy operation and very simple  best christmas gift ever     strong power and can blow hair in 1 2 the time   absolutely love it    make my hair style look good all day good product  no cool button  the packaging was torn and taped back together  i am pretty sure i was given a returned item  i had a different model of this same brand and it lasted 7 years  i was very happy with it  i used this one four times and it stopped working  i can not find any help with returns or exchanges  this company seems like a scam  really handy to use  and the pink color makes my day    i had a hair dryer with a retractable cord back in the mid 80s and i ve been looking for a replacement to love as much as i loved that one ever since it died after 7 years of service  this is an excellent hair dryer that gives a good flow of air  i don t like a dryer that gets too hot  and i was pleased that even the high setting doesn t get so hot that i feel like it s trying to bake my hair rather than dry it  the low setting is great for setting my wavy hair during the final moments of drying  it has a good weight that is substantial without being cumbersome and a good sized grip  my hair is prone to static and this unit doesn t induce that unpleasant state  i had high expectations for the andis rc 2 ionic1875w ceramic hair dryer with folding handle and retractable cord and it didn t disappoint me  really like this dryer  good settings and it has a defusior for curly hair br      cheap  but powerful enough to get the job done  it is smaller than a regular sized hair dryer that most people use at home  but it is larger than those super compact travel hair dryers  however  i will be using this on my travels instead of those compact ones because of its power and multiple settings  totally not worth the money   nothing special about it  i liked it so much     the size is small and very good materials    i strongly advice any one who is looking for hair dryer to buy it five stars      compact and powerful works great  we actually used this in a hotel and loved it so much we wrote down exactly what it was and ordered one for home  very happy   and the price is great  i didn t even plug in the hairdryer and try it because it was way too heavy  there s no way i could hold this thing for more than 1 minute  very good unfortunately  i cannot give this item an accurate review   i did receive it timely   the item worked perfectly at home  however  when i arrived in ireland the first thing i did was to plug it in to see if it worked and i don t know what happened from that point   it seemed to lock into high speed and i could not move it so it blew out instantly   i had to throw it out right there and then   you have to use it on low speed but  i could not turn it off or move it to low speed   it started smoking and out it went   i m just grateful that nothing more serious happened  all women should have one  easy to carry on vacation or just for an overnight visit  works great    arrived in good condition this is exactly what i wanted   it is kind to my thinning hair  i m 65   and easy to handle   i love the retractable cord  its great this hair dryer has got great power  br   it takes me less time to blow out my hair now  love it  excellent hair dryer  the stores do not carry a compact folding retractable dryer like this one  this hairdryer is great for the price  very happy with it and would definitely recommend it   i purchased this for traveling  and like that it has both diffuser and concentrator attachments   i wish it had a cool setting but i can live without it for he price i paid  lthough i see it s come down in price a little bit which makes it a better value   the storage pouch is very handy to keep counters less cluttered   i checked out some mini hairdryers that cost up to 5 times as much  o way for something i may use 3 times in a year  br    br   i just wish t had a flat diffuser without the   34 teeth  34    i used to have that kind and prefer it  good   very good this thing is seriously tiny  so tiny but boy does it pack a punch  hot air and blows as much as any conventional sized blow dryer  i am so happy with this hairdryer i d recommend it to anyone  i love this powerful little dryer but the one drawback is the warm setting can only be used on low  excellent product  excellent product item ok   cord does not always retract as it is suppose to   but dryer works fine  working perfect  i guess i should say   34 mom loves it  34    met her needs perfectly  beware  it doesn t work on high when switched to 240 volts   i purchased this hair dryer to travel abroad   i tested it at home as soon as it arrived at 110 volts  us and i loved it   i was impressed at how powerful the high speed setting was for a travel hair dryer   since i was headed to europe i switched to 240 volts and put it inside my suitcase  once i arrived at my hotel i was very disappointed to find out  that once you switch to 240v you cannot flip the power switch to high  you must try to dry your hair on the low setting which is no better than the hotel hair dryer  at first i thought it was just bad luck and went to try out my daughter s dryer   i purchased two of these dryers since i was traveling with four teenage girls    their s did the same   you can verify this at home  just put it on 240v and try to switch it to high with the dryer unplugged  you ll see that the switch won t move   you can only go from off to low  if you are happy with the power at the low setting and your hotel doesn t provide a hair dryer  them this is better than nothing  otherwise don t even bother taking up space in your suit case to carry this dryer  you are better of just using the one the hotel provides  great   basic hair dryer but it does a great job and has all the connectors  worth the buy purchased to replace an older model that finally died   this is a great little unit and much nicer than it s predecessor  first purcahse with the seller  delivery to canada is about 2 5 weeks  and product is vry good  worse for the dollar spend  i bought this to replace the exact same one i had purchased 15 years ago  the old one just stopped working on the high setting  but still works on low  very handy  nice design with the night light feature  keeps the hair dryer out of the way  i was happy to find the exact same item   i got a good 15 years worth of use out of the old one  so i can t complain  this is a very nice compact  foldable  hand held dryer   there are two heat settings and the power is just perfect for my application which is simply to have an on hand portable dryer to dry clothes when i travel   i occasionally need to hand wash a few clothing items in hotels when out on the road and this is perfect for this mission  its not as good as the ones in the hair salons but it does the job  i have long curly hair and i m under the dryer for about 70 minutes  only negative is that its very loud  i get banished to another room when drying my hair as to not disturb the rest of my family  this is durable  gets very hot and has a great design  i love my hair dryer and the delivery was as stated  time frame   works great  so much more power and heat than my old blow dryer   not heavy at all  average weight probably   i love it    this is a much better hair dryer that i have ever used   it is light  and has several options to use   love the retractable cord   stores easily  awesome product  very user friendly and compact for traveling  my wife loves it  good dryer great product  works well and is fairly quiet  came with a diffuser  would recommend  this hair dryer is not as strong as i was hoping   it s ordinary   it was cheap enough so i won t bother returning it  the best hair drier i ve ever bought  it was recommended to me by my hairstylist  it s fast but gentle at the same time   just fab  everything i wanted  i mounted it in my motorhome and i love that i can remove it to take with me if i m using a public shower  just what i was looking for  good my hair stylist recently showed me how to get my wavy hair to be a bit more curly by finger styling my hair and then sitting under a hood dryer   i purchased this hair dryer and it worked faster and better than the salon dryer   i sit under it for about 4 minutes and my hair is dry enough to hold whatever style i give it   i have a lot of hair so having it dry this quickly is terrific   how nice it will be to have dry hair every morning this winter  br    br   the service was fast and the packaging was appropriate   a totally positive experience  bought this for my wife and she loves it   she says it works better than any other hair dryer she has ever owned   my wife is happy  so i am happy  nice my wife really loves this hair dryer  seems to dry her hair fast  way faster than the one we replaced  and all the various settings makes it great for other uses  like spot drying clothes  drying off the kid  etc    i bought this hair dryer as spare  you don t know when the old one will stop working  i didn t use it yet but i hope it will be good because i had good experience with remington products  love it   love it  great hair dryer  good weight  i have coarse wavy hair that takes a long time to dry  this hair dryer does a better than average job of drying my hair quickly love  love  love it  very cute and compact  in love with the color  i love this hair dryer  dries my hair fast  love this blow dyer i needed a new hairdryer   the report on this one was very accurate   it does a great job  is easy to use and dependable   i can also take it to shows and vacations buyer beware       i purchased this march 2014   originally gave it 5 stars review  however  in less than 4 months the fan in the unit broke into many pieces causing the dryer to almost catch fire   i reached out to the seller but received no response   i had purchased this one because i had had a wall mount similar that lasted for years   i have since ordered a conair from someone else  it works perfectly and i can take it everywhere in little space  love it the best product  love this bonnet dryer  so convenient and easy storage  very lightweight blow dryer  nothing fancy  works just fine  good hair dryer   nice weight  cord good length   i just had to get used to the button location  it took a while for me to be able to dry my hair without accidentally hitting the off button accidentally  very good  great dryer    easy to assemble  heats up quick  heat is adjustable  mobile  works like a charm    no complaints  the hair dryer is great and does the job just fine   it is lightweight and travels well  lacks essentiel qualities like adjustability of the height  temperature  gets very hot at the top of the head and not  enough at the sides  love that i don t have to drag the blow dryer out every morning   its there and ready when i need it  it s cheap  not that great  not professional but it will work for probably  a year or two   the buttons are not good because they are plastic sliders  and will probably break first   i notice no anti frizz with this versus what i had with a professional one that broke before  greatest tool for natural chicks was looking for a cheap  decent hair dryer for occasional guests  did quite a bit of research before settling on this one  it fits the bill  recommended  great for travel  although a tad heavy  but works like a full size dryer   i like the retractable cord  but it does take a bit of getting used to   if you pull away when you are drying your hair  it will partly retract  but it just takes getting used to your surroundings and pulling it out far enough to start with   no big deal   i am very impressed with this dryer  got it super fast  gets the job done  left my hair smooth and shiny   fast  smooth and easy   the wall mount saves time in the daily routine of drying hair   i should buy one for each bathroom  very good  light weight and efficient  loved the price and product    vender delivered by promised date and dryer works great  i would recommend  it is great for a travel blow dryer   powerful enough to get the job done  but because it does not put out as wide of a path of hot air as my big hair dryer it does not do the job quite as quickly and evenly as it   the color is a metallic purpley pink   i did receive the zebra bag and attachments with it too   if traveling internationally be sure to read and follow the instructions or you could fry it  this was a replacement  i had the same one since at least 2005  it is very light weight with lots of power  easy to use to style with  the dryer was easy to assemble  gets hot very quickly  and the cord is long enough for me to move around with ease  sometimes it does feel a little bit top heavy  but overall it s a great dryer  my work s locker room has the full sized dryer and i really liked it so i bought the travel version to take on a work trip   i received one where the straightening cone  aka concentrator  spun around on the dryer  making it impossible to blow out your hair   i returned it and got another one with the same issue   apparently  this is just a defect in the travel dryer   it is a nice size for travel but i would give up the extra space in my bag for a dryer that worked for what i wanted   if you only want to use the diffuser it would be fine for you  extremely happy with my purchase  great product and shipping was fast    best pro dryer ever  super long cord makes it  1 very quiet as advertised  a huge improvement over the last one my wife had that certainly was bad for her hearing   also produces good air speed and heat  both of which my wife was nervous about ahead of time  really love this   i used in a hotel and seen that it was really handy   got one for my spare bath   so when i have company they no longer have to pack as much stuff   trying to give company that hotel guess feel   very nice that it includes a night lite   no longer having to turn on the big light  blinding yourself at night   i would for sure recommend  perfect for the price   an ionic dryer should not cost  200 00 i ve used this style of dryer for decades  and this is my favorite model ever  it gets the job done quickly and efficiently  and it is kinder to my hair  to top it off  it is the most reasonably priced dryer i ve bought in many years  i bought an extra one  just in case  it most definitely is not this color or this size  but it s easy to travel with and it work  this is a great blow dryer  it does not overheat  the airflow is not as much as my others  however  it does dry your hair just as effectively  good this hair dryer works fine   i bought it for a trip to europe but the hotels and apartment we stayed in actually had very good hair dryers so i didn t need it after all   but i m glad i have it for when i go to europe again and there isn t a hair dryer available   it s very light and compact and fit into the suitcase nicely  i purchased this conair hair dryer several months ago  i have been very pleased with my purchase  my previous hair dryer was also a conair and i had used it for several years  there are a few improvements on the new dryer that the old one didn t have  and i am very happy to have them because they were things i didn t like about the old dryer  this dryer has a   34 cool  34  button  a feature i haven t had before and i wasn t sure if i even needed it  it does come in handy when finishing styling  holding your style in place there are two attachments  a flow director and a defuser  these attachments easily snap into place and are easy to remove  unlike the old attachments which were a struggle to get on and off  this dryer fulfills all my needs  thanks for the improvements conair  the dryer shipped quickly and was in good shape when delivered  fulfilled as promised by amazon  it works great  enjoy the retractable cord  arrived on time  perfect size  workded as expected  i should have paid attention to the negative reviews  br   the bonnet is adequate in size but the drawstring on the bonnet is so short that you can t expand the bonnet to a reasonable size to fit over curlers   the bonnet connection to the hose doesn t fit securely so it is a juggling act to get the too tight bonnet on without disconnecting from the hose  br   i will have to go shopping and find a dryer comparable to the hot tools unit that i have had for several yrs   the bonnet finally tore but i have had 8 yrs of good use and the dryer unit is still going strong   too bad we can t just buy the replacement bonnets  i purchased this hair dryer a month or so ago  so far  i like it a lot  it dries my hair fast and i have really thick hair  my hair is left silky and straight  it does get a little hot  but not too hot  id recommend it to anyone  it is a great price too  it s lightweight plastic and noisy  but they all seem to be more noisy  this is a great value for the price   it does the trick   i don t need anything fancy   it is simple   i just wanted something to dry my hair  great for travel  3mo  holding up strong and traveled to uk and back very well  cord sometimes does t retract all the way into dryer so u just need to play with it a bit then it stores completely  love the cord  not quite enough power  i find that the heat doesn t stay consistent love this dryer    bought it for work as a professional stylist and really love how quiet and light it is  awesome dryer at an incredible price   i tell everyone about it  best little travel dryer with plenty of power      love it  love it       conair rules     this has been a great tool   the temp control  tools  looks have all been as claimed from the site  very good vendor to deal with      very good product  i have a bad shoulder and this is great for traveling  it holds to the mirror really well with a small travel size dryer  not sure if it could hold a bigger dryer  excellent product  quick delivery great little travel hair dryer  very powerful for a little hair dyer works great and i love the retractable cord  quieter than most   dries quickly  the cord storage is great but does have issues once in awhile   never had one that didn t  my wife love it  it is a great product and has cut down the drying time from 30 mins to 12  great hair dryer at a great price  i rarely write reviews  but i am beginning to try to find time to go back and voice feedback on the items i use most in my household  i bought this to replace my old ionic 1875  which was on it s last legs from years of hard work  i am wishing that  i had bought a different dryer  the high setting is so strong  and the medium would take a while to heat up to hot if i just started there  i can deal with this  but what i hate is the  cool  touch button  which is supposed to hold your style and reduce frizzies  my last dryer did a great job with this feature  making my hair look smooth and shiny  but on this dryer  pushing this button is like going into a wind tunnel  why would the makers kick the cool setting up to super dooper strong like the high setting  it blows your style to prices after you have just spent the time to create it   i would have returned it if i could  but i bought it as back up in case my old one broke  and too late by the time i actually opened it and tried it out  thumbs down  very good for my granddaughter s thick course and natural  hair without putting a perm in it  great no frills hair dryer  perfect replacement for my old  burnt out hair dryer  impressive  i love it  i only used it one time  but it really dries fast  the timer is a plus  the temprature controller is a plus  best of all it is not noisey  i love the travel smart conair 1200 watt for traveling  it is small and packs easily  the wattage is easily changed for travel abroad  it actually had two speeds when i used it in europe  often hair dryers have two speeds in the states but when traveling abroad with the change in voltage they do not  i was very happy with the travel smart dryer and will use it each year when we travel abroad  i would highly recommend it for foreign travel  love this hairdryer  it s small  quiet  and quick to dry your hair  i haven t really used hairdryers in the past so i don t have much to compare it with but when i used my sister s for the first time  i knew i had to have one of my own  i also give it points for being sturdy since i m a super clumsy person and have dropped it on the floor a ridiculous amount of times without any resulting damage  i bought this to replace a 24 year old sunbeam 1200 that finally died  unpacked the new one and slid it onto the old mounting rack  same configuration as new one  and it was good to go  i expect this one to now outlast me  when i first reviewed this product in the winter of 2013 i was lukewarm about it   after a year plus of use  i need to amend that review and state that this is the best hair dryer i ve ever owned   the high speed setting is perfect for blow drying my short hair  and the ionic characteristic makes hair soft   thanks  and is  this hands free hair dryer is so useful i ordered 2 more for my sisters  its perfect to blow out my hair to give it a salon look without the hassle of trying to hold the hair dryer at the same time  i am grateful this was invented it makes life so easy   the first one broke down before i thought it should but i love the compactness on the wall and night light and the two speeds r just right for me   this is my second  great space saving idea  this dryer is literally the best hair dryer i have ever used  i watched youtube videos on the product before i purchased it and no one had anything bad to say about the item  i would highly recommend that anyone use this dryer you will find that it is well worth the price  i ve never styled my hair with a blow dryer  i always just dry   then flat iron  for many reasons  mainly i m not coordinated enough to use a round brush   hold a blow dryer  in my 20s i bought the round brush blow dryer  you know the all in one  lol   it worked okay but my hair was still frizzy  this blow dryer is amazing  even with me fighting the round brush in one hand   the dryer in the other  my hair is smooth   shiny  just like when i leave the salon  don t pass on this one ladies  worth every penny  i did notice a weird smell  i m hoping it was just the dryer components heating up for the first time  surprisingly it works more often than not  but the cups seem to come off the mirror wall a lot and have to be restuck  br   update   i had to take it down as it came down all too often     it didn t hold for any reason that i can fathom        love it love it love   i almost dropped  200 bucks on a blow dryer from the dry bar  but opted to save some   instead when my hair dresser told me about this one   i love the temp functions and it really does the job without totally damaging my hair   also  i seem to be able to blow dry my hair faster since the end of the blow dryer is smaller and air is really more concentrated  great  quiet  love it  bought 2 immediately  br    br   kelly in san antonio  tx it melted the first time i used it in europe despite being on the right setting  complete waste of money  good dryer worked fine  i had this dryer for about 2 years  only downside is that the timer knob broke and the dryer won t work with out it  i would purchase again tho  for the money it did serve it s purpose  best hair dryer i have ever  every had  at my age i have had several  br   my hairdresser said this is one of the closest to   34 professional  34  hair dryers  br   and it is the truth   great  great heat and quick drying  excellent quality and ergonomics  love the green light  good temperature and air flow  installed 2 of them  easy to install with wall mollys from local walmart as the ones that came with the unit were not suitable  i think this product is worth buying    great i am using the dryer in my vacation rental unit and it is a real winner for my renters  i have had a similar experience as many other reviewers  this hair dryer has worked for me for about a year now  however  i have always noticed it would spark while i was using it  i cleaned out the back where dust had collected thinking that this may be the problem  this did not stop any of the sparks  now  i have noticed that i ve smelled my own hair burning  besides all of these problems  this hair dryer is labeled as a   34 frizz control  34  dryer  that couldn t be any further from the truth  i have never had a hair dryer cause more frizz than this one  don t go for this cheap dryer  spend a little money and save your hair  i love this hairdryer  at home  i use a chi that i have had for about ten years  it still works perfectly but it is a beast  i was tired of using crummy hotel dryers and even the hand dryers at the gym so i started looking for a compact model and this really fits the bill at a great price  keeps my hair as smooth as my pricey chi and has a retractable cord plus a folding handle  good for the price  came back for the second one  i like this style of hair dryers  the cord does retract as it should but leaves a good 18 inches hanging  the dryer does not seem to blow very hot air compared to my previous dryer  the settings just seem to adjust the speed of the fan  i still manage to get my hair dry and perhaps the cooler temperature will prevent me from damaging my hair  great little dryer  i bought 2 to keep at relatives   houses for when guests   like me  visit them   i have  visited and used both dryers  doesn t fit with diffuser of twin turbo 2600  not a noticeable significant upgrade in power either form 2600  i love this hairdryer and the ease of having it on the wall right there to use hair dryer works great  easy to use  but it s heavy on the arm when carrying long  it has a button to choose the heat level 3  this machine better than i ve ever used  i like it  very underpowered dryer   it has a nice power black finish which is totally spoiled by pink control buttons and end surround ring   it might appeal to teens or tweens  but aesthetically unpleasing to an adult   i exchanged it the day i received it for a conair pro which is much better  excellent  loved it love it  no problems or criticisms whatsoever  br   but i m a guy  so my standards may be lower      br    br   not as strong forced a   34 wind  34  as my previous 20 year old blow dryer generated  but it still dries my thinning hair rapidly  and is not as noisy as my old dryer   it feels solid  not cheap  to handle  and has a nice gold color in person   it s good that there are three comb brush attachments  as i know they tend to break over the years  br    br     happy customer this blow dryer is perfect  recommended to me by my hair stylist after she used it on my hair  and i immediately purchased right after my hair appointment  dries my hair fast  allows you to change the speed and temperature  and also features a   34 cool shot  34  button  plus it comes with the awesome add on to attach to the end and direct air flow  came fast and exactly as described  plus the pink is super cute  it is a lighter pink than pictured than   but you won t be disappointed     good these do a good job of drying my wife s hair  and she happy with the product  i always buy conair hair dryers   this one is lightweight   i like the different settings of the dryer  for me it works great   i have very short hair and it is fine  but you would think my hair was thicker because of this dryer and the small round brush i use   extremely happy with this purchase  its not bad for the price great hair dryer     am so glad i purchased it    good value it s huge   it was described as more of a travel dryer  but it s way too big to put in a suitcase  and too expensive for quality  cheap looking plastic  ok i had one of these for     7  8  years and it finally died  as in sparks flew out of it   i ordered a newer version of the same dryer  very pleased with it  saw no reason to change  great price  sturdy  dries my thick shoulder length hair quickly   not a quiet device  but well worth it   hair feels smooth and shiny  not weighted down  i ve normally loved my elchim blowdryers  this one did not make the cut  i felt like it was smaller and less powerful than my usual blowdryers  if i could return it  i would  i like it  it dries my hair quickly  however  i have long  wavy hair  and it gets caught easily in the fan of the dryer  ouch   i wouldn t necessarily recommend this dryer for curly hair  even with the diffuser my hair gets pretty frizzy and falls flat  nice little blowdryer   we bought two  one for each bathroom   they get really hot on low setting  it gets the job done quickly and effectively  for an old man who has little hair left  great reel slowly stops working over time   6 months now since purchase and most of the cord will not retract  great hair dryer for the price   i have a lot of hair and it works well  wow  this works really well for the price  it gets rid of frizz and is really quiet if used on the low setting  which i use   i have curly and extremely frizzy hair  and this helped it get smoother while also giving it volume that i love  also  the price is pretty fantastic for what it does  it dries hair great  wish i would have paid attention that you can t adjust the heat  you can only turn it on low or high  best blowdryer ever not too long ago  i decided i d better be proactive about having a replacement for my current dryer since i m having to tap it on the sink to get it to   34 click  34  into the hot setting and start actually working   i was surprised at the great reviews for such an inexpensive dryer  so i took a shot and bought it  br    br   this will remain in my drawer as a back up dryer   it works well and is pretty quiet  but it just doesn t get hot enough or blow strongly enough to help me straighten my naturally curly but short hair   my current dryer gets my hair pretty straight and then i use a straightening iron in spots   i have to spend more time with the straightener with this blow dryer  br    br   if i were still wearing my hair longer and leaving it curly like i have in the past  i think this would be a 5 star dryer   i would want a less strong and hot air flow to prevent frizz  br    br   still a good dryer and the price can t be beat   i like having a back up dryer anyway  it is no fun when your hairdryer stops working suddenly and you ve got to be somewhere  works great a very good hair dryer for the money  i just wish it had a stronger blower as my hair takes longer to dry than with the older dryer  great product  great seller excellent works great  love it  it s more comfortable that the one one i previously had  easy to use  at least i can lay down  this was an inexpensive hair dryer and i was skeptical about it at first   it didn t seem to put out as much power as my last dryer which shorted out and blew a house fuse   however  it seems to dry just as quickly and is not as noisy as my last dryer   it s easy to handle and not too heavy   i have been happy with this product  perfect for my sunny powder room  good product  love it  dries my hair quickly  has lots of settings  the cord doesn t is long and doesn t tangle  easy to clean the back screen  and i love the cold shot button  yeah and i love that it s red   pretty   awesome dryer  great product that i have searched for many years    good power   dual voltage i loved the idea that you could switch the voltage  however  you only get the low speed  i have a lot of hair so it took forever to blow dry my hair  on a positive note  it is small and fits well into a carryon  dry hair very fast  i love it  i love love love this hair dryer    wash my hair seat for 30 min nd i m done    i had to find this model on amazon because my local targets weren t selling this model anymore  my puppy chewed up my first one  and bought another type at target  but it was so loud  and i took it back  i m happy that i found this for sale on amazon because it s quiet as far as blow dryers go  and i love the retractable cord  as long as they make this particular model  that will be my first choice if something happens to my new one  very powerful and light hair dryer it works well  you just have to find a right chair and a surface with the right height so you would not have a sore neck from the use of it  good bang for the buck   works fine  i think the product is  fine  but i guess i didn t really think it out   it is stationary  so if the dryer isn t moving  you are moving   your head all around   to hit the hot air   plus  you can t mount it on the mirror because with the vanity there  its too far away   you gotta put it on the wall right next to your head and move all around   i guess i thought i could put on my face while blow drying  but that s not the case at all  i bought this to replace the exact same model that i had for over five years  it is good but not as great as the former model which seem to have a tad more power  needed to dry extremely thick hair  and had a free spinning collar for the cord at the base which kept the cord from getting that spiral twist kinks  it was a great dryer  now downsized to good status  the sound is good  no irritating high pitch  which has been reason for me to return several dryers i have purchased in the past  despite the loss of a star  it is still the best dryer on the market for thick course hair that seems to take forever to dry  so far so good  i like that there are multiple settings  high and heat are not necessarily on at the same time  you can adjust to many different settings  the cool blast button is also a great touch  great product for the price  i went on a trip where i wasn t sure there would be hair dryers   this one did a good job to dry my hair on the go  great blowdryer  but the cap to put on the front part of the dryer  kept falling off from putting it down and up in my sink  while blowdrying my hair  i fixed this by gently putting it on a flat surface  resting it on the red circle grip  sucks i have to do this  but it is best blowdryer i ever owned very powerful hair dryer  br    br   the warm setting is almost hot  while the hot setting is nice and toasty    br   the cool shot immediately takes effect  that s nice  br    br   it came with a couple of accessories to attach to the front  but haven t been able to try them out  br    br   construction seems solid  the wire was thick and insulated  br    br   can t beat it for a  10 dryer  it s nice  i usually use it for deep conditions or if i m doing dreads on someone else i will put them under when i m done re twisting  it s handy to have in the house for situations like that  i ve never had issues with it and i ve had it about 5 months  i wish i had time to use it for different styles on myself but i m sure it would work for a plethora of different things  works perfect and cant beat the price  i bought this for my sister  to replace her ancient conair hair dryer  she has super thick long hair and the old one did her well for years and years  so when it finally died  it only seemed natural to ty and find one by the same brand  well  she loves this thing  it is super light and powerful  the diffuser makes all the difference in the world  don t be afraid to buy this  you will be happy this item works well  seems sturdy  is attractive  and was priced right   hopefully  it will last  this small compact dryer is so perfect for my wash and go hair do and does just what i want it to do to my hair   i really love it and get my hair done in less than five minutes  i m sure the cut has a lot to do with it as well  so they go hand in hand  love this dryer works great on drying my dread locks at the base  i have owned this dryer for nearly 5 yrs and it works the same as when i first received it  the heat distribution is not even as other reviewers have mentioned however i like that because it drys my scalp and roots without drying out the rest of my lock  it also works great for when i want to do a hot oil treatment or deep condition  i just throw on a shower cap put the heat on low and i am good to go w o having to spend another 20 30 bux at the salon or waste water steaming up the bathroom  while i did have straight hair when i first received this as a gift i did not find it as convenient to use because my hair was so thin it would literally feel like it was burning my scalp  when i had my afro it was a  perfect drying tool  i needed a dryer with a very long cord and this one fit the bill perfectly   light weight  powerful and easy to use  was skeptical of buying a hair dryer this cheap  definitely didn t think the ionic conditioning part would work but it does  i have weird fuzzy hair that has terribly fly aways  it never dries smooth  but this dryer does the very best  i can actually go out without straightening my hair now  yay like being able to hang the dryer on wall or cabinet so it is easy to use  does not take up space on counter or in drawer  i received my product with great tracking from amazon  i felt confident when ordering the brand name because i figured they had years of experience with these products  i purchased this item new in the box and i have had wall mount dryers before and are an easy install   conair s metal wall mount holes in the plate were too small for the screws given  there was no way to screw them into the plate to attach to the wall   i had to search my garage for self tapping metal screws to match the hole size and finally after a good hour or so was able to attach the wall plate that holds the dryer  once i unpacked the dryer and hung it on the wall plate  i noticed the dust cover on the back of the dryer looked loose  after inspecting the problem  i found that one of the prongs that hold it to the dryer was missing  to add to all the existing problems the grip that hold the hair dryer handle was so loos that it hardly held the hair dryer in place when it is sitting back in the cradle  br   i called conair customer service to see what they could do for me and i was told they have no parts for this hair dryer  i would need to contact amazon to return or replace   what a complete waste of time not to mention i threw my old hair dryer out  i will not be purchasing another conair wall mount dryer in the future  i only blow dry my hair straight about once a week   although i liked the blowdryer  i ve had blowdryers last years   i went through 2 in 2 years   so   not so good  good product  good price fast delivery exactly what i expected  would purchase from this seller again  built better than i had expected and well thought out  makes the age old problem of hair dryer storage and cord tangle fade away  looks good on the wall and has enough cord to mount just about anywhere in a normal bathroom  this is a great dryer   i have been using it almost daily for a little over a year now and it is still like new   it is easy to clean the intake screen and the cord and housing still look like new   i have dropped this dryer several times with no problems what so every   a great dryer for the whole family  arrived quickly and works great  i got tired of cheaper hair dryers burning out on me  so i bought this hair dryer in february 2009   over 5 years ago   i use it every day and it s still working great  br    br   the switches for off low high and low medium high heat are on the handle of the hair dryer  and yet luckily i don t accidentally hit the switches when i m holding it  br    br   this isn t lightweight and it takes up room when traveling  but i still insist on bringing this with me on trips   very happy i spent the extra money for it because it s saved me money   i don t have to replace a burned out hair dryer every year  used this hair dryer in an expensive hotel and had to buy one for home  love retractable cord  good power  fits nicely in drawer since it folds  such a good sized hair dryer for the price  this is not a mini  it is a full size hair dryer  has warm and hot setting  basic and durable  i travel a lot and this blow dryer folds down to fit nicely in my luggage  it s powerful and drys my hair quickly without   34 frying  34  it  i ve tried more expensive models  both andis models and other manufacturers  but i keep coming back to this blow dryer because it simply performs better than all others  after careful review i spent the extra cash to purchase this hair dryer  i ve had it for just over a year and it suddenly quite the other day  i doubt remington will do anything since it s just past the one year mark  i feel appliances should last longer than a year  i ve yet to see what remington will or won t do  i emailed them today though i ve read they have substandard costumer service  i just bought a 16  conair since i figure it s going to break within 2 years anyway why spend the extra cash  it s working great so far and is much quieter than the remington and the air is softer so my hair doesn t tangle while i style it  it also doesn t get blazing hot  it s easier to hold and it seems to be better for my hair  i love it  i really like this dryer   only had it a few weeks but so far it works great   it arrives set for a lower wattage to save energy and i did not even bother to change it   it drys quickly and as dryers go  quietly   the night light is still burning bright   some have complained too bright and that they would like a switch to turn off the light   you can always unplug it   if i was looking for faults i think they might look at how the hand held blower fits the wall bracket   it is somewhat of a tightfit   an occasional dab of soap on the base of the handle eases the snap in and out   this is a great improvement over the last brand we had  excellent hairdryer for travel   folding handle makes packing much easier as does the retractable cord   very good hair dryer  great dryer and seller wonderful dryer  really gets my hair dry quickly  i liked it so much that i bought another one for my daughter  i liked the feel of it in my hand  but it was incredibly loud   i thought i should wear hearing protection while i used it   i couldn t take it   also  the retractable cord worked only part of the time   i returned it and bought a remington   i would definitely not recommend the conair cord keeper to a friend  cost more than in regular store    should have check around other place instead on one store before i bought this one br    br    what a great blow dryer for an even better price  this was recommended to my by my stylist and i m so glad i didn t spend the big bucks on a salon brand dryer  this dryer makes such a huge difference in my hair compared to the revlon i used to use  my hair takes half the time to dry and looks shiny and smooth when finished  just like it looks when leaving the salon  a great blow dryer really does make all the difference  save your money and get this one  you won t regret it  it dries hairs fast and with a silky look  br    br   takes less time to get wonderful results and it s low noise  br    br   i recomend it used this product at a courtyard marriott and was surprised to find it better than my home hair dryer   i have thick hair  it usually took me a long time to dry my hair with my old dryer which was heavy  plus the cord got tangled  and the high heat  which i need  often got too hot   this ion hair dryer had none of those issues  so when i returned home i looked it up on the internet and was delighted to find it reasonably priced and bought it   i ve been using it for 2 months now and love it  i am an african american women with thick 4b 4c natural hair   i bought this after reading some good reviews and i have to say it wasn t that great for me   i thought it would be a bit more powerful blowing wise and it was just didn t have the blowing power i expected and didn t blow my hair out as straight as i am used to   the heat settings were just ok also  i almost could not feel the difference in medium and high heat and to be honest i much rather prefer the dryers with separate heat and speed settings because you have more control over how much heat your using to dry your hair   the comb attachments are cheaply made ans definitely seem like the break easily   overall its a decent blow dryer but not the best you can get for the price   i m actually returning mine to get something better  i know this dryer isn t the newest model out there  but  on my thin fine hair it s just perfect  love the settings  it s not to heavy or bulky in any way  great dryer in very way for me  love the yellowbird hair dryer  it does a great job in blowing out my natural hair to the length that i want compared to conair  highly recommend i only use conair blow dryers  this one is smaller than my last one  which was 5  years old   the barrel is shorter making it easier to pack for a trip  br    br   ml when using high speed setting  ordered   62   62  vidal sassoon vs783 1875 watt  60   60  that has a lot of power on high speed setting  love the color    ive been searching for a blow dryer like this but all ive been seeing are cylinder end shaped dryers    when i found this i had to get it  it shipped in two days which was great too  only reason i didnt give 5 stars is because the packaging was kind of beat up which had me skeptical for a little minute but other than that great buy this hairdryer is pretty  smooth  and makes my hair incredibly shiny  soft  smooth and frizz free  it dries my hair quicker than other hairdryers and is quieter too  love it  purchased this for a trip to italy where suitcase space was such a premium   it performed just like a full size model and i absolutely love it  i ordered this when the cord on the same exact one i had became damaged  i had it for about 5 years and didn t want to experiment with other models or brands  old reliable wins for me  i m able to straighten my daughter s very kinky hair with no problems with the comb attachment  no problems so far  i don t really use it much  but so far so good  i haven t used it yet so i can t say much   i m waiting till we move and i ll use it in the new house  this little blow dryer is amazing  it s very light weight but powerful  i was needing a blow dryer that wasn t so heavy and this dryer is the one for the job  i would recommend this to anyone wanting a lightweight dryer that does a great job as well  worked great when 1st used  small size makes it easy to hold and use   quit working after 1 months use  this is a good hair dryer   it gets the job done better than other blow dryers i have tried for my 4a  4b textured ethnic hair   i had another model of an andis hair dryer that looked similar to this particular andis style dryer and it was better than this one as it blow dryed my hair so well that i didn t even need to flat iron my hair a lot of times because it was that efficient with the proper amount of heat combined with the fine tooth comb attachment  without causing heat damage    this dryer still a relief for me as i had been going without a good blow dryer for a while and this one works for my hair compared to other brands  works great only complaint is that when using the attachment it doesn t always stay on when trying to change the diretion  it is soooo light  it s more powerful than expected  i have medium length hair and it dried quickly even on the lower setting  this is my 1st tourmaline ceramic hair dryer and i m very impressed  i plan to replace my daily dryer with this one or maybe another tourmaline ceramic one because it has definitely improved the smoothness of my hair  also comes with black white storage bag which is kinda nice  it does not fold  which i knew when i purchased it but it s not necessary feature since it s so small  highly recommend  this is exactly what i was looking for   i stayed in a hotel in nyc and this is the hair dryer they had in the bathroom  it was so good that i wrote down the model so i could order it when i got home   it dries well  folds up perfectly to fit in my cabinet  and the cord even pulls in so i can easily store it or pack it  its good i am using from long time till now there is no issues and easy to handle  i am satisfied did not like it at all  it gets way too hot and the piece does not stay on  save your money and buy a better one  there are no heat settings so you are stuck with the hot one that eventually will dry out your hair  i had to return it    like the compact feature   love the strength in blowing power  great for travel with dual wattage  br    br   would purchase again  br    br   it s a keeper  if you happen to be looking for a no frills nice performing basic hair dryer this is precisely that  it offers no bells and whistles but for the price no one should expect such  my deciding variable in a hair dryer is does it blow dry with power or is it somewhat lacking in this area  i ve had my share of the low power models and i am quite picky here   verdict  it s plenty powerful and allows for a quick exit out the door every morning  br    br      update    as of today 10 21 16 i officially lay to rest this device  honestly  it has been used 24 7 365 for just about 2 5 years which for me qualifies as a resounding endorsement of the product  at the time i paid  11   i am by no means an expert in this area but i assume it s not common to get much more than several years at best for a hair dryer subject to daily use  it s true  if you wait  the best will come to you  i am very pleased with this hair dryer  my hair dries in a matter of seconds  no kidding   however the retractable cord feature   34  does not work   34   but that s ok    it is foldable  and i am glad i purchased the andis rc 2 ionic 1875 ceramic hair dryer  i love this product   i bought it because the cord is retractable which eliminates winding around the handle or a big tangle when storing   the biggie though is how much quieter it is than my old dryer   then there is the benefit of how much faster it dries my hair   love  love  love it    i don t style my hair with a dryer  i just blow it for volume  then use the curling iron if i m in the mood   my previous one was dying  and i ve found most of the dryers today to be big and heavy  with smallish nozzles for a more concentrated flow for styling   they take forever if you just want to blow your long hair dry   this is that same model as my last one  only with half again more power  and it s very compact and lightweight  with a large nozzle for lots of airflow   it s also quieter than most the big ones i ve tried and given away   love it  love it  love it  lightweight and works fine so far   i ve had it about a week now   longer barrel than the one i had before it   no cool shot button  only high heat and low heat  which is a little cooler but not much than the high heat   my hair dries pretty fast with it   it s a pretty good buy in my opinion   my hair is long and fine and breaks easily is the reason i got it since ionic lower wattage dryers are suppose to be better for my hair type  this is the third time i have purchased this dryer over the last 10  years   they have each had a different name  but the same features   i have fairly long thick hair  and need the multiple speeds and heat settings available on this model   off is not a speed   the first 2 each lasted 5 years or more  and for an inexpensive dryer that gets used every day  i think that s pretty darn amazing   only one tiny complaint  the cord needs to be a bit longer     i was going to purchase a second dryer to leave at the beach house  but 2 weeks after the original purchase  the price had almost doubled   boooooooo    i have used this type of blow dryer my whole life and thought i would try this brand   the brush is way to soft   i was going to return it  but missed the 30 day return window  so now it is in the guest bath   i purchased the infinity pro by conair  and it was exactly what i needed  great price  great blow dryer  i travel a lot and always need a small but powerful one  i end up leaving mine behind when i go to places such as cuba where they can t get any  and i simply replace it when i get home  i bought a second one about 6 months ago  since i loved the first one i had for 5 years   the first retractable cord was great   it dried my hair quickly   this one is very different   first the cord doesn t retract completely   it didn t after the first week   then  this week the plug cracked wide open   the cheap plastic just cracked   i don t remember hitting it on anything  but maybe it happened when i tried plugging it into an old outlet   whatever happened  i ve never had a plug crack wide open before   like many other new appliances on the market  this one is inferior to the exact same model we could buy 5 years ago  happy with my new hair dryer   just a minor issue     br    br   pros  lightweight  durable  i have 2 teenagers that bang this thing around  br   cons  the attachment started to pop if you bumped it   however  i just bought some black electrical tape from dollar tree and taped the attachment on  we use it all the time  and haven t had any issues since  i love this device   the power is amazing   my hair is dry in minutes   it feels really nice in your hands too  this dryer does a great job and would merit 5 stars if it were just a tad smaller in size  although compact it delivers   my hair dries pretty quickly   it does a great job   i use this one more than my regular size expensive dryer  this is an incredibly powerful hair dryer for the size   for years i have run across this exact hair dryer at 5 star hotels all across the country   caribbean   i have really long  thick hair   always dreaded using the cheaply hotel dryers because they took forever to dry my hair  this one worked like a charm time   time again  br    br   finally  i looked it up   couldn t believe how inexpensive it was  i ordered 1 for my house   2 for my beach house  had them almost 2 years now   they still work great   br    br   my only issue is that the retractable cord gets where it won t retract sometimes  but the dryer is still powerful   works like a charm  great little dryer  especially for the price   we boondock in our motorhome all the time and don t always want to turn on the generator ti dry my hair   this little unit has much better deying power than i expected   very happy camper  was cheep and excellent home dryer  ladies can use it without burning their hair i recommend this dryer to be used at home for every body in the family  very light and drys fast  really quit and happy i bought this t3 hair dryer you will be happy to    it is quite larger and heavier than i anticipated  i know that the cord retracts into the handle but if the handle were a little narrower  it would make gripping it easier for someone with smallish hands like myself   other than that it is a great hair dryer  after reading the good to excellent reviews i purchased the dryer recently   the delivery was speedy and all the parts were included   my adult son  who s good at assembling things  put it together for me   i m african american with long locs that i roll up on curlers and my hair dried evenly at a comfortable setting   i had to place thick cushions on my folding chair  which is somewhat low   to sit high enough for my head to be covered under the dryer   i wasn t able to adjust the height locking knob to lower the hood   i ll have to call on my son again   i love the convenience of giving my hair a deep heat conditioning  rinsing  rolling it on rollers  then drying it with my own professional bonnet style hood dryer   my curls were soft and springy   i ve only used it once and so far so good for the price  timer and range of heat settings  size of the hood  ease of use  and aesthetics  i purchased this for my wife and she absolutely loves it  she says that it dries her hair fast without leaving it frizzy  in fact  we ve noticed that her hair has more shine to it since using the mk ii air  br    br   pros  br       light weight  especially for such a powerful unit br       3 settings where many only have 2 br       quiet even on the highest setting br    br   cons  br       cost  we ve never paid so much for a hair dryer  br    br   this was more than we wanted to pay but we both agree that it is worth every penny  this has our highest recommendation  i love this dryer  because has several drying setting  cool  warm  or hot  high   low  negative ion  netural ion   my husband mention how quiet  this blow dryer is to use and how fast it dries the hair  i love this hair dryer  my friend had it and i liked it so much that i bought one for myself  it comes with the two attachments and the different heat settings are great if you need to dry your hair quickly or if you are taking your time to style  light weight and dries hair fast   super quiet as advertised   highly recommend  this is a great product at a great price  i love this hair dryer  it s super quiet and doesn t get too hot on the medium setting as with many other hair dryers  i highly recommend this one  my old hair dryer was a conair that i had for about 30 years  so when replacing i felt confident in buying this brand  i did not have an ionic one before  so this one is a big improvement  my hair turns out much better and it takes much less time to dry than my old one  i am very happy with this selection  i have not tried the attachments yet  but plan on it soon  my wife loves it  much easier to handle than her old 1850 watt hair dryer  and doesn t pop our circuit breaker as it draws only 15 amps  if i knew this hair dryer was this good   more than just good   i wouldn t spend to buy many hair dryers in the past  this one is very quiet and powerful  the dryer is still cool after use it  buy one  you won t regret  i love this hair dryer  it is quiet  but powerful  i used it to replace a remington hair dryer that only lasted me a couple years  i m hoping this one last much longer i was looking for a lightweight  powerful hairdryer  and this fits the bill   i m very happy with the purchase and would recommend it  i love this as it never gets too hot and of course it s fairly portable   i can do things in the kitchen as i dry my hair   it s nice that it has a brush attachment as well  like that a lot  the cord is a little short   but this machine is strong sturdy and well built   so far so good   i m happy w the purchase  if you re extremely sensitive to sound and are looking for a quiet dryer  this is not for you   still had to wear earplugs during use  i wasn t expecting a whisper quiet operation for the price  but this is not quiet  it still woke up someone sleeping in the next room  br    br   even using the dryer as far as i could reach from my head  while using a round ceramic brush  this thing managed to tangle and damage my fine hair  i now have tons of split ends that i did not have while using  what i thought was  an inferior dryer   the  15 cheapo dryer i picked up at a big box store worked better at about the same noise level  i was looking to replace my hair dryer but didn t want to spend over a hundred dollars for it   i checked with amazon and the onei mk ii hair dryer was featured for less than half that price   i figured if it wasn t that good i would keep it as a back up   i am happy to report that this is a wonderful hair dryer  it works without the heat burning your scalp and it is more quiet than most hair dryers  my hair retains water and usually takes a long time to dry but this hair dryer does it faster   i use this hair dryer every day and will order another for my beach house   another good quality is that for a full size hair dryer  it is lighter than most  so when i went to look for a blowdryer all i really wanted it have was attachments  because i realized that not all blowdryers come with attachments  especially the one for curly hair with the little prongs  when i saw this one  i was pretty much mesmerized   not only did it come with attachments  including the diffuser   but it was pink and it a had button that would reel the cord in for you  when i got it though  did that remain true  yes  the length of the cord might not be the longest but it isn t short either  it s a rather standard size i suppose  it works perfectly like any other blowdryer  i think the only reason i am putting four stars at this point is because after being so into the reeling feature   the reel started having problems about 2 3 months into owning the blowdryer  was it serious  no  i can still push the cord into the blowdryer and everything is working fine  so if this isn t going to be a problem with you i d recommend it  it was a good buy  and i ended up coming back and buying another one of these for a friend  i looked for months to find a hair dryer that had 3 heat settings  low  med  high  and 3 actual fan speeds  low  med  high   it drives me crazy that manufacturers include off as a fan speed when in my mind  off is the lack of speed  br    br   anyway  this hair dryer is exactly what i was looking for  i ve been using it for a couple weeks now  i wanted to get some uses under my belt before i wrote a review  the review is long but i m trying to cover all the topics  br    br   fan speeds  br   high  it s a good high speed but not one that will blow you into the next room  i d compare it to a high speed found on a good quality salon dryer  br   med  finally    a real medium speed  i have very fine hair  it was hard for me to use 2 speed dryers because usually the low was too low and took forever to dry my hair and the high would make me look like i stuck my finger in an electrical socket  the medium speed was enough to dry my hair in a reasonable time and allow me to style it  br   low  a reasonable low speed  good for curly hair to keep it from frizzing  br    br   heat settings  br   high  certainly hot but not so much that it burned my fingers or scalp when drying  br   med  this is the setting i use most  it has enough heat to dry my fine hair quickly without causing it to look damaged  br   low  nice to use for curls or a slower  more refined dry style  br    br   noise level  much quieter than i thought it would be  i have some more expensive dryers that i d like to wear ear plugs with  even my boyfriend commented on the lower sound  br    br   buttons controls  some people have commented on the stiffness of the slide adjustments  are they stiff  a bit  but honestly  i d rather them that way  the slide controls for the fan and heat are right where you are going to hold the dryer when using it  in my opinion  they need to be stiff so you don t move them accidentally when you are using the dryer  nothing i hate more than drying my hair only to have my thumb hit a switch to high and blast myself on accident  i have arthritis in my hands and fingers but i don t find the slides hard to move  it just takes a deliberate motion to move them up or down  the cold shot button is easy to push in and not difficult to hold for longer periods if you need to  br    br   attachments  it comes with a diffuser and a concentrator attachment  both function quite well  they snap in  so no falling off while you re using them  the push buttons used to detach are easy to push  br    br   as a whole  br   this dryer is a fantastic buy  i m going to order another one to keep as a back up  the cord has a nice little strap to keep it bundled up if you need to travel with it or store it  the 3 real fan speeds and heat settings are what you would expect them to be  it doesn t get hot on the exterior when you use it and it won t blow out your eardrums either which gives it a big thumbs up in my book  the color seems pretty close to what is pictured on amazon s site  it s nice  but i really didn t buy it for looks  it dries hair quickly and without causing frizz  there was no buyers remorse with this guy  it was well worth the time i spent looking and well worth the money i paid switch to high and blast myself on accident  i have arthritis in my hands and fingers but i don t find the slides hard to move  it just takes a deliberate motion to move them up or down  the cold shot button is easy to push in and not difficult to hold for longer periods if you need to  br    br   attachments  it comes with a diffuser and a concentrator attachment  both function quite well  they snap in  so no falling off while you re using them  the push buttons used to detach are easy to push  br    br   as a whole  br   this dryer is a fantastic buy  i m going to order another one to keep as a back up  the cord has a nice little strap to keep it bundled up if you need to travel with it or store it  the 3 real fan speeds and heat settings are what you would expect them to be  it doesn t get hot on the exterior when you use it and it won t blow out your eardrums either which gives it a big thumbs up in my book  the color seems pretty close to what is pictured on amazon s site  it s nice  but i really didn t buy it for looks  it dries hair quickly and without causing frizz  there was no buyers remorse with this guy  it was well worth the time i spent looking and well worth the money i paid  this is a very simple but great blower   we are using it daily and are happy with it   good product  great for traveling  have a little trouble getting cord to retract but i haven t used it much  so should loosen up as i use it  it s soooo tiny  and powerful  it works great so far for it s purpose  the only thing i d want is a comb attachment   cause you know  natural hair needs to be straightened sometimes  overall great product  especially for curls this dryer is great   it compares with a  100  dryer for a fraction of the cost   i was so excited to find this on amazon  as it s so much cheaper than at ulta   really  really great device  and the attachments only add to that  this is the best blow dryer i have ever used   it is extremely light weight and my thick hair is blow dried very quickly without my arm getting tired and sore   my hair looks amazing too  shiny ans smooth   in the past  i often didn t dry all the way because it took too long  but now my hair looks great everyday because it works so effectively by drying so fast   i love this hair dryer   definately worth the money  i splurged for a really nice blow dryer   it was pretty quiet and did the job every other day   pretty normal usage   but  this morning while using it  it just stopped   i tried to unplug it from the surge protector and it had fused itself to it   not what i expected from an  80 hair dryer  i m just glad it wasn t plugged into the wall   would not recommend  i ordered this dryer  based on all the good reviews but also a little apprehensive because of of the few negative reviews  but because of the price  i decided to try it  i am glad i bought this hair dryer  it s very light and quiet and  i like that there is a cool air button so you don t have to keep your finger on it like most dryers  great dryer for me     i am now reviewing after 5 months of use   well      it died on me today     it did perform well while it worked  disappointed    after years with my old hairdryer  i found that the new  cheaper ones were just that  cheap   this is great hairdryer   it actually makes my hair look better    gives my short hair more body   it is very quiet    my dogs don t run out of the bathroom   works great and feels like it should last    this is ok for personal use but not a beauty shop   the extended legs get in the way and is not easy to maneuver   heat is ok not real hot   i would recommend for home use only  love the hairdryer   just what i was looking for and perfect for taking with on trips instead of packing the big dryer  the item arrived perfectly on time and in great condition  it has an adequate blowing system and heating for my medium texture of hair  i love this blow dryer its like one of the coolest things ive ever seen i got tired of the wires from a blow dryer being all on the floor and ground and this product eliminates that problem its pretty strong too  i have very thick  frizzy  and what you could call   34 confused  34  hair  not wavy or curly or straight   i have straightened my hair with a blow dryer since i was 13 years old  needless to say  i have been through a lot of blow dryers  this is the best one i have ever had  i m on my second and about to buy my third  for backup   it does get pretty hot  but i alternate with the low and high setting depending on which part of my hair i m doing and how much is in the piece  i highly recommend this blow dryer if you have thick  unruly hair as myself  it s a beast  what used to take me hours now takes me 30 40 minutes tops  very happy  i had a really old conair that i liked but it was quite shabby  so replaced it with what i knew should be a good hairdryer  the different heat levels are great with the cool down to set the curl i am a fan of t3 items for years  this dryer seems to dry my hair very fast  leaving it shiny i first used this hair dryer in a hotel after that i had to have one  i found it on amazon  made the purchase and i am very pleased with my purchase  the hair dryer performance is very good   the cord is a problem   while the retractable cord is a great idea   it is not long enough   often when i use it  it stalls because of the pulling on the cord at the plug outlet  i wasted so much money on a few hair dryers  i wish i would have ordered this one first  its a really great hair dryer i stayed at a lowe s hotel in la last year and they had this hairdryer in the hotel room and feel in love with it   i liked it s compact  lightweight feel and it comes with a diffuser that i keep on all the time   i find it dries my hair quickly and it was relatively inexpensive for the  19 i paid for it  works great  not heavy on the hands to use and it doesn t fry my hair   i have baby thin fly away wavy hair and this blower keeps it in control with minimal heat   definitely recommend  as usual amazon delivers on time or before time  wanted same brand and wattage they have on the wall at our y  br   perfect   just what my spouse was looking for  i purchased this because i travel abroad quite a bit and needed a reliable hair dryer  i took this and all of my friends took theirs  mine was the only one left standing  the dual wattage allows me to use this in america and also when i go places  i am very pleased with this product  product arrived on schedule   have looked for several years for a decent  reasonably br   priced hairdryer which is lightweight with several heat settings  and not too loud  br   the decibel level was always the deal breaker   not with this revlon hairdryer   very br   pleased   this is a great  lightweight hair dryer  i have very thick hirt hair and this dryer dries it quickly and nicely  i tried this hair dryer in a very upscale marriott hotel and was so impressed i came home and purchased  lightweight and powerful  great hair dryer  drys my hair quickly with less frizzy dried out hair  would definiitely recommend this hair dryer to all this is a great hair dryer and a great deal  the price is definitely a steal for a very nice  good working dryer i take this hair dryer anytime i travel  it s small  but still has the drying capabilities of a  normal  sized hair dryer  purchased this through amazon a few years ago and it s still working as good as the first time i used it  this is the third time i have bought this model  i love that it mounts on the wall so i don t have it in a drawer or on the counter  the night light is a bonus  each one lasts about 5 years before the plastic breaks or wears out  this dryer is works really well on my thick  african american and mexican american  hair and very quickly  i bought it mainly because of the comb attachment  it s slightly heavier than other hair dryers but is also more visually appealing  if you switch attachments while you dry your hair this isn t or you  they get very hot  hope this helps  so  i like quiet  powerful hairdriers  my last one broke  and i ordered this one  it does what it needs to  great  this thing is amazing  i was tired of using the crappy cheap one my mom bought for me and my sisters  this thing i hav seen all over youtube and can t get enough of it  it works well and mounts easily the night light is mounted in the handle and give just the right amount of light so i like it for a hairdryer but i bought is as a quiet hairdryer for grooming a skittish pup and it is not quiet  can dry and style my coarse hair quickly especially with the special straightener attachment without too much fuss and effort i am so happy this hair dryer is light  well functioned and totally enough for daily use and travel  highly recommend this product  i bought this product yesterday  and took it out of the box for a test run  immediately  i liked the color and how light it was  i really wanted to love this dryer  i promise  br    br   so  i get it out of the box and unwrap it  comes with a set of instructions and an individually wrapped concentrator  never really use those  but cool  okay  i attach the concentrator to the blowdryer  and plug it in   not near any kind of water whatsoever  i assure you  br    br   i let it blow out air for a few seconds and adjusted the heat  no lie  literally ten seconds after it was turned on  the blow dryer turned an intense red color  i thought it was just a gimmicky effect  but no    the heat was spreading quickly toward the handle and it became unbearable to hold due to the heat within miliseconds  i quickly shut it off  only to see sparks flying out of the dryer  for a good five seconds  br    br   okay  maybe i did something wrong  maybe it was a fluke  i take off the concentrator just for good luck  and plug it in again  the thing roars to life  becoming red  and starts to shoot out sparks again almost immediately  a few unfortunate strands of my hair are caught in the frenzy of it all  and are singed  br    br   i m so glad that i didn t wait until i actually had to dry my hair to test this item out    who knows what would ve happened if the dryer were closer to my hair     br    br   i thought i got a lemon of a product  but a quick google search proved me otherwise    check the one star ratings here  and you ll know what i m talking about  a woman on one of the sites i found during my search   search   34 dangerous revlon hair dryer malfunction   planetfeedback  34  to see what i m talking about   wrote that she actually got third degree burns from her product and is planning to sue  br    br   i m shipping this thing back  and am never trusting revlon again  please  save your money  and yourselves    do yourselves a favor and invest in a different product  traveling a lot for work  this is great for on the go compact and powerful hair drying products  comes with cute bag and diffuser  love it  i have owned an andis mini dryer before and was very pleased   so far this little dryer works great  too   i m happy to recommend it to others  great dryer and best for styling     the heat is perfect and had it on time and a great product   love to have it perfect  great price  great size  it was a gift and she loved it so much  100  recomended  the only thing was that the box was too big for it  very good buy for the price my only complaint is the timer is also the power knob   when the dryer is on it ticks the entire time which gets annoying after awhile especially that one of the awesome feature is the dryer itself is very quiet  my wife and daughter love this  best blow dryer ever  worth the money  hair feels nice and soft after using this  love this hair dryer  used this model for about 8 years  yes the give out like all hair dryers and i have to buy a new one  but quality is always the same when i have to get a new one  very powerful and dries hair quickley  this is so much more convenient than dragging a dryer from a drawer or cabinet   hotels have had the right idea all along  i love this dryer  its easy on your hair and it came with attachments   it also arrived quickly and in perfect shape  it is the best  hair dryer i have ever used   br   and it is working very good   and it is the best for it s price   br   thank you   i took this on my vacation and it worked wonderfully  so i purchased another  the bag will hold more than just the dryer  i threw in combs and a few other small items  i will be buying a third as a gift  so far i love this hairdryer  i ve only had it for a few months  but it replaced my old conair hairdryer that i had for over 10 years  it s fairly quiet  which is kind of a big deal  and it works really quickly  plus  its like this soft matte finish  and it doesn t slip out of my hands  i m hoping it lasts as long as my last hairdryer  i had high hopes for this blow dryer   considering the high price and great reviews  i expected much more   some said it cut drying time in half  but i didn t find this to be true   it works great  but i don t see any difference in my hair   it s kind of heavy and it took a little getting used to as far as the different balance of the weight   i don t think i would pay this much for my next hair dryer  i have used the dryer several times and it works great   i had questions which were answered promptly by other customers which was helpful in making my decision   definitely recommend  its been a week i received this hair dryer and so far i am satisfied with its performance  it is very light and small  infact smaller than a fold able hair dryer  perfect for traveling  it heats up instantly and dries hair faster  i intend to use it outside the country and hoping it will keep up in its performance  br   however  i think changing the voltage is not easy  have to figure it out  br   one of the reason i am giving it 5 star is for amazon s service  the price of this item reduced by  5 since the time i purchased it  i happened to notice it and called amazon  they swiftly refunded my money  couldn t be happier  this dries my hair extremely fast and it has incredibly affordable  i am extremely glad i bought this product  it also comes with attachments that are handy  i bought this for an upcoming trip   it is super lightweight and easy to use   it doesn t have a cold shot but i don t need one   it also doesn t have a folding handle  but it is still super small   my 2 year old can handle it as it is lighter than her toy one   it is also perfect for her hair on low   i do recommend this to anyone especially those with mobility and dexterity issues   it is super lightweight  super small  about the size of a female s hand spread out  dries almost  as fast as my babyliss toniro full sized dryer   it is also cheap and comes with a little bag to put it in  though my baby has took it as her own along with the dryer  br    br   edited  it does include a concentrator and a diffuser  though that diffuser is so small   i don t have curly hair  so i don t  use it  this dryer was more than i expected   i had an old 1875   it dries my hair so quickly and the settings are great  excellent  very high volume of air  good heat control  easy to hold   seems to be very high quality  blow dryer  it s a good dryer  but it am downgrading it for not being brand new  the item we received was an open item  with signs of usage  the package was not sealed and the manual was missing  i bought this to replace my wall mounted dryer that i bought for  5 at a yard sale 15 years ago which finally bit the dust   i didn t really believe the tourmaline hype but this dryer does seem to make it easier to comb out long  tangled hair   and the hair seems silkier when dry   i would give the product 5 stars except you can t turn off the night light   i ve mounted it inside a cabinet where i can shut the door but otherwise would have to put ugly black tape over the light   with so many studies showing that light disrupts healthy sleep  one would think that manufacturers would stop putting night lights on everything  or at least offer the option to turn it off   if i wanted a night light  i would buy one   i shouldn t have to put up with one on a  50 hair dryer  what you see is what you get  i ve been wanting one for a very long time  i am very satisfied with my new hair dyer  bought this because i loved the hidden real away cord   works great and puts out lots of air   drys hair fast  love it  this is a great hair dryer  it is a little heavy but it works so well  who cares  it has great temperature settings and dries hair fast  it s everything the other 4 5 star reviewers said  my favorite part is the soft sound and the long cord   and of course amazons service is one of the best    love amazon      update   8 months after purchasing this dryer  i pressed the cold shot button and it would not pop back out  i was unable to send it back to amazon for an exchange but they told me to contact the manufacturer and that it was still on warranty  i did and onei beauty made it simple  i send it back to them and they ll send me another  voila  done  i m not sure how long this product will last  but feel confident that the company will take good care of me should it happen again within a reasonable time frame  because after all i really love this dryer   arrived good  after 6 months in used  broked        it s a shamed that product didn t last   shamed on you br   i don tt have the ticket anymore  this is the best blow dryer i ve ever purchased  i have very very long curly hair  it s also a bit thick  i m mixed so finding just the right blow dryer is paramount  it makes the difference in a good hair day and a bad hair day  when i m done  my hair has the appearance of being flat ironed  i love it  br    br   the medium comb is what i use mostly  therefore  i sort of go through them rather quicly  they usually last over a year  the other great thing about this blow dryer is it s dual voltage  yes  dual voltage  i travel outside of the country most of the year  and this blow dryer is standard packing for me  br    br   the price here is considerably less than what i paid  i purchased mine from sally s  go figure  ladies if your have hair like mine  this blow dryer is a must have  teenage daughter   34 had to have  34  one of these  reluctantly  i bought  been a superb product without issues since purchase and she uses literally daily  would buy again  but hope i don t have too  smiles    i bought this and it broke the second time i used it   i do not use my blow dryer often  so when i finally used it again the second time  it made a very loud noise and then would not power on again i am still using this machine  it really is a great blow dryer  it dries your hair quickly  it is worth the purchase  the main reason i bought this hair dryer 2 years age  it s because it was advertised as being quiet   i can t stand noisy hair dryers  and although it s not as quiet as i expected  it is quieter than all of the other ones i ve bought   it s has great power  it s light  easy to handle and it leaves my hair smooth and shinny   2 weeks ago it started to fail  i couldn t turn it off  so i d just unplug it  but this morning it completely stopped working   so over all  i think i did get my money s worth  because i blow dry my hair every single day and it takes about 10 min  so the price is really good vs  the quality  i even bought another one just now   hope this helps  i love it   i have never had a blow dryer that was as quiet as this one  love the pieces that come with it  after spending some nights in motels with wall mounted hair dryers i wanted one  sunbeam seemed the most popular and best  so i bought this one  br    br   minor complaints  br        power cord to outlet is too short for my situation  i live in an apartment  outlet is on one side of the hand towel rack  i had to mount it on the other side so the cord is flopping at a diagonal under the towels  i wanted to mount the dryer higher but the cord wouldn t reach  br        i also use the dryer to other parts of my body due to psoriasis which is aggravated by moisture and  my feet which are prone to moisture related problems and the cord between the base and the dryer makes doing this awkward  br        night light is ok doesn t affect my sleep  but if i had known it was available without the night light i would have bought that instead  this is my second purchase of this daily use dryer   the first one lasted about 10 years   i was so thrilled to find that it was still on the market  this one is so great because it has lots of power and the blower settings low and high  are separate from the heat settings cool  warm  and hot  i use the hotel provided dryers when i travel and am always so happy to get home to the best blow dryer ever  i love this little hair dryer from andis   i have had one for years and it works great  does not take up much room in my suit case when i travel and does not cost much   i would recommend this hair dryer to anyone  i first tried this at a marriott and loved the hidden cord   i m tired of multiple cords on my counter   the speed is great as is the power   it dries my hair faster that my old drier  it s dries your hair quickly and it s not too loud   this is the second one that i ve bought   the first one lasted about 6 years and then the cord wore out and was exposing bare wires but the motor never wore out   great product  this dryer does it job  and i used it for tasks beyond its description  it works great and still functioning  i ve been using this as my daily hairdryer for a couple months now  it works very well  and has more power for the size than i would have expected  that being said  it s still small  it has as much blowing heat power as my old one  huge clunky   but i still think it takes slightly longer to dry my hair just because the size of the dryer itself doesn t allow as much air to blow at once  i do love how it is so light and easy to use though  best price i have seen  plus great quality  super quiet  not a giant long annoying cord  not too short of a cord either  love love love the diffuser attachment since i have curly hair  attachments stay on really well  low and warm does a great job on my thin and super curly hair  we ended up buying two of these  one for each bathroom  great hair dryer  not too loud  multi speed and compact out of the way  like the ones in nice hotels it has it s own gfci protector so it can be installed by the sink  save a drawer in the vanity  or get the counter cleaned off  i m not one to buy expensive haircare products but after a stay at a hotel  i fell in love with the blow dryer in the rooms   i wrote down the brand and model and set out to find one when i got home   amazon was the only place that was still selling this model   i almost bought 2 in case they go out of production but i guess i ll just use this one and hope it lasts forever  lol  perfect hairdryer  i m glad i found this on amazon for an amazing price  i plan on buying a few for gifts to give out  this blow dryer packs a lot of power   small  convenient and easy to use   the wall mount keeps it nicely tucked away between uses   it is exactly like the ones you find in hotels which is what i was looking for  i have had this hair dryer for a few years now  it works great  the only setback is that the point started chipping after a year around the nozzle blower  perhaps it is from the water in my hair when i blow dry  i am not sure  but either way it works great and has lasted for a long time  the attachments are a pain in the butt to put on and off    we had one of these before and like it  this one is basically the same  it does have a funny sound to it that i don t think is normal which has me a little worried  but it still works fine i think  works perfectly great quality  i trust this brand  so didn t hesitate when buying it and was not disapointed  i reccommend  bought this for my condo which we rent out and have always been happy with conair   i like the night light because i always had a night light in the bathroom and now this serves 2 purposes  great powerful not too noisy dryer for about a year  then it loses power   even at this price  i expect a blow dryer to last longer than a year of home use by one person  works great and is light to handle for a medium size hair dryer   also very easy to travel with and pack  it says that it s dual voltage  but it took about a minute to burn out after being plugged into a 220 outlet in 220 mode  also  the mechanism to switch between voltages requires a screw driver  so make sure to do that before your trip  because most of us don t bring screwdrivers when traveling  bought two of  these   and the best item ever  works nicely   fit on wall great and easy to install   buying one more for my dad   pros  it is dual voltage  120 volts 60 hertz or 240 volts 50 hertz  allowing you to use it in the us and abroad  there is a screw for you to change the voltage  it s almost as powerful and heats up like a regular dryer  which is a huge plus for me   i ve got a ton of hair and those wimpy hotel sunbeam wall mount dryers just don t cut it  br    br   cons  it s expensive  i would not invest in this as your every day dryer as you can get a better full size dryer for the price but if you travel a lot  as i do  the voltage option is key  it s a lot heavier and bulkier than the typical travel hair dryer so i would not recommend this if you re looking for something small  there is a hinge at the handle that allows it to fold but it s still far from compact  br    br   i ve been taking this dryer with me to europe and it works great  i ve been using it intermittently for a year and it s still going strong  essentially  it s a full size dryer but with a voltage option   however  i don t use this in lieu of my full size dryer because i love my light weight fhi nano  bought it for the wife  and she no longer keeps the blow dryer under the sink  i would say she liked it to   this is the nicest blow dryer i have ever had and it s very reasonably priced  i am really happy with it  i bought this hair dryer just to travel with  i used it in ireland and it worked great  all you need is an adapter  don t use a converter  the hair dryer will zap out the converter  my sister and i were both pleased with the strength of this little hair dryer  we both have really thick hair   it s light and compact  so it travels well  i haven t used it in the states yet  but i assume it will be just as good  this is my second conair 1875  purchased this one as a replacement because my previous one was on the verge of kicking the proverbial bucket  i had that one for about 6 years   br    br   there isn t anything fancy about this hairdryer  but it s also pretty damn cheap so one shouldn t really be expecting bells and whistles  br    br   it does the job  and in my experience holds up very well  brush too soft  the hair dryer too bulky  i would like to return it  i do not know how  please  respond  this is very cheap  and has a lower wattage than most of the dryers on the market   i needed less power  because i have curly hair and use this on the low setting with a diffuser   worth the price  but don t be surprised if it dies after a year or so   i m on my 3rd one   the price is still worth it  though  so i keep buying more  it is ok  but i thought might be more powerful  but does the job for me since my hair is not very thick   has some good br   attachments also  fairly priced  not enough heat   take long time for long hair drying  have to buy  another one which is more powerful i bought this for my wife and daughter  they tell me that it works great  very good product and price  i have been using this for for a few weeks and am impressed   it replaced a 10 year old dryer and has made a difference in my morning routine   it seems a bit heavier than my old one but the speed of drying is worth it  after receiving a conair cordkeeper for christmas and only using it about 8 times  it died  lucky i was able to get my money back at walmart  so i decided to read lots of amazon reviews on hairdryers in the  20  30 price range and chose this one  br   i loved it the first time i used it  it s a bit heavier but not bothersome at all  and i even have tennis elbow which prevents me from lifting things a certain way  if they weigh over 3  or so  this is very comfortable in the hands  has enough settings  a cold shot button  and most importantly  a diffuser for when i want to go from stick straight hair to beachy waves  the quality seems great and sturdy  i love the pink on it  and whatever the coating is is also pretty cool  br   after my conair experience  i don t have much faith in new hairdryers  i was using an old folding travel dryer i have  from 2007  that still works great and i plan on using for traveling  so my intent was to use the remington for the diffuser  however  i think i will use it everyday  as it dries my hair fast and keeps it shiny and is just fun to use  i ve had andis hair dryers before and they ve always served their purpose well  i particularly like this one because it has an off switch  it is a tad heavier than another andis i had  the night light does not bother me in fact it really is a great night light  although the green needs a bit of getting used to  great hair dryer works just like the big boys  same power  light weight  i love it for travel  comes with a nice carry bag  edit  2  again  the cool shot button is stuck in the on position   i can not believe this has happened again   i will not be trying to run this company down again as the first time was hassle enough   save your time  money and energy by purchasing from a well known brand  br    br   edit   i received my replacement hair dryer today and i hope the cool shot button doesn t give me trouble because i really love this hair dryer  thank you  br    br   this dryer is very quiet and i am impressed by how hot it can get  most of the time i use it on warm only as hot can get too hot really fast  i loved it until this morning  i pressed the cool shot button to set my curl and the button would not pop back up  thank goodness i was nearly done blow drying my hair because i could only blow cold air unless i physically pried the button back up  even if i barely touched the cool shot button with my finger  it would blow cold and i would again have to pry it back out  so now i am stuck with an expensive 6 month old dryer that will only blow cold  waiting to hear back from the manufacturer about the warranty  it s more of a hassle than anything  especially with our humid summer starting and no blow dryer to tame this frizz ball  its a great hairdryer  it blows hot air  at 3 speeds with a cold air setting  i can t imagine what else a hair dryer needs to do  and at  10 amazing value    this is not the best hair dryer out there  i know you could get better ones for the same price that will dry your hair very quickly  but i mainly bought it for the way it looks  i love the retro style and it goes well with my taste  it s an all right product  and i don t have such unmanageable hair to need anything more high tech  it fits my purposes just fine  i recommend this hair dryer because it works well and is easy to install in your bathroom   the price is right too  the lady who received it  loved it  she had selected it from all the similar products advertized  it continues to serve her well  this dryer frees up space on the counter top  it isn t very powerful so that s why i gave it four stars  i had to have someone install it for me so that added additional cost  i like the fact that it is all white  i have used this model for many years  when one wares out i buy another  it does not last supper long  but works well for me at a very reasonable price  from experience  it works as well as anything else in this style and price range  i hope they never stop making this model  my only regret is that i didn t find what is essentially the same hair dryer   also available from amazon   without the wasted  and unneeded  plastic frame  housing    frame    above the unit br    br   this product attached to the wall with the double faced   34 sticky things  34   included  it hasn t fallen off  it dries my hair  i m happy  first of all  let s put things in perspective    i am not a stylist   i don t use a blow dryer to style my hair  but rather to dry it after showering   i have very thin  fine hair that dries quickly but easily gets frizzy and fly away   the hand dryer i ve had for over 15 years did the job  but unless i used a leave in conditioner before drying  my hair would often end up looking like shredded wheat   not attractive  br    br   so when it came time to buy a new dryer  i took a look at the ionic ones  which claim to leave hair soft and silky instead of frizzy and fly away   and since this one was so inexpensive  i figured i d give it a try  br    br   well  it s fabulous   when dried with this dryer  my hair actually feels silky   and my hair has never felt silky   and to make things even better  that silkiness lasts between shampoos  br    br   i ve read a few complaints here that the blower on this dryer isn t strong enough  or it doesn t get hot enough   they may have a point    the air emitted does seem to be less hot than my much older conair   but the blower seems strong enough for me   my hair dries in about the same amount of time as it did with my old dryer  br    br   but what makes this so great isn t the heat or the amount of air  it s the ionic thing   i don t know why it works  or how it works  but i love this thing  and the fact that it actually costs less than the one i bought fifteen years ago is just icing on the cake  br    br   it s a great dryer and it won t set you back much   what s better than that  very happy with this blower dryer so far  everything works just right  small  light  long power cord is great benefit too  i ve been using this dryer for a couple weeks and i feel good about my purchase  i m not seeing dramatic frizz reduction or anything but it does seem to have helped  a bit with my flyaway prone hair  i can definitely say that it is faster than my old dryer  and i m amazed at how quiet it is   i wish it was a bit smaller as it is sort of hard to store but other than that i am very happy  best blow dryer my girlfriend has ever had  bought this and straight iron said she has had all kinds including two hundred dollar straighteners  this is best ever i have purchased a number of conair hair dryers   they last forever  this dryer came with a diffuser in the box  which is a great addition  while it does not have a multitude of settings  it has what you need to get your hair dry  it is not insanely loud  either  if you are looking for a good work horse hair dryer that will last  look no further than this conair  i agree with the comments that this hair dryer works even better than the one i regularly use and is regular size   i haven t used it for travel yet as i am still planning my trip to italy    i look forward to using the dual voltage feature   and this isn t too large for packing as some have indicated   the handle folds nicely and will take up far less room in my suitcase over my regular dryer  had the same model before but in blue  this is a newer model as i great  loves the cord retraction i have been searching for a decent hair dryer that would not cost an arm and a leg   this hair dryer has far exceeded my expectations on both   it is an incredible hair dryer   quiet and really powerful and it cost less than  100     and it leaves my hair feeling incredible   no frizz or flyways  bought these for our rental beach house   the retractable cord was our favorite feature   a good price for this unit  besides the fact that i love the color  this is a dynamo of a blow dryer   i have been using conair products since my very 1st blow dryer over 30 years ago   their quality is excellent and long lasting   the retractable cord along with the excellent reviews made it an easy choice   i highly recommend this product  works great and i can channel the heat to a specific area when drying   a little big but is manageable  thanks  works great  i take it with me for all of my side jobs as a stylist  and it s small and portable enough to go everywhere  can t help but to brag about this to everyone  this hair dryer works so good and dries hair super fast  it is heavy though so don t drop it on your toe like i did  love all the settings it has  compact  dry hair fast  great buy for the price  it fits in any size suitcases or bags  used it in europe with no problem  i have been using it for 3 weeks now  every morning to dry my hair and i love it  the color is nice  red  not pink   it is not too loud  there are 2 speeds and 3 temperatures  i use high speed and medium temperature and it dries my medium length hair in a few minutes  if i use the high temperature  the drying time is about half  there is one feature that i totally love   the retracting cord   no more wrapping the cord around the hair dryer  love it  this hair dryer is the easiest to use and its affordable and the most hassle free dryer but def not a pro styler  this is a powerful blower  it shortens the drying time  and it is not that noisy  well if i compare it to the one i had for 4 years  great quality  i am please my dominican hair stylist recommended to me  i definitely recommend it to you  it is worth the price  great hair dryer with 3 speeds  which is super hard to find    i have dry curly hair and really want a low speed and a medium speed    also folds for travel and has removable concentrator attachment  it works fine i love it i use it every sunday its nice and hot  its works fine like a dryer in a salon love  love  love it   its not very heavy or particularly loud and the amazing thing is  it actually reels the cord in   this dryer does really make a difference in a fuller head of hair appearance using the sonic property of this dryer   the heat and intensity choices work great and the retraction of the cord is a nice feature  easy to use  it has two different attachments and several speeds to choose from  it works well for home use  i ve used this hair dryer for a week now   it s your average but good ol  conair product   i have always liked the conair brand better than revlon   they last longer   the warm setting on this one is only slightly warm so it s easy to have to bump up to hot   the cord is a little short compared to my last one  revlon  but it doesn t impede usage at all for me   the vent trap is easy to clean and i don t accidentally bump any buttons while using which is nice   it s not as heavy as i expected based on other reviews   overall happy with my purchase  especially considering the price  we bought this for our rental property and it works very well   i would highly recommend it to anyone for your home or rental property  compact  light  not too noisy compared to others  high quality for the price  came in perfect condition  i use it every day and it s still perfect  there was nothing that i really didn t like about it  br   and these are the things that i liked  br   firstly  it s cheap  secondly  it s small and not so heavy  thirdly  i ve had it for 5 months now and it s still blowing hot air  i love it came in excellent condition   i absolutely br   love it i have every positive thought about my blow dryer quiet  very light and long cord  work as promised  cool air wonderful  medium heat is all required    br   loved the 2 attachments that came with it  br   came earlier than expected  very nice small convenient dryer for travel  i liked this and its a good purchase who need dryer on travel  used this hair dryer at a hotel and had to have one   it s light weight  retract cord and high powered  it was a present for sis in law for her bday  she loves doing hair  she loved it            i was pleasantly pleased with this hair dryer on my recent trip abroad  it will likely replace my full sized hair dryer on future trips  really got what i waz expecting   great price and straight from japan i m gonna buy more as a present for my sister  i love it  i am a hair stylist and i was looking for a decent one just for myself at home  and boy were my standards exceeded  its very powerful for its size and i love the attachments that cone with it  great price for a great blow dryer  very happy  it have  a little flaws on the surface  but does not affect me to use it  nice shipping  i will come again this dryer blows nicely  but does not get hot enough to dry hair quickly  it takes a really long time to dry hair  and it comes up frizzy due to drying it with low heat  i waited too long to return it  so am stuck with it going to use it to dry my dogs hair after bathing  be sure to return within the given time period if you find it does not get hot enough  mine may be defective  i like  the easy access of the dryer hanging on the wall rather than stored in the vanity drawer  it works well plus takes up little space  my wife liked it after they sent the necessary parts to assemble the hood  it may be a bit noisy but  it s okay  this is the second sunbeam oster   34 wall  34  mount hair dryer we have had over br   perhaps the past twenty years  and we have never been more satisfied   it br   looks good on our bathroom wall  and it is not intrusive in any way   it is also br   quiet and easy to keep clean   i recommend it highly   also  thanks to amazon  br   it is the worlds best shopping source  it is light weight  easy to hold  and it s two levels of power make it perfect for all hair styling  absolutely love this hairdryer  it has a special grip coating that keeps it from slipping around  and is powerful enough to dry my thick hair quickly without frizzing my old conair was great  this one is weak and the attachments fall off mid use   will be replacing soon  don t recommend  i had not purchased a hair dryer in 14 years  i was still using my mary kate   ashley olsen hair dryer from my youth   having worked at ulta during college  i grew to love the hot tools products   i was waiting to purchase this brand of hair dryer after using other hot tools styling tools when my hair dryer finally gave out   on the day that my blow dryer finally died  i quickly purchased this model   sure  it has several speed and heat settings  but it s nothing special   my itty bitty hair dryer from 2000 did as good of a job as the ion ceramic multi function hair dryers of present day   i don t think you re going to notice a difference in dryers until you really jump into a different price bracket with the t 3s and chi s   i think i could have spend about  15 less and still achieved the same look and quality   i have very long and thick hair  and unfortunately  the speed of drying has not changed even with a much newer and larger model than the one i chose to use 14 years ago  the product design is lacking   controls on handle but not set in so very easy to turn off while styling your hair   clumsy design   may want to spend a little more for a quality product   not to be deceived by the picture  this thing runs day and night at my house and is still going many months later   what more do you need to know this dryer is quite loud  but i love that it is ionized and ceramic and light weight   i don t use a hair dryer much so it works well for me  4 stars because it is a great blowdryer  but the only con is that the cord is kind of short  it is very efficient and blow dries my hair silky smooth and sleek  it comes with some accesories as well which is a plus such as a difuser  i would recommend it to anyone for the great price  simply put this is the best hair dryer i have ever owned  love the speeds and the ease of use  it s not heavy to hold i think i got a dud it doesn t blow hot heat  my old hair dryer blows more heat to dry hair faster i first ordered on of these hair dryers about 5 years ago after using it  at a hotel in maui  it s light weight and  works well for my baby fine hair  i always have a hard time finding a simple hair dryer that has the right combination of power and heat  the first one i ordered lasted about 3 years  i think that s about the life for this product since it does not have a removable vent filter to clean  but   after trying a few others i went right back to the tried and true  i received this blow dryer fast  my other conair broke after many years  this new one works great   my hair dries fast  i ve never had a blow dryer with a diffuser and i have wavy curly hair  this diffuser works great and my hair looks great after using it  this is about the 4th hair dryer i have had that hangs on the wall  i won t have any other style  it makes using the dryer so convenient  you don t have to take it out of the drawer  the little cord hook is very nice the night light is an additional bonus  for the size of the dryer  it s quite heavy and there is no attachment for the end of the dryer to direct flow   less than ideal  it is soooo small and perfect for travel  it has pretty good power and the travel case was a nice touch  it can t be used as hot as i wished   seems that the engine would not bear the temperature   design is clean and i like it  i ve been using this dryer for over 10 years  or close   it has the best power and can get my hair straight or can diffuse it exactly how i want it with the settings  will continue buying if anything ever happens to it  the color is much prettier here on amazon than in person   in person it is a much darker red  not as bright and shiny   the attachments go on hard and the finger diff user is just so large that it really can t be used effectively   the back cover comes off for easy cleaning and it does  nicely and the screen is easy to clean   the angle attachment works good   for the price  it is a good deal  br    br   still a great deal  love my hair dryer   i didn t use the diffuser  so i sold it on ebay and the hair dryer paid for itself      very quiet  works great  it was scratched on the light colored plastic  it looks like maybe they removed a sticker  it s not horrible i just didn t expect a new item to be scratched like that  easy to put together  and after reading reviews before my purchase i will add it did come with the plug in cord  i m very happy with it  im a cosmetologist and i have a 1 chair salon this works perfect for me  i don t think i ll ever be able to use a regular blow dryer again   this one is the best ever  have lots of hair but the medium heat seems to handle it well  i m happy with it   hope it last long  i was honestly not expecting that much from this blowdryer due to its low cost  but i am happy to report that i really underestimated it   it is lightweight  has a reasonably powerful motor  and a good range of power and temperature selections   i also like that it features tourmaline ceramic as this really does help to smooth my hair   the lint filter on the back is also very easy to clean  which is important   i ve burned out several blowdryers due to clogged air intake  but i know it won t happen with this one as the lint is so easy to remove   the only reason i m giving this blowdryer four stars instead of five is because it is not quite as powerful as others i ve used  which adds a little extra time to my blowdrying  maybe a couple of minutes   it really is a nice blowdryer overall and a terrific value  originally purchased elsewhere for  10 more  returned that one and got it here cheaper  been using for a few weeks and loving it  definitely needed an upgrade and this is a great buy  this is a great dryer for the price   occasionally i have trouble retracting the cord  but it always seems to get figured out   i m buying a second for travel      love this hair dryer  i m a hairstylist i need a hair dryer that drys hair quickly and light in weight because i have to hold it so much throughout the day  br   i highly recommend  great little hair dryer for traveling with  power is more than adequate for my usage  wish it came in other colors  this is a nice lightweight hair dryer which i appreciate as i have fms and it s hard for me to keep my arms up above my shoulders for any length of time  also like that it doesn t blow my eardrums out  satisfied with it  got it as a gift from my daughters  it s definitely cute and barbie like  it does have an option for 250v or 110v    problem is  when in europe even tho  it was on the 250v setting  both speeds were the same  high and both temperatures were the same  boiling hot  i couldn t put the diffuser close to my scalp as the air was just too hot  when i got back to the states i tried it on 110v and it had two speeds and two temps but still way too warm for a  low  setting  i wasn t able to return it because i d passed the deadline by the time i got back from my trip  i will probably donate this    it doesn t really work overseas unless you want to burn your scalp  it is powerful   effective with defuser   concentrator  i wanted something for traveling but too heavy  folding handle was good  but too big for my use  bought this to replace my old  compact conair 1600   hard to find a small dryer like this that doesn t have a folding handle  has just the right amount of air velocity at each setting  and doesn t come with a lot of   34 frou frou  34  attachments and improvements   this dryer is perfect   simple  efficient  works great   i m happy  i have never paid so much for a blow dryer  but i have no regrets   i feel as if it is so worth it and i get a quick and professional blow out   i expect this to last a very long time  but i would buy another in a heartbeat  quiet  love the retractable core not real lite  hope that will be a sign it will last  but not bulky  a plus for me got dryer pretty quick   my daughter loves it and she has thick long hair   satisfied so far with this product this hair dryer is very light  quieter than some  but still pretty loud on high  i think the high fan setting is a bit fast for styling  but is good for drying hair quickly  the high   hot heat is hot  overall i am satisfied with this dryer and would recommend it  br    br   it arrived when amazon said that it would  works as expected  however  perpetual nightlight is too bright  this was a replacement item  so hopefully it lasts longer than the previous one this is a very nice hair dryer  i like the size  it has a high and low heat which is very comfortable   it s not too noisy which is nice   it can be cleaned too which is very easy  the price is very good i have bought others at twice the price and only half as good  very happy with it  this hair dryer is great and my really loved it as a gift  i would recommend this to all my friends and family i got this hair dryer for mom because her carpel tunnel syndrome had been acting up and her hair dryer had become too heavy for her  this hair dryer is tiny  don t be fooled by it s size though  very powerful for a low watt dryer  it s actually kept her hair healthier from the low watts  though her drying time has remained the same  it s also the perfect travel size hair dryer  heck  it fits in her purse  i liked it so much i bought one for myself as well  it does not come with a  cool shot  setting  which i thought would make achieving curls more difficult  the attachments are tiny as well  so the air does not diffuse much as a regular size hair dryer does  however  because the size is so tiny and light weight it makes styling so much easier and therefore our hair looks better than ever   i don t have to use hot rollers anymore because i can more readily control the direction of air on my hair with each stroke much like my hairdresser  easy to use  easy to store  dries quickly  nice design and fits in with my bathroom d cor  i would definitely buy product again if needed or for a gift  i needed a new blow dryer and because of the good reviews on this one i decided to get it   it works great would definitely recommend it i am a cosmetologist of just about a decade  the main reason that i purchased this dryer was its price  practicality and its brand  andis is one of the leaders in professional clippers in the hair industry  so i figured that i would give this dryer a shot  i have fine normal curly just to about the ears  and this dryer gets it quite straight i must admit that the   34 high velocity  34  air speed is not there  however  the heat is really intense  as a professional  if i had to compare this to a standard salon dryer  performance wise  i would say that it acts a lot like the original chi dryers  low speed  intense heat  with ionic coating to break water molecules up faster  now  that being said  if someone wants a dryer that really blows the water out of the hair  i would recommend  concerning affordability and professional performance  the babyliss 2800   not that weighty and truly cuts drying time  in half  has a 3 year warranty and amazon sells it for half the retail price   br    br   this little andis dryer works great for hair shorter than top of the shoulders  if you have really thick curly or long hair  i would recommend use a t parting in your hair  draw a straight line with a wide toothed comb from the center of your eyebrows  to the back of your neck and comb each section down  from the very top of your head  draw a line from ear to ear to make a lower case  t  on your head  and do your hair in quadrants   clipping them with butterfly clamps helps to keep other sections out of your way  3 5 min extra prep time  but works wonders for straightening effectively  and saves you time in the end  br    br   this dryer does exactly what it says  it  styles  hair  quite nicely might i add the attachments are better than other vertical dryers that i have owned the brush attachment is boar bristle  which allows one to naturally distribute oil through the hair  which is essential to a less frizzy and smoother blow dry  for those who have coarse  thick tightly curled  or all of the above  use the comb attachment that best suits you  and use the brush to set and smooth it in the direction that you would like it to go  this will  mold  your hair  air cool the section that you are working on the cool shot button on any dryer is almost useless  takes too long to cool  by the time it does  the section that you are working on is practically almost ready and is  set   br   overall  this is a four star dryer  it comes with a five year warranty  it s very hot  and it is great for people  like me  who suffer from carp tunnel and arthritis in their hands  at under twenty dollars  this is a great deal  it is nearly impossible to find one locally at that price  especially with a professional brand backing it  thanks again amazon  i find so much great stuff here r all of the above  use the comb attachment that best suits you  and use the brush to set and smooth it in the direction that you would like it to go  this will  mold  your hair  air cool the section that you are working on the cool shot button on any dryer is almost useless  takes too long to cool  by the time it does  the section that you are working on is practically almost ready and is  set   br   overall  this is a four star dryer  it comes with a five year warranty  it s very

price  especially with a professional brand backing it  thanks again amazon  i find so much great stuff here  i m a big fan of panasonic hair dryers and the reason why is simply because they leave my hair looking healthy and shiny   br   fair price and does a great job keeping my hair straight with a bounce and weight in it   i blow dry my hair then use the kurukuru after i spray my hair with a heat protector    p s   my hair type is wavy       excellent power  variety of settings  great price  difuser is perfect for curly hair  if you need a hair dryer  choose this one  my old conair burnt out after about 10 years of use  i debated spending more money on a pricier model  but saw the reviews for more costly hair dryers were hit or total miss  i decided on this dryer  it came with a concentrator nozzle and a diffuser  i ve used both and i love this dryer  it gets the job done  i just wish that the cord was retractable  like my old conair dryer   it s powerful  and it has cooler button  i don t know why  it wash t too hot  but after using it i can smell burns  this is a beautiful chrome gun metal looking dryer with an extra long cord that i love  the first day i got it   i accidentally dropped it in a sink full of water  it was completely submerged  it immediately shut off as soon as it hit the water   i left it to dry and the next day i plugged it in and it worked   i was pretty impressed  this is a great hairdryer and it is very quiet compared to others i ve had  i am very happy with this purchase  i keep it on neutral ions for the most part  i haven t noticed a big difference between the 2 ion settings  but i wasn t expecting to anyway  it seems like a gimmick  i was more concerned with having multiple speeds and heat settings which this has  i had only ever used cheap hairdryers in my life and decided to finally get a good one  i already owned one of their straighteners  so i decided to give their dryer a shot too  they re decently priced and are also a very high quality product  i have super thick hair that normally takes ages to dry all the way  this dryer cuts the time by a significant amount  there is also a free manufacturer warranty on the item  so definitely take advantage of that if you re nervous about trying a brand you don t know  it works well but it takes a lot of room over the outlet  large square plug cover both of them  this is the second one i bought    because my daughter stole my first one    the ease to travel with it is amazing  but i use it every single day   i love that it dries so fast and is so light weight    none of the clunky other driers would ever do now   i am spoiled  this dryer does not blow strong   we need to use the concentrator attachment for it to work at all well   the diffuser is a joke   you might as well blow on your own hair   i bought this to replace my 20 year old misty tone 1500   it is really not any better at all  i ve had a few different hair dryers and by far this is my favorite  fast  powerful  and lite  definitely recommend it  this is a quick drying dryer  which is what we all want  lol   the retractable cord is a little snappy  beware of it flipping the cord against you   i love the color  very bright and cheerful   so far so good  fast shipping   was exactly like the picture   easy to put together and it s quiet you can barely hear it running   mines did come without the screw but i contacted the seller and they quickly sent the parts  so overall it s a pretty good dryer and works great  gets the job done  very good buy  very nice hair dryer  i first got to try this in a hotel in new york  i was amazed at how quickly it dried my hair  i knew i had to get one when i got home  it dries your hair nicely without cooking your head  my old dryer got so hot it was uncomfortable  not this one  i m very happy with my purchase  great price too  this hair dryer has exceeded my standards   i love it when doing my daughter hair she never complained about it being to hot or the comb pulling her hair  after drying the hair it looked fabulous it just blew with the wind bouncy   my daughter loved it   it makes the hair look like you left the salon beautiful     i love it    both my wife and daughter love this hair dryer  they use it weekly without complaining about it which for me sounds great  best blow dryer for your        i have coarse thick long hair    and this blow dryer gets my hair dry in no time  definitely worth it     this dryer is not quiet but the noise is so much more tolerable compared to some dryers that has whistling noise or just super loud   i love that it is foldable and retractable   makes it easier for storage and for traveling  this dryer is very lightweight  quiet and it dries hair quickly  the three heat settings are great and the touch is nice i love it  it works great   i wish it had the ability to regrow hair  since my hair line is receding at an alarming rate though  my old blow dryer just quit on me one day so i ordered this one and it works great   it came with a curling head and a flat head and i have had no issues yet   has good air strength and lets you choose cool  warm or hot  for its size i am amazed at the   34 horsepower  34     the velocity and heat that comes from this thing is amazing and puts full sized hair dryers to shame  this was my best purchase yet  br   the hair dryer straightens as it dries  however  it doesn t burn my hair  br   i am enjoying this hair dryer so much  i m thinking of getting a backup in case something happens to this one     worth five stars just for that  quiet  powerful with several settings and a comfortable ergonomic handle  convenient hook keeps the blow dryer out of our way next to the vanity when not in use  i like this hair dryer because it works quickly  doesn t over dry my hair so there s no damage for using it  and it doesn t weigh much  i have only used it a few times but so far i love it  it heats up and works as good as the one in the beauty shop that i go to  i just hope it will last a long time  i would give it a 5 star if i had it longer than i have  bought this for a 2 week trip to chile   worked well on their 220 volt system though it cannot be used on high heat and high fan when operating on 220   once i got home to the us i moved my current hair dryer to the guest bathroom and am using this one now   it has a strong fan and the heat options are accurate  br    br   the retractable cord and folding handle make it less cumbersome in the suitcase and it s easier to store at home too  looks sheik  works great  and i can see this piece staying with me for a long time   i ve had it for a year and it s still going strong  i really need one of these that goes from 1 4 1 inch barrel as i have very short layered hair i need to and volume and height to and turn curlers to soft waves   i do not want it straight  the original sunbeam wall mounted hair dryer was much better   it was smaller and easier to use   this is ok since i can t find the original just because a hair dryer is pretty and sturdy does not mean i like it  it s very loud and very heavy  also it s very powerful  i have natural curly hair and even with the diffuser it s too powerful and makes may hair frizz  i will be trying the conair curl fusion ionic br   ceramic styler hair dryer because i heard it s better for curly hair and not as heavy or loud  works great and dries hair fast   only complaint is the cord is not long enough for me to plug in my cabinet this hairdryer has adequate heat  but excellent air flow  which i prefer   the higher heat dryers without the airflow just seem to bake your hair dry   the retractable cord is only 4 ft  long  but again that s adequate in most situations  this is a godd little hair blower  no ions  which i don t want since i need bulk  not flat   i gave one to a friend who doesn t have too much money and she loves it too   i m leaving them at my nieces   three  homes so i have a reliable  good hair blower whenever i visit them  this is the best hairdryer i have ever owned   it is worth every penny   i went to my local sally s and bought two they were 35 00 each   i had to buy a new one due to my daughter dropped it and sally s does not have these so i found it on amazon thank goodness   if you drop this dryer it will break easily and there is no repairing it  your hair looks great when you use this one    i will never plan to buy another dryer except this one   i can t say enough love this one so i highly recommend this dryer   this is a great dryer  my first one finally died after 5 years of constant use and i ended up trying a similar gold n hot and it stopped working and overheated on the first use  i quickly ordered the andis and have had no issues  i have long curly hair and it drys  my hair in under 20 min  i will definitely purchase this product a third time once i ve worn the one i just bought out  it s too bad we can t try hair dryers out in the store before purchasing because there is so much to consider when buying one    air flow  heat  weight  noise level  how the attachments fit  etc    and hair dryers that have 5 star reviews still tend to have 1 star reviews as well   how confusing   i finally decided upon the argan heat because no one on amazon rated it below 3 stars   this was the first time i ever bought a hair dryer over  30 00   using the argan heat made me realize that the reason my hair was so dry  fragile and difficult to grow was because my cheap hair dryer was damaging my hair  now my hair dries quickly  feels silky and looks healthy   my complaints about this hair dryer are that the warm setting is barely luke warm   the low speed setting blows too hard  and the concentrator attachment is difficult to screw push on  it does not slide on as the box says    i am not bothered by the weight  and the predominant sound the dryer makes is a pleasant  quiet whoosh  but there is also an underlying straining motor sound that has me concerned   i may end up exchanging this hair dryer before the return date expires in case there s a problem  we had one of these over 18yrs old and it finally gave out   the new one outdoes the previous model  i used this blowdryer in a marriott hotel and fell in love with how quick it dries   so glad i found it on your site   the price is awesome too   nice size  good weight  excellent airflow  great styling my hair  and it s really thick and fairly long  retractable cord is a plus  i have naturally curly hair that tends to be dry as i get older  when i would get a haircut i would always leave the salon with my hair wet because i thought drying it would cause it to be frizzier  my stylist proved me wrong at my last visit  so now that i knew i could dry my hair and it would look good i searched the dryers for curly hair and read all the reviews and chose the conair you  i really like the fact that i can dry my hair and have it look great in about 15 minutes and that s using the low setting  it also comes with a defuser  which is a key to blowdrying curly hair  this is a great little dryer for naturally curly hair  this product had been used and packaged up  the dryer does not get hot and the low speed is not very low  i will be returning the item  i liked the weight but the controls rub my hand badly small and light weight  quiet  relative to our old one which was loud through the bathroom door  on low fan speed  it s very quiet  especially with the bathroom door closed  good value at  14 bucks for the white one  black one is 22 bucks for some reason   update  after  14 months  the on off switch started to malfunction  it s sticky and engages sometimes but mostly doesn t  knocking off a star from 4 star to 3 star  this apparently is a common complaint  i took it apart to see if anything can be done but the flip switch itself needs to be replaced and i haven t found a suitable replacement since no part number is indicated  for the price  i ll probably just buy another because it s what works best for us in terms of power  quiet and weight  i ve owned this blow dryer for at least 7 or more years   i can t remember how long i ve had this blow dryer exactly  but i know i bought it when my daughter was a baby   she s almost 9   the best blow dryer ever   the button to retract cord fell off last year   no big deal   i need to finally replace it because it is starting to make noises when i use it   price is just an added bonus   this is an excellent hair dryer and a well made product   however  be advised   the owner s manual manufacturer s warranty included with the product  and the manufacturer s web site  both clearly state that the normal 1 year product warranty is void if the product is purchased from amazon  this hair dryer is extremely affordable  especially when compared to other brand hair dryers of equal ability   this dryer is easy to use and is great for any female in your life  i would really like the hose to be longer   if you are standing up doing your makeup you have to be really careful to not pull the hose out of the bonnet   you also need to be careful to not pull the whole thing onto the floor   the dryer on hot gets way too hot   even on medium it gets very hot   i ve wound up using it on the cool setting   one good thing  the bonnet really is a nice big one  dries hair quickly   excellent price   i have 15 amp service  and it doesn t blow fuses   it should blow a fuse on high  given the watt rating  but it doesn t   go figure  i love this product so far  the heat setting is just perfect for me because i have natural hair  i put it to my desired heat setting and it dries my hair great without the heat damage and the comb attachment doesn t pull on my hair  it glides right through while it dries  i gave it 5 stars because i haven t experienced any flaws yet  hopefully it lasts longer  it arrive on time i like how it looks and is a good hair dryer for my hair and the price is great i wanted a smaller dryer for traveling and that would dry my curly hair fast   this is a fantastic dryer   my hair is curly and midlength and it dries in 7 minutes   and it does a fantastic job of smoothing it out  even on my worse days   i love it  what can you say  it is a good product and does exactly what i wanted   there are no bells and whistles  but i m traveling   i wanted something collapsable and easy to carry   although it s a tiny bit larger than i had hoped for  it is still better than my at home dryer  seems like a great top of the line hair dryer  well built  i would recommend to anyone  beats the department store models hands down  this is a little dryer  but for the price  it should offer more  for example  the air flow seems to come out of the unit at a strange angle  i ve used the dryer for several weeks and i still haven t figured out how to make the most of the air  the temperature of the air is fine  and velocity is as expected for a 1600 watt unit  the direction is off  i was a bit disappointed by the knob to switch the voltage  you need a coin to turn the selection  and the plastic is so cheap that it was immediately  and permanently  gouged  if this unit cost  10  like some at target  i would expect that  but this is priced in a way that one expects better quality  i don t think i d buy this unit again  for some time now i ve been searching for a more quiet hair dryer and i have finally found it   i love that this dryer is so quiet i can blow dry my hair even after everyone has gone to sleep  at 75db it is perfect and it is a lower frequency as well which helps keep it quiet  br    br   i also love the ionic technology  my husband   i were a bit skeptical about this feature  but now that i ve tried it i m a believer  with the ionic generator turned off my hair does gain volume but it also tangles really easily  with the ionic generator turned on the tangles disappear and my hair gets really smooth and soft  it s also helping with my split ends  br    br   the 3 heat seatings are great too  i believe the manufacture claims the lowest setting is a cool 62 f and the hottest is approximately 223 f  it gets really hot  but it s great that you can use the cool shot feature to   34 set  34  you style when done  br    br   bottomline  quietest dryer i ve ever used and totally worth the money too  the retractable cord  the compact size  and the power are awesome  so is the price  it just needs a proper nozzle  i had a more expensive ceramic hair dryer but after taking it apart to clean hair out of it i couldn t get it back together quite right   so i bought this one   i like it because it s much lighter in weight but i m also worried that that means it s cheaper quality   but so far so good   it blows plenty of hair and gets plenty hot  but this is a good thing as long as you keep it moving   if you want to aim it at one part of your head without moving it  just turn the heat level down a bit  i have been looking for a great blow dryer and actually the salon i go to the uses this dryer   my hairdresser told me that it s a very good blow dryer and it does not damage your hair like the other dryers   this turbo 3200 dryer dries my hair very quickly and i am happy with the end result  br    br   i recommend this dryer to anyone who is looking for a really good dryer   it s a little expensive  but who cares if it s going to give great results then it s worth the money  for those who have said that it s a bit heavy for them  they are correct  i do wish it was lighter  however it is not that heavy  and it dries my hair so quickly  some people have said that the cool shot button is in a difficult place  i have not found that  i think it is very easy to use  in all   i m very happy with this dryer  i like the curling hair dryer and am getting used to using it  my hair requires constant care because i have no natural curl and have very fine hair  i think a person with some natural wave or curl and thicker hair than mine would find this a marvelous curling hair dryer  i do keep using it every other day and use a regular curling iron in between to redo my hair  this curling hair dryer by far beats every other curling hair dryer i have used  took this dryer on my cruise and it works very well on my long br   blond hair  br   it is compact and fits right in my suitcase or overnight bag withouth taking br   too much space  my hair stylist had recommended it  after i told her it seemed to take forever to dry my hair at home  yet minutes in her salon  it s a great product  and not as high pitched as other dryers i ve had  the only reason i didn t give this hair dryer 5 stars is because i love a retractable cord  its a pain to have the cord always in the way   otherwise i love it especially  for this price  my hair dryes very fast and looks very healthy  this dryer is excellent  it gets hotter then the ones in the salon  best  104 ever spent  i recommended it to all my friends and fam  i love having my hair dryer ready for action whenever i need it  br   conair is an excellent product   i love it  i love how lightweight this thing is  while still being powerful   i gave it to my mom for christmas  and when i m home  i usually go into her bathroom to use it because it s better than mine  i needed new hair dryers for upstairs and downstairs bathrooms and didn t want to pay too much  i don t do a lot of styling  mostly just wash and dry  so i didn t need a lot of attachments  this one suited me perfectly  it dries my hair quickly and leaves it smooth  br   my old dryer was a conair and worked well for years  i hope this one lasts as long  br   to anyone looking for a nice simple hair dryer  reasonably priced  i would recommend this one  it would be the perfect hair dryer if it weren t so loud   i d buy it again because of its size and quality this product works good for drying my hair quickly  it is very hot and drys my hair very fast but it is noisy and loud  this hair dryer functions really well  it is strong and hot enough  and it can also be cool  it is pretty light and doesn t vibrate in hand  i recommend it  silent   don t believe it  so high pitched it hurts my ears  and when it comes to blowing  and drying  mediocre at best  i threw it away  dries my hair very quickly  and dries it straight  i have wavy hair and this hairdryer gets the wave out if i want to  this is a must  i have thin naturally curly hair and i didn t want to damage my hair with a blow dryer that was gonna be too rough on me  i gave this one a try and omg the diffuser and heat settings are perfect  i still have to use it for straightening  i m sure its gonna be perfect though i used this dryer in italy  they have a higher current  so i m glad i read the directions  i set the dial to the correct current  and only used low setting  it was quite powerful  and dried my hair in an equal amount of time as my full sized dryer at home  br   also  it comes with a little diffuser that works well  how cute  i would recommend this dryer  works great  i have very thick hair and it dries it quickly  fast delivery and item was as described  i have purchased both  this conair model 223np and the andis model 81290 hair dryer  the andis is more feature packed  see my separate review   the conair is a bit quieter than most hair dryers i ve owned including the andis model  i used a db digital sound meter to measure the difference  the conair was only 76db vs  83db from the andis model with the sound meter set at 8 inches from the side of the dryers  the conair is packed with 1875 watts which is more than enough to dry long thick hair  there are 2 heat settings  low   high  and a cool setting  the cool setting is the same temperature as when using the cool shot button  no heat at all   the air intake on the back is a 1 3 4 inch round opening covered by a removable lint screen  the opening is a bit small when compared to the andis model which is larger at 2 3 8 inches and has side air intakes as well  this begs the question of reliability of the conair because overheating of the motor is a prone problem of all hair dryers and with a small air intake opening on the conair model  this could cause more heat build up of the motor  only time will tell  the unit has 2 blower speeds  although i wish it had 3 for more versatility  the velocity of airflow without the concentrators attached is nearly the same for both models  air temperature at maximum is 162 degrees on the conair and 198 degrees on the andis using a digital temperature probe set at 3 inches from the nozzel without the concentrator attached  all be it both models will dry your hair quickly and satisfactory  the retractable cord is nice and measures 5 feet   3 inches with 5 1 2 inches that does not retract into the handle  the retracter is a bit stronger than the andis model but it will still require you to help feed the cord all the way to its end  the dryer does come with a 3 year warranty but the andis model comes with a generous 5 year warranty  both the conair and the andis models weigh nearly the same and the ergonomics are virtually the same   my favorate choice between the two models is the andis because of the longer warranty and the design   feature advantages it has over the conair  see my separae review  but given all the features of the conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment  i give it a solid 3 5 stars favorate choice between the two models is the andis because of the longer warranty and the design   feature advantages it has over the conair  see my separae review  but given all the features of the conair model and its stylish color and includes a defuser attachment  i give it a solid 3 5 stars  very light weight and quiet  but controls are on the handle and are sharp    have to hold it at the very bottom of the handle so not to switch the settings  and smells like burning plastic    got this for my gf for christmas and she couldn t be happier   she likes how quiet it is and the extra piece on the end of it   not sure what that s called or what it s used for but all that matters is that she s happy  i have fine hair  but a lot of it  that is very prone to frizzing   this dryer really helps keep it straight without frying it   i was using a chi rocket  and this is much easier for me to use  this is a great dryer for this price range   i owned one that died  didn t know about the 3 yr warranty  so i tossed it  bummer   and bought a rusk speed freak  retail  120  after several of my friends raved about it   however  after only a week of using that one   i ve returned it and ordered another one of these  this is better than teh speed freak and only costs a fraction of the price  worked fine when i first receive it  last night  after normal home usage  it burned out and is only fit for the garbage  my hair is very dense and attracts static very quickly   my usual blowdryer  and all the others i ve owned in the past  left my hair dry but pieces of my hair sticking straight up and i d always have to use a smoother to tame them   thankfully i showered at a friend s house one day and borrowed this dryer   i came out of the bathroom and my friend was like omg your hair looks amazing   no flyaways   no static   my hair looked better after just drying it than it usually did after i spent 30 minutes styling it  br    br   i immediately ordered this on amazon prime ten minutes later and tossed my old dryer as soon as it came in   i have since bought two more for my best friends  and they swear by it as well  i have many fancy and expensive hair dryer but i fell in love with this one when i was staying in the ritz carlton hotel  i notice that it is foldable  drys fast  and not too hot  just everything i needed for a hair dryer  so i ordered this one from amazon and i have been using this for years  still works great  i love this blow dryer    it doesn t get to hot and it s easy to hold and use    i would buy from this seller again i have re ordered this product because it is light weight  powerful  reasonably priced and my wife wanted one  i highly recommend this product  makes my hair nice and soft  glad i ordered it and would recommend it to anyone who has curly unruly hair  thanks kathy bought this combination hair dryer  hit air curler for use when i am in japan   it worked perfectly for my fine hair   maybe i did pay a premium for buying it in the us  but i did not have take time out of my business or pleasure schedule to find one when i got to japan   i highly recommend this for any woman who plans to travel in japan and wants a combinatuion hair dryer and hair curler good product   looks lilke its well made and easy to hankle   only knock is its a little heavy   otherwise well worth the money  this dryer is awesome   very sturdy and well made   gives my thin hairs lots of volume   it would be perfect if the handle folder after it retracted the cord   it s a minor complaint for such a good dryer though  we have owned two of these hair dryers and each of them functioned for just over a year  coincidentally  a few months past the return window    we loved the fact that these fit nicely on the wall  are easy to access and keep the bathroom organized   however  both hair dryers shorted out and you could see sparks inside the barrell when turned on   the second one had smoke rising from it and continued to emit noises after we unplugged it   these hairdryers were only lightly used by adults and were not dropped or mishandled   the first time it happened  we figured it was just bad luck  but not the 2nd time   there are several other reviews for hairdryers from this company that report similar malfunctions   we won t be buying a 3rd time and will try another wall mount brand that hopefully isn t as hazardous  the heat is super strong  so i would advise people to be careful  some hair types can handle heat better than others  but heat in general isn t the best for your hair  i personally like it  i have transitioning hair  relaxed to natural african american hair  it s extremely wavy  coily and stubborn   so the heat really helps me a lot  i am replacing a unit i bought over 10 years ago   the high setting burned out  and the low setting is not hot enough nor fast enough for me   i think this is a gret little dryer and i like the neat wall mount  i love this dryer  this is my third one  i have purchased more expensive ones and this one is still better  the air flow is more directed so i get smooth hair without fly aways like so many new dryers  it has a good temp as well  i use the comb attachment and my hair is dry and full of volume in record time   much better product than i expected  we were very pleased with this purchase  the dryer works good and it is very convient to have it so close at hand  love it i have very thick and frizzy hair     i love the multiple speeds and the heat settings that it has  i wish it was a little lighter   i can deal with that though     i love it     after i blow dry my hair i barely need to straighten it  reduces the frizz greatly    comes with the two adapters pieces which work great  i purchased this item because of the retractable cord   it is a powerful hair dryer but not too heavy   i also purchased the scalpmaster hair dryer holder so i could keep it on my counter top   i would recommend this dryer  after using this hair dryer at a marriott on our way home  she just had to have one   compact  variable heat and blower settings  just what she wanted   fair price including the extra for shipping   she s quite pleased and that s what it s all about   even the retractable cord is neat  does a great job and can t beat the price   i can t believe the difference it makes between my old hair dryer and this one  this dryer is nice and quiet and is very similar to my old vidal sasson quiet style vs750 dryer   i like the controls as they are easer to use with the push style versus the slide style of button   very happy to have this after trying two other dryers   the other two were either too loud or to strong   i have very fine hair and i don t need a hair dryer that can basically blow my head off of my shoulders   i don t see anywhere on the box that it is by vs but if it is  i am very glad as i had the vs750 for 14 years and hope i have this one for a long time  good hairdryer   does its job and is good for the price  not the strongest or hottest dryer out their  but dries hair quickly and easily and has settings to control temp  the hair dryer itself is a great dryer for the price  i had owned one for 6 years before it broke  so i bought another one  but this one is a revised model of the original one i bought when these first came out  and they have considerably shortened the length of the cord  very bad for  salon use or if your outlet is more then two feet away  other then that i have no complaints about this product  we cruise a lot  and this blow dryer is perfect  it s powerful  yet portable  br   i love the folding handle  what a space saver  thank you the hose needs to be a little bit longer  heat is good and dries good but just too short on hose  it s very cute and light on the pockets  i m loving it soo far  it s a thumbs up for me  br   don t overthink it  just get it  says it s perfect for traveling  and she loves the cold temp button for when she doesn t want the high heat  smaller than it looks but a powerful hair dryer for the size  it was about as powerful as a 1500 watt dryer i use daily  great for traveling and putting in a suitcase because it is about 1 3 the size  it has a little carrying case too that is nice for the price     if you need a smaller dryer that packs a punch for travel  i bought this hair dryer as a gift for my daughter  i also own one and so does my other daughter  we absolutely love this hair dryer  it has 3 speed settings  low  med  high   2 temperature settings  low  high   and a cool button  it is nicely powered with each setting and very nicely made  i ve had mine for a few years now and the reel cord still works as well as it did the day i purchased it  if you are considering buying this product i would highly recommend it   works great   not too heavy  love the retractable cord   feel good knowing it is ionizing and ceramic for the safety of my hair  won t return this  but it seems a little wobbly and doesn t work particularly well with my beth room outlets   the folding mechanism doesn t seem to lock the the unfolded position   good power and blowing temps  i purchased this product about a month ago   it had good air flow  although i had hoped for more since my travel hair dryer surpasses it in air volume   however  i thought it was sufficient  then it just stopped working after about 3 weeks  it was still within the time frame of being returnable  so i did return it and amazon has refunded me   i will not repurchase  this hair dryer actually works really well   great size  great price  great product  except it sucks your hair in the back and it hurts   my last dryer never did this  but this one does it all the time  several times while i m drying it   it s so annoying and hurts   i actually have to hold my hair back with my hand so it won t get sucked into the vortex of pain   i would never buy this dryer again  good quality  drys quickly without frying your hair   not as noisy as some dryers   light weight  sturdy   it seems like it will last   i would recommend it  my old 1500 watt dryer gave up after 10 years of extreme use  i was working at that time so it got daily use and it was a super hairdryer  i looked for another one just like it but to no avail   i found this 1600 watt one and since the low wattage in this style with the long barrel are difficult to find  i purchased 2  i no longer work outside the home and only use this every 2 days   and my hair is shorter  so i expected it to last longer than 9 months  today when i turned on the unit and dried my hair all was okay but when i went to turn off the unit  the on off switch locked up and then smoke came billowing out of that area  i quickly unplugged it and tossed it out the door should flames start coming out of the unit  now i am apprehensive on using the second one i purchased  for 25 00 each  i would have expected it to last longer  br    br   as for drying my hair  it was a good hair dryer  i had this dryer for years and they don t sell it in the stores around me any more so i was so happy when i found it on amazon   love this dryer it does such a nice job with my curls  i ordered an extra one for the future  my daughters dryer died so she took my extra to use until she could replace hers  well she loves it so much she just ordered two more one for me and a backup for herself  i wish i hadn t thrown away the packaging for this  because i would be returning it  i ve never had a hair dryer that didn t get hot  this is a first  it s a pleasure hold this dryer in your hands  powerful yet elegant  i have had many of different dryers  this one is worth more than the price  its works good  this is my 1st dryer so donno what to expect n all   works for for me  so far so good   using it from almost 1 year for now   no complaints     at first it was great  but after about 6 months the dryer randomly stopped working and now  not even a year old has stopped working completely    love the dryer   salon quality   powerful  but easy to handle   i m glad there is also a cool setting to finish off the styling  is the perfect size for my teenage niece   she loved the color  settings and temperatures   would be a good hairdryer for any non professional  was on a business trip and this was the hair dryer in my room at the jw marriott in indianapolis   loved it so i got on amazon and ordered one  it was waiting on my porch after i got home   small  yet powerful and i like that i can control both the heat level and the air flow level   a great dryer for travelling  this is amazing  it really is quiet  it looks great on the wall too   very efficient  i have been using an older model and this br   very powerful but so quiet  it has the hi and low and it s so comfortable to hold for this grandma    i love the added feature  the little side hook that holds the cord up once the dryer is snapped back in the holder you have thought of everything  i have this same hair dryer in the purple pink shade  and got this for my mom as a gift  br    br   i ve had my hair dryer for about three months now and i use it daily  and it s still going strong  it is a powerful hair dryer  and yes  it is loud but it has a low setting if that bothers you  br    br   i don t see what the hype is about this dryer being really heavy as i ve read all over the reviews  it s not light but certainly not weighing my arm down either  it cuts my drying time literally in half  so who cares  the  cool shot  button works really well which was also a huge plus for me  this dryer has a cartridge that is very easy to remove hair from so that it won t fail as easily  overall  it s a solid product and i ve been very happy with mine  br    br   side note  conair will replace within four years if this breaks if you call them  which sealed the deal for me for a  30 dryer  i called and asked conair about this directly before i purchased mine through amazon  it doesn t matter it s through a third party  i bought for my wife and she is really happy with this blower  i strongly recommends this blower  go and buy one i didn t realize how great this hair dryer was until i went on vacation without it  my hair was so dry and icky  i couldn t wait to get home to use it  i will never leave home without it  worth the money  great product  works like it says  1  i can now say i own the worlds smallest ferrari  br   2  this hair dryer lives up to the hype   br   not going to lie  i was skeptical at first   i hadn t purchased a hair dryer in over a decade and the price was a little hard to swallow   after some reseach and all of the fantastic reviews i decided to go for it   i am so glad that i did   this hair dryer doesn t get scorching hot but gets hot enough and has power like no other   my hair feels softer after using it and i don t even need to use the straightener afterwards   i personally don t have a problem with the weight of the hair dryer and it s no louder than any other hair dryer i ve used   if anything i think it s slightly quieter than most   what used to take about 12 minutes to blow dry my hair now takes 5 minutes  literally 5 minutes or less from wet to dry   the first time i used it i timed it at 4 minutes 20 seconds     it is absolutely incredible and saves me so much time   beyond happy i bought this and i would easily recommend to anyone  this product was a great investment  three clients love it s power and heat  i love it  please buy this product  thank you thank you thank you for making a hair dryer with a retractable cord   i cannot express how wonderful this feature in particular is   the jury is still out on the dryer itself as i ve not had it long enough to know its durability reliability  but so far so good  really small  but does a good job of drying  i just wish there was a diffuser  my other conair one kinda fits so i use it  but it falls on the floor sometimes  packs enough power nice   compact  i would recomend this hair dryer to any one especiallly if they travel    amazing price for a great performing product   quiet  br    br   ships on time from a great vendor   now is the time to upgrade your outdated hair dryer  my old  reliable hair blower was dying  and i looked around for something similar   i found the andis  and it s great   light weight  very important  and terrific drying capability   mater of fact  i bought it before my other one died  so it was in the ready   great choice for a hair blower  the dryer is working fine so far  there s no question that it is top heavy and the bottom part is more flimsy than i would like  i move it around with care and support it with both hands  for the price i expected to be so  in the future  if i adapt to it  i might fiddle with the design and make it more stable  do not expect wonders  i like the color  the attachments  and the retractable cord  i didn t feel like the hair dryer was too heavy or too loud  if you blow dry your hair on high then yes it is loud but if you use the lower setting it is actually pretty quiet  i d buy this again  i think it was a great value for the price  i love everything about this blow dryer it drys without getting too hot on warm  ligth weight  the attachments and size  i just dont like the buttons they seem like it going to fall off when i turn thw blow dryer on and off  but it works like a dream so i just be careful i already own this hair dryer for a year and it is still working fine  it is small  light weight  does not tire your hand and blows just the right amount of air  i highly recommend it  i first used it at a hotel and then bought one for my personal use  i am glad i did  i used it in france for over a year and it works amazing  unlike the other dryers that my friends used in france with converters this little think held up amazing and kept its power  this hairdryer has great power and different heat settings  the price and quality are great  it is very heavy duty  the automatically recoiling cord is a bonus  i agree with another reviewer who noted how big and heavy this dryer was   i didn t even take it out of the package  ended up returning it on my own dime  bought this to replace an old one that finally expired after about 4 years  there are were a few minor issues  first the power cord is much shorter than the previous one which necessitated remounting to a different wall location  had to paint the wall to cover the repaired area  second  there needs to be a way to dim or turn off the night lite  it is so bright you can make moves with it  a 4 1 2 star unit  5 with light control and going back to a longer cord  i did not enjoy this product   it was almost too powerful   yes there is such a thing   the previous bed head bh407 model was great  why mess with a good thing   returned  i am really picky about hair dryers since i have long very think hair  i used the new dryer this morning and my hair dried quick and frizz free  it usually takes me 45 minutes to blow dry my hair and it only took 25 minutes  so happy   i just got it  but so far so good  i keep my hair high and tight so i m not drying long hair but it is thick hair  like a rug you know  it takes 2 3 minutes to dry my hair with this dryer  it has sufficient heat on low for my hair so if you put it on high it s probably overkill  the balance and weight is good as well   i ve always bought conair brand and my last one would probably still be alive if it hadn t got broken by our movers  for  11 and amazon s return policy i figured i couldn t go wrong and so far i m happy with the product  i d buy it again  great product  easy to install and easy to clean the filter  works very well  br    br   thanks much  br   dean huey br   columbus  nebraska this is an excellent blow dryer  as it dries extremely quickly and creates a smooth  frizz free shine  my hair is a medium bob style and  the rotating straightening piece is perfect for creating a stylish look  great purchase  i expect this item to last quite a while  as cheaper quality driers die on me after 2 years  the motor is quieter than dryers i ve owned in the past  easy to operate  love the cord reel  does a fast job of drying my hair  may be old style but works like it should   finally one that won t die every 16 months  i love it one of the best purchase  i also love the color  quick and easy to use  the price is also just right  i thought i may of overpaid for just a hair dryer   but this product works very well   it is effecient   drys hair quickly and makes my hair shine   friends   family that use it also notice a positive difference  conair 1875 watt pro style hair dryer is nicely balanced for wrist and arm movement to personally dry quickly long hair   i wash and dry every other day and so far it seems gentle  along with good hair health product    it reminds me of eighties hand held hair dryers only feels and sounds better than mine ever did before   also the color blends nicely with medium wood rustic style  i bought this hairdryer after reading the reviews  i was going to buy a more expensive one but after reading the reviews decided to give this a try  it was worth it  it works better than a more expensive one i had prior to this one  it dries my hair very quickly and gives it a nice full body look  i highly recommend this hair dryer  for the price you can t beat it  overall this hairdryer does the job well  its 1875 and powerful will dry hair quickly   i have two issues with this dryer   1   the air concentration nossel is wide and does not attach well to the hairdryer therefore any slight bump with either your hand or your brush will make it fly off and it does so at least 3 times when i m drying my hair  its really irritating and 2   the cool shot button is right at the top of the handle where i usually hold the hair dryer this makes it akward to hold because i dont want the cool shot button on to i have to hold the dryer at the bottom of the handle  i have 2 other blow dryers  and i will be selling them   this dryer is without a doubt the best i have ever had  it is really awesome this is why i gave it a 5  i would indeed tell others that this is the dryer to own  i have very thick  wavy hair  and i burn through  literally  big box hair driers every 6 months   i bought this drier 2 1 2 years ago  and it s still going strong   i love it   it s hot enough that i can straighten my hair with a large paddle brush and without using my straightening iron   this is by far the best hair drier i ve ever had  this dryer is really fast and does a nice job of making my hair already pretty smooth before having to flatiron it  i used one of these at a marriott once  and thought it was a great little dryer  it folds up nicely and works great for my daily use at home  temperature and blowing options are perfect for me  i literally have no complaints  especially for a  20 product  good price on this dryer with the excellent option of a built in cord reel   we will see how long that holds up   couple of issues i disliked about this product was the weight seems a bit heavy  wish it was a bit quieter  and also doesn t seem like the air blows very hot   seems to take longer to dry my hair compared to my older model  just like the other reviews andis works beautifully  i can get straighter hair now with only my blowdryer and the cool shot is a bonus thank you the dryer does actually work  it has a inside setting to automatically shut itself off to prevent overheating  worked great from me without shutting off who knew all hair dryers were not created equal   great price for a hair dryer that doesn t fry your hair  br    br   i have super thick hair and this dryer cuts my dry time in half compared to my last old cheap dryer  br    br   price is good  great product  cord disappears  this one is just fine   my sister was visiting and said   34 that s the shortest hair dryer cord i ve ever seen   34  until i showed her how it retracks and pulls out at will   decent hairdryer decent price  i like this because of the three speed settings and three heat settings   i just like having the options   i also like that the cord is fairly long   some are just too short and you have to stay so close to the outlet   i will say  though  if you like your dryer to get super hot this may not be the one for you   it does get really warm but not   34 burn your skin  34  hot like some of them   i m happy with it  this is my second twin turbo and i truly love it   it is pricey compared to retail dryers but its performance is outstanding  it gives my hair volume and never over dries   i highly recommend this product  this works great  was brand new in the box  i used all the time   i was very happy with this product powerful and has a really hot setting  a warm setting and button for   34 cool  34  which has no heat at all   it s very good and i m very pleased   my last conair of a similar model is still going strong after many years and we ve used to to defrost the freezer when it was broken for a few months  had to defrost it every week   and i used it as my own hairdryer and as a dog grooming dryer  which is now it s exclusive use  i have a dog grooming business    so these are workhorse machines  you kept telling me you were preparing it for shipment  and that i would get it on the estimated date   i did receive it on that date  but it would have been nice is you had promptly sent it out  i could have had it sooner   my old dryer quit working   so had to wait for you to prepare shipment  whatever that is    i have used this  along with another dryer a few times  and it seems ok  i usually use this and another dryer  both together  i got two different shapes so they can both fit in my hand  together   my dog wasn t terrified by it when i used it to help dry her   so  if it s ok with her  it s fine with me  the hair dryer that i received does not match the description  first of all  it does not look new  does not have a folding hand  and it s blue  i like it more than the one i have   i wish it had 6 settings through low med high and cool warm hot  that would make it better  then i would love it  to be fair  i knew it didn t have all of those settings when i bought it  i have not gone to europe with it yet  i ll see if the electricity conversion truly works then  i have used this  along with another dryer a few times  and it seems ok   i really can t say that the ionic action it s supposed to do does much for my hair  since i usually use both together  i got two different shapes so they can both fit in my hand  together   my dog wasn t terrified by it when i used it to help dry her   so  if it s ok with her  it s fine with me  when i was staying at a four star hotel  a marriott i believe  this hair dryer was in the bathroom   i liked it   i made a note of the model number  and i ordered it from amazon   it is a great dryer   i use it every day and  when traveling  i have yet to find a dryer in a hotel that does the job as well as this one  doesn t fry my hair like my last blow dryer  easy to store with retractable cord  it has a number of settings as well  great buy  got great rating from good morning america   the reason i bought it   i have 4a b natural hair and i don t like to use direct heat  blow dryer flat iron  on it very often  i ordered the dryer because i often don t have the time to wait around for my hair to air dry after washing conditioning and styling  this dryer is great  it was easy to assemble and seems to be durable  the tempature and timer settings work well  it get s the job done  very nice little blow dryer  i have short hair and it dries my hair in minutes  both speeds work great and it is light weight   only draw back the cord is a little too short  other than that it is perfect as a hairstylist i have used many drying tools and nothing compares to this dryer   i will never use another the famous chi including   chi doesn t come close to this one     and the cost you just can t beat it   i had  my first twinturbo for about 10 years roughly  it hasn t completely quit on me yet but showing signs of getting tired so i m buying another because i will not work without this dryer   it will not disappoint    hint  nothing manages frizz except products   so don t think a dryer is going to eliminate frizz because that s nonsense  great product  br   i just love my purchase  i always end up as a happy customer  of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by amazon  a month after receiving this dryer there was a problem with the switch when operated in the high position   to make it operate you physically have to hold the switch in the high position  wife said  she would use it and deal with the problem instead of being without a  hair dryer   other wise it performs as a hair dryer  first discovered this at a hotel we were staying at and was impressed by the output so much that we ordered one before we checked out  i needed a replacement dryer   this does the job  it s super light  and cute looking   at first i didn t think i would like it because it seemed really lacking in power   however  it dries hair extremely quickly  so the lack of power isn t an issue  this was a purchase to replace my old dryer   which was the exact same brand type   of nearly 10 years  one morning it just stopped heating up  so i hurried to the store for another  but couldn t find anywhere  thank goodness for amazon     my old one was boring gray  so i really enjoy the new bright colorful look  and i did try other brands  which i returned  as no other dryer ever got hot enough to straighten my frizzy hair  so i m really glad i was able to find an exact match here  very noisy with limited heating functions  i have only owned this dryer for a week and the cord keeper function is already hit or miss  i used this while vacationing with a friend and it was the first thing i came home and bought   great power  easy to hold and store  the first days love it     i didn t use it every day  just 1 day every other week    after 2 months  it started to smell burned and didn t turn on     it is trash    it is powerful and easy to use   dry the hair in 2 3 minutes  my hair is about 2 inches long    great product  i absolutely love this little dryer  it is so manageable to use   i did buy it because of an injury to my arm  only allowing me a limited range of motion   i was concerned as to how i could possibly use a hair dryer   this one certainly fit the bill   it is lightweight  and dries my hair in such a short time   it also comes with attachments and a nice little case  for me  it works better than any heavy  bulky one i have used before  i thought that hair dryers are just that   hair dryers  this is not your standard hair dryer   it can basically style your hair without applying any gel or styling products on your hair  it is that amazing  and it keeps the style of your hair for the rest of the day  i ve had this dryer for 2   years  the latch that keeps the hood upright has finally warped and doesn t stand open  otherwise  it heats nicely and evenly and the ion feature leaves my hair shiny  it was so good that i refuse to buy another  i just rigged it with some flexi rods to get the hood to stay open and upright  yep  it s just that good  i had this exact same hair dryer   purchased at a retail store   for years   when looking for a new one  i bought this one again on amazon  this is the best travel dryer i have used  and i have bought many  only negative   it isn t dual voltage so it won t work in countries with 240 volt wiring  the pros  br   it will work for travel  small enough to fit in your hand br   it has a switch you can turn with your fingernail or a screwdriver 125 to 250v br   cost br    br   the cons  br   it s made of cheap plastic  the folding handle feels like it s going to break when i fold it  br   it s really noisy  the pitch will hurt your ears  br   it didn t even remotely blow hot air  essentially  you re blow drying on a lukewarm cool setting br    br   follow up  i ended up buying a br   conair you reel 2 in 1 folding handle hair dryer which i love  it worked perfectly in the uk with a 10 amp converter and my hair looked so much better than when it did using this blow dryer  it dries all this hair really fast   very light   bigger than i thought due to it s weight but it works   love it  i only used it once but so far so good  very comfortable and easy to maneuver to multitask  great product  love my new dryer  much better that the ones i ve had before  i like that you can adjust the temperature  i don t put a lot of fuss into my hair  but recently we moved to a much different climate  hot and humid   since i didn t want to wait all day for my hair to mostly dry  i wanted to pick up a cheap hair dryer  for the price  this one is fantastic  the hot setting is a bit hot  but aren t they all   but the cool setting is really strong  so i use that most often  for all the power it puts out  the dryer is small too  which is great  br   if i had to make a complaint  it would be that the cord could be longer  and it isn t coiled so it doesn t stretch at all  arrived quickly  works great and has all the features i need  amazing how cheap you can get a good hair dryer these days  great seller and product  it is a really good and strong blow dryer which last a long time it is a really good brand very good for long hair the dryer as advertised on this picture is the one i have  the wats is 1300 which not 1875 like other dryers  it s better for ur electric bill  it s veryyyyy hot on the hot setting  so i think medium setting is best where it s still hot but bearable  the cool setting feels mediocre cool  and the burst is actually cold  let me tell u  ive had this dryer at least 2 yrs  i used it an entire winter season to warm up a 15x16 room  it ran 6 hrs straight every day  n the motor died at the end of the season  i wouldn t recommend this b done  it s was just my experience with this dryer  just letting u know its a strong dryer long lasting if used the correct way  it s not light weight  but very well built  it s had many hard falls to the floor over the yrs  also it has a safety feature on the plug housing to not turn on if theres an electrical feed interference in a socket  to reset it just press the bottom on the plug   im shopping for the same one  very nice  color and design especially with very very low noises so that you can use it in the early morning will recommend friends to have it  i purchased the leopard print babyliss nano titanium portofino 6600 hair dryer   it definitely cuts the drying time for my hair   i am glad that the  cool  setting is indeed that  cool air  not just unheated air   my hair has appeared shinier with less frizz   i am very happy with this purchase  great dryer   i use attachment so my hair doesn t blow all over place  dries hair quick  looks good  hope it lasts forever  it is a little noisy  but works well with strong wind  the price is attractive and it has good quality this is my third favorite  first is the sedu and second is the parlux  this is great for the price however  i had a dryer like this and after 4 years it died  hard to find one like it  but amazon had it  perfect for drying thick wavy hair  this works so much better for me than the 2000 watt ion dryers  they frizz my hair  hard to find a   34 regular  34  dryer  thank younamazon   this hairdryer work exactly like it was described  all features work as expected  comfortable to hold  not to loud and cord retracts just fine  would definitely recommend  powerful blow dryer  i love it  i use it for my hair and i use it after giving my poodle and maltese a bath  i highly recommend this blow dryer  will purchase again from this seller  so far so good  i ve only had this product for about a month now and so far it does what it is suppose to do  this hair dryer very handily keeps the dryer out of the way and the is very conveniently located on the wall near my vanity  this little baby is awesome  i got it primarily to take with me when i travel  but now i use it at home instead of my regular hair dryer  it gets really hot  but not so hot that it has singed my hair or anything   and it has a lot of power for such a small blow dryer  very lightweight too  love it  our first conair lasted 7 years of daily rigorous use  this replacement is a clone in every respect and fits the bill  compact  lightweight and powerful  the price is right as well  worked ok for a year and then the high setting crapped out also a bit in the heavy side i guess a percentage will be lemons like mine i tried this blow dryer at a hotel and loved it  i ordered it when i got home and was not disappointed  this blow dryer is powerful and does the job efficiently  i was looking for a quiet hair dryer that worked well   this one is perfect   a little difficult to work the buttons one handed at first  but i m sure that i just have to get used to it     i recommend it without reservation  i will never go back to a hair dryer that doesn t have a retractable cord  its amazing and so much more organized than they use to be  maybe i m late on this new technology but its great  hair dryer itself is amazing as well and does the job in minutes  thie texture on this dryer feels nice  but it s much heavier than my last one  it hasn t gotten   34 sticky  34  as some have noted  but i ve only used it for a few weeks  it comes with a tiny diffuser  which was good  because my diffuser doesn t fit it  i wish i could get a larger one  but i ll have to look at an after market one   i ll probably have to take the dryer with me to make sure it will stay on  the dryer is pretty quiet and powerful  which is nice  br    br   one of the things i would change is the location of the buttons  i never fail to change the speed or heat when i m using it  i use a stronger grip on it due to the weight  so it s easier for me to hit a button on accident  br    br   i wouldn t   34 not  34  recommend it  but i would suggest to keep looking a little bit more  all hair dryers should have just the   34 cool  34  air function   i like it  others like it the cool air is powerful and i think it does not make my hair fall off  get it  i love this hair dryer  i have thick long hair and it take around 5 mins to dry my hair   love it so far so good  i ve had it about 2 months  cord still retracts and dries my thick hair fast with minimal frizz  great product  great airflow  i bought one a few years back  still working  br   a little big for travel  however i bought another for the guest bath  br   everything i ve ever wanted in a hair blower  br   delivery was prompt  reasonably priced  light  works well  you can turn off the heat so that it s just blowing room temperature air which is safer for your hair   got it for the gf who loves it   amazon s price is much better than anything i could find locally  i use this as my home hairdryer  not just when i m traveling although the bag it comes with makes it perfect for that too  it doesn t have a lot of power but my hair is really fine so a lot of hairdryers seem a little bit of overkill for me  i wouldn t recommend it for someone with really thick hair though as it might take a lot longer to dry  this works fabulous  dries my hair in 1 2 the time and works great for getting hair straight before using my hsi professional hair straightener  followed with hsi argan oil  worth every penny    pros  br    br   good amount of drying power considering how small it is br   perfect size for travel br   dual voltage works great  no explosions when i brought this dryer to europe  br    br   cons  br    br   plastic piece that changes the voltage has fallen out twice      br   when using in europe  the wind is very powerful    but that s good for me because my thick hair dries faster  br    br   bottom line  i do like everything about the dryer except for that darn plastic piece that falls out  if that we re not an issue  this would get 5 stars  after about a year this hair dryer started making a buzzing sound   when i disassembled it  i could see that the blades were breaking allowing the blades to rub against the housing causing the buzzing sound   had i not seen this  the blades would have eventually broken off and fired out at the user   there has been no recall so all the products are suspect   do not buy this product  this hair dryer is easy to use and has lots of power  the rubberized texture is easy to grip and hold  best  10 bucks spent  put in on my mirror  salon looking blowouts in minutes   why didn t i get this sooner  my husband uses the hairdryer a lot more than i do  he does not care for the way it works and the lack of settings  he is considering replacing it or removing it altogether  of all of the dryers i ve owned in my life  this is my favorite   i ve only been using it for 3 days and i m in love  this dryer is very light weight  two heat and air settings  dries hair quickly and quietly  very glad i was able to locate it after using it in a hotel i recently stayed in  nice quality feel  smooth operating switches  not too garish a color like those bright red conairs  unique  nice  happy with purchase  this does dry my hair   it is very light and compact but it does not have a lot of power even for my short hair  i discovered this hair dryer at an upscale hotel in  boston and took a photo of it with my phone to remember to research it  i am pleased with my purchase  it is lightweight and travels well  works just fine  and has a heavier  quality   34 feel  34  than the cheaper ones  mounts easy  and looks fine on the wall    34 you get what you pay for  34   don t get cheep like me  this hair dryer  is loud  even though it is identical tech specs to its big sister the infinity cord keeper   it s the bigger that s better  the larger version acts like a muffler  spend the extra  20 bucks  i did  the real deal is now on order  this is the second time i ve purchased this hair dryer as i loved the first one so much   it gets hot enough to straighten as it dries   would recommend highly  i received my leopard babyliss dryer from beauty and  and i believe it is the real thing   not a counterfit  the packaging  accessories  and dryer all appear to be very well made with great attention to detail  the cord is quite thick and long  you can tell by the cord alone that it is a powerful machine  it is the best hairdryer i have ever owned and it dried my very long fine blonde hair in under 5 minutes  without much heat at all  seems like it would cause less damage to hair   it is certainly worth the  59 95 i paid for it  i joked that at  10  this hair dryer will be lucky to last one year  it lasted a month  by the time i checked to return it  i had missed the deadline to do so   by one day  yup  this baby died quickly  sometimes  you indeed get what you pay for  compact for travel and very powerful can t beat it for the price  recommend it for anyone looking for a travel hairdryer or enen great for home use  i love this blow dryer  it s the most user friendly dryer i have ever used  it is well made   dries hair very nicely  without burning it  i love the retractable cord  the blow dryer folds shut so it s easier to store   cant believe i found such a great affordable blow dryer  curly hair here  i think it does dry faster  but my old machine was pretty worn out  br    br   i love that there is an actual setting for cool air plus the button for a shot of it  br    br   my finger always ached after using my last one  which only had that blue button and not the addt l setting  whom ever designed this hair dryer had to be stoned  they put the power switch buy your pinky finger so your constantly turning the dryer off every time you grip the handle  the   34 high  34  heat is ok  could be better  but as the old saying goes     34 you get what you pay for    34  so true  i like and it was very affordable i used it today for the first time and i was pleased i was skeptical about it but it saved me money    wonderful product  very well constructed and aesthetically pleasing  i would recommend this product to anyone who appreciates top quality at a reasonable price  wnc would recommend this for anyone  works great  runs fine and is perfect for what i needed it for  don t hesitate to buy this nice piece i like this product  i really like being able to change the heat settings  my only complaint is that the controls are in the same place as my hand so i sometimes inadvertently change the settings  this blow dryer straightened my course afro hair from root to tip  it is not difficult to hold or maneuver   the comb rubber comb is practically unbreakable   and great for tender scalps as well as the cool shot button  i chose this one because my hairdresser recommended it  she has a wide range of hair dryers but this blow dryer straightened my course afro hair from root to tip  it is not difficult to hold or maneuver   the comb rubber comb is practically unbreakable   and great for tender scalps as well as the cool shot button  i chose this one because my hairdresser recommended it  she has a wide range of hair dryers but is most satisfied with this one    and it doesnt break the bank   they need to make one with titanium technology   she is most satisfied with this one    and it doesnt break the bank   they need to make one with titanium technology    i d read some reviews stating this dryer had issues   but  i bought it anyway   i have no problems with the hose falling out or it not getting hot enough   works great   my only problem is that i had jumbo rollers in and the bonnet s opening was not large enough to easily get my head in without loosening the rollers in the process   next time  i ll just use smaller ones  i have very thin fine hair and only use a hair dryer for spot drying on occasion  i had a great little travel dryer that worked great for years until it recently just died on me  in looking for a new dryer i found most were too big and bulky for me  as well as too powerful for my hair  this dryer had the lowest wattage i could find  while it s still a bit too powerful for me  it serves my purpose  as it is small and lightweight  the only improvement i would have made would have been to have a foldable handle  i got this hair dryer b c i wanted a no frills  sturdy hairdryer  and that s exactly what i got  it performs exceptionally well and i have even dried   wait for it   chickens w  it outside  it s that sturdy     b c i m a woman i m not using the little blue button  regardless  this is an awesome piece of equipment  first  it s red and not blue  second  it s large  very heavy and loud  third  after 3 months  use  it died on me  vendor offers no return replacement after 30 days  i ve only used this a few times so far  but i really love it   i ve had difficulty finding a dryer that 1  doesn t fry curly hair  2  isn t too heavy when drying the back of my head  3  doesn t sound like a jet taking off  4 has a diffuser  and 4  has separate heat and power settings   with the warm actually warm  not hot  br    br   this dryer does all that   i m a very happy camper  i am a flight attendant and many hotels i stay in have this hair dryer and i love it  i had to order one for home   i have sister locs  i used the dyer to rod my hair and it worked great  it is exactly what i was looking for  had a similar one before and missed it when it finally died  i probably had it ten years or more  i really needed a good blow dryer to dry   straighten my hair and this one made my hair look really healthy  i love it  this died about a year after i got it  i wish it lasted longer  it was good while it lasted  let me first explain two things  br   one being that i work the nightly re stock shift at sephora and have my pick of any high end professional hair dryer at 30 50  off sale costs and i still chose this for many reasons  secondly  i have used the same revlon ionic  15 20 blowdryer since i was about 16years old and never had any problems with it  i always repurchased the same one maybe once every 6years or so  br    my hair is naturally curly but its slowly lost most of its curl through the years and been left with a good amount of volume and wave  my hair had always gotten pretty frizzy when i blew it dry but i just figured that was part of the drying process  one day while at work i was looking at a t3 and discussing how my hair frizzes  i was told that with the new hair dryers and such that this isnt what should be happening and that i should get a new high end hair dryer  i researched many of the new t3 and the drybar products only to be pretty disappointed considering the price  i actually bought a t3 and had problems with the end staying on it and the location of the switch and my hand  i had found the elchim but was skeptical of it bc of the name in general  i wasnt a big name brand and no one i talk to had ever heard of it  after one use i could tell a huge difference  it doesnt dry my hair any faster though  i dont have any frizz and it is smoother  smells better  not to hot to touch  and a lot more shine  i really do recommend this to any woman  or man  who is considering buying a new expensive blowdryer and cant make up their mind   go with this one first  i am a professional stylist and this blow dryer gets the job done    it is excellent for straightening natural african american hair  very affordable  reviews were accurate   it is quieter than my old one and quick   no need to spend a lot of money on a dryer when you have the quality with conair  i am a 27yr old black woman and i use this dryer to dry my 20in malaysian body wave full sew in  it dried my braids completely so if you re wondering if it works for weave yes  i ve only used it once since i bought it and once again to quickly dry my boyfriends boxers last minute and it worked for that too lol so im pretty satisfied  so far so good  thanks  i had an older model of this same hair dryer for several years  5 7   and it was great  recently  it started making some funny sounds while in use  so i decided it was about time to upgrade  for the price  there s really no better option than this one   it s relatively lightweight  easy to maneuver  and makes quick work of drying my long  thick hair  i ve never had an expensive  fancy hair dryer  so i can t speak to whether this is better or not  but i d say you can t beat the price for the quality  it works fine and it is really small  on the other hand  the cable and the plug are incredibly big for this kind of stuff     i love it   i have a bunch of hair and it dries it in no time while other dryers take more than 20 minutes to have way dry it  i am not very good at styling my hair but i find this dryer seems to be the correct temperature and has the directional stream going in the right direction   very easy to use   i had used the dryer at my daughters and so decided to purchase it   i would highly recommend it i bought this to blow dry my baby s hair  it is the perfect size for her when she gets older to dry her own hair  it is strong enough to dry hair quickly  but not to the point of burning hair scalp  i think it s a good product  it leaves your hair soft and it dries it easily  it fullfiled my expectations  this dryer has great power and really does help keep your hair from frizzing  br   it s great  and it has lots of power  or little  depending on the setting  i think this is great for travel and at home   you just sit and get your hair dryed and device is small enough to walk around with  i like the compact size and light weight of of this dryer  and my hair is noticeably smoother  br   my only disappointment is that i thought there were more heat settings   the product description says 3 heat air speeds  it is actually only 3 air speeds   a cool shot button  great hair dryer for traveling  or for the gym  or for someone who doesn t have a large space for storage i looked at blow dryers online for months before making this purchase  some costing hundreds of dollars   on my wish list was a dryer with a salon quality motor for durability  variable heat and speed settings  ceramic  and ionic   this dryer checks all the boxes   the reason i give it four stars rather than five is because there is no ionic on off switch  ionic on for smoothness  off for greater volume    i was surprised and pleased to learn that this dryer carries a four year warranty   many of the high priced dryers had only a one or two year warranty  no clue about the bad reviews   this dryer gets my hair good and dry  and it dries really fast too  its a keeper  i have had this hair dryer for several months now and am very satisfied   i purchased this model as my daughter has used the same  former model  for years   i highly recommend this purchase    this hairdryer is superb  like that i can dry my hair quickly as it is quite powerful  also like the folding handle  it is made for a woman s hand  easy to hold and handle  i chose this dryer based on the great ratings it got  i am highly pleased with it  works well  has all the temp  settings needed  i was looking at much more expensive dryers  and i really don t think one of them would have been better  highly  recommend  today   3 14 14  that i used my hair dyer  i have to say i just love it  my hair is naturally curly but takes so  long too dry  i have a hand held dyer with the diffueser attchatment an it makes my hair puffy   i started to look for this type of hair dyer that was quick an sufficient an when looking they were really expensive as well as shipping and handling but when i compared on amazon your company caught my eye because on the head of the dyer was elongated and there was zero shipping so  all i paid was 104 00 and other companies wanted more money and  shipping and handling  i also colored my hair an i use a heating cap an it does not color my head completely so  this will make for a better job on my color  thank you so so so so so much       works perfect for us  not too big and not too small  wife luvs the ease of it on the wall excellent my wife love it  this is one  of the best hair dryer would live to recommend because is silence and efficient  this thing works at spewing hot  warm and cool air   it s not terribly big or terribly loud   i have not used the accessories  but it s built pretty good and it has a nice hook on it for hanging it up   no complaints so far  get you one  this hair dryer was to replace my wife s previous conair travel hair dryer  this one is a little noisier than her old one  but is by no means a problem noise wise  it still is much quieter than many she has used in the past   br    br   the dryer drys her hair well and quickly  plus it was a great price on amazon  seems to be a good hair dryer  easy to use  not too heavy  i ve had it about a month  no complaints so far  cord is long enough  and it is a pretty teal  i purchased this dryer for traveling after reading some of the reviews   i thought the retractable cord would allow more room in my carry on bag too   i did not use the dryer so i can t review how well it works   the size even with the cord retracted was my problem  it was as large as my  home  hair dryer   that is why i returned it  use this for my dog   it has a mild setting that is just right for him after his bath   he hates baths  he would not give any thing associated with it 5  loved this blow dryer    but one night it got too hot too fast and went out  i thought it had died  but it was just hot and had to cool down overnight  i was only half dry  prefer this dryer for many years as it isn t too small to handle but large enough to hold and direct in drying hair  for medium size it is lightweight  i don t use the attachments for my shorter hair  dryer lasts for many years  i have used this dryer for years and i love it  being a hairstylist    we are rough on dryers and this one takes it to the bank  a great dryer   always handy  but not in the way   this is our second one and the first one lasted a long time  i won t lie  the color of this blow dryer caught my attention before anything  the reviews seemed decent and the price was great so i thought if go for it  br    br   i m glad i did  the blow dryer works really well  it dried my long hair really quickly  and my hair holds on to water forever  br    br   the only thing that dropped a star were the locations of the switches  these aren t normal buttons you can avoid  the entire front of the handle is made of two switches that you slide up or down to control heat and air power  i haven t accidentally changed the setting on myself  but its just an always spot and not easy to avoid  i have short hair  so use this as my daily hair dryer  very compact  strong heat and airflow   warning  it s a bit loud  few problems with this dryer  br   first  i ve had this dryer before  it was great  but after using it in the salon for a couple years it stopped working  as they do  br   second  the first time i plugged this dryer in the low blast setting did not work  as in  no air came out   i contacted the seller and i ve received no response  the dryer is not working  and i just want a different one  br   third  this seller is a complete scam  they send a piece of paper with the dryer that says they ll give you a two year warrantee if you leave a 5 star review  complete extortion  i can t believe amazon works with these guys  mind you  since they are not an authorized retailer it is very likely the manufacturer s warrantee is void  this creates a problem  br    br   bottom line  buy this from a different seller  love love love this hair dryer   this is my 3rd one over the course of many years   i not only use in my home but in my rv   great power and the size is just right    hangs on wall and that is a plus because it s at you fingertips when needed   this one just purchased replace one i have had for 10 years        they last a good long while  highly recommend  i love this new blowdryer  it s just as it described and was a very good price  i got it on time  too   works pretty well  but i ve been using it just over a year and now every time i turn it on  it trips my surge protector just a couple minutes in  it makes drying my thick head of hair a rather extensive process with having to turn it off  let it cool down  and then reset the surge protector  which otherwise works fine  i unplug everything else from it when using the dryer  which i didn t have to do before  but now if i don t  the dryer shuts off even more frequently  i just purchased another dryer from another brand as result  this is a fantastic littler hair dryer   despite the small size  it still gets quite warm and blows a good stream of air on high   while my hair is fairly short so perhaps this isn t saying much  it does dry it off quite quickly   the small size is also a plus as it makes it perfect for traveling   if you re looking for a hair dryer with attachments  you ll need to look elsewhere   but if you want a good  compact hair dryer  look no further  bought it because i ve always liked the ones in the hotel rooms   has good power and lightweight   helps to organize my bathroom  both my daughter and myself were looking for a dryer that didn t go in the drawer   i read all the reviews and choose this one  br    br   i really like the simplicity of the dryer   it dries my hair with ease and i have thick and long hair  br    br   the only drawback to this dryer is the length of the cord   make sure you can place close to the edge of your counter top  i broke my wife s babyliss tt 3000 dryer  guess they don t bounce   so i had to buy her a replacement   she has fine hair that lacks body   as i researched dryers i read that people with fine hair will get better volume   body if they don t use negative ion dryers but instead use neutral ion dryers   the price on the mk ii was about  30 more than the tt3000  which she liked  but i thought that with all the 5 star comments  i e  lighter weight  quieter  4 yr warranty  etc   it was worth it  especially since it had a negative neutral ion switch   when it came i mentioned all of its advantages to her   i was crushed when her first comments were  br   1  yes  its quieter than the tt3000 but that s because on high fan the air volume was equal to the low fan speed of the tt3000  br   2  no  the neutral ion setting didn t give her any more body volume than the tt3000 did  br    br   it is 2 5 ounces lighter than the tt3000  according to our digital postage scale  and she s ok with it s performance so i m not sending it back but i wished i d just gotten another tt3000 and saved the  30   maybe a  180 unit with neutral ion s would give her more volume but i do know that if this one breaks i m not buying another mk ii   sure wished someone would have posted a comment like this one so i didn t waste my money   personally  i like the build quality of the tt3000 also  what a great item   so much easier to have this regular item on my wall in the bathroom just like hotels   works great and has the ideal settings for my needs  my previous conair blow dryer had a retractable cord and i loved it   it was great for easy storage and my storage space is limited and cramped   after years though  that blow dryer died and i needed to replace it   i always go with conair because they make a trusty  yet inexpensive  product   i chose this one because of the retractable cord  the folding handle  and the dual voltage   i figured that if the retracting cord helped with storage  the folding handle has to be even better  right   plus  i m traveling internationally this year  so i thought the folding handle would be good for a suitcase and the dual voltage would be good for international power conversion   while i had high hopes for his blow dryer  it has really been nothing but disappointing    br    br   the blow dryer itself works great  like any other conair i ve owned   the retracting cord  the folding handle  and the dual voltage switch  however  do not   the joint on the folding handle is quite flimsy   the top of the blow dryer wobbles a bit back and forth and i m sure this will only get worse over time   this feature doesn t seem built to last   the retractable cord also doesn t retract   it gets stuck halfway through and still leaves about a foot and a half of cord sticking out of the end of the blow dryer   it s not a huge deal since the blow dryer still works  but it is definitely irritating since i bought the blow dryer specifically for this feature   i don t know for sure  but in my opinion  i think the retractable cord doesn t work right because of the folding handle   it just seems like that whole area is made flimsy and i think the cord is getting stuck inside the blow dryer near the joint of the handle   and finally  the dual voltage switch  i can t  for the life of me  get that thing to switch over   i ve tried using my acrylic nails  a screwdriver  my boyfriend  etc  and nothing has worked   unless you re traveling with thor  i wouldn t count on this feature   luckily i have a power converter for other electric items  so i can use that with the blow dryer   if it makes it that long   i may chuck the thing out a window next week  br    br   if anybody is interested in the conair blow dryer i had prior to this one  it was the conair you cord reel 2 in 1 hair dryer   it last me years and the retractable cord worked great  perfect size  for home or travel   it s not too small or too bulky or large   it puts out the perfect amount of heat and air  we used to buy the more expensive name brand hair products   after reading reviews of this dryer  we decided to try it   there are three girls in my family and we all use and love this dryer  this is just the right size and weight  i have a lot of trouble with my wrist and this dryer handles so nice  also it does not take up much space at all  the only reason i have this four stars is because the only problem i have with it is that it isn t as powerful as my last dryer  which was different  but for the money i spent i got every penny  it works just fine and i love how you don t have to press an additional button to go to the cool setting like old dryer  i needed a blow dryer for college this was cheapest one i found and it has a cool setting works perfect for me this dries my hair so much faster than my old hair dryer  it gets hot enough but not to hot and i love that you can change the temp settings on it  the cool blast button also works very good  the cord is long enough and it is not to loud  doesn t seem to dry my hair out and make it frizzy at all either  would definitely buy again  very pleased  works great  it does exactly what it says   it came with all the attachments in the pic  i love it  i bought this dryer specifically because the handle could collapse and the cord was retractable  which i thought would make it fit in my drawer   both features work well but  it still wouldn t fit in the drawer   this dryer does not get very hot so it takes longer to dry my hair than my previous one   however  it was a good price and you get what you pay for   i ll keep it but i would try another model before i bought this again  i used this brand of hairdryer for the first time during a recent hotel stay  and i just loved it   it s light  fast  and easy to use   the buttons are also conveniently placed so that my hand is not on them as i use the dryer   i liked the dryer in the hotel so much that i immediately ordered one   it s a super dryer  just about the best i ve ever used  this dryer just feels like a quality build  after a week of use  i will say that it performs way beyond what i expected  while i have relatively short hair and this dryer gets the job done in about one fourth of the time my old dryer did  i wouldn t have believed it if i hadn t experienced it    34    more than you can afford pal   34  is not a phrase you should apply here  it s quieter  blows harder  has ionizer or maybe a deionizer  it s red  has an awesome cord  br    br   and did i mention its very quiet  has more of a whooooooooosh shound than typical shrill hair dryer    34 wheeeeeeee zzzzzzzzzzzz eeeeee zzzzzz eeee hrrrrrrrrrrrrrr ddrrrrrrrrrrrrr wheeeeeeeeesh  34  super awesome   dries my hair in no time   makes it shine and the style lasts for several days  very good  i bought this dryer to make it easier to do both my daughters hair and to teach them how to dry their hair on the type of dryer i learned on   wonderful purchase the price was great and this dryer dries hair so much faster than my old model   would buy again just what my wife wanted for the bath room  just the right size to fit on the small apace next to the mirror  was easy tp install and looks like a professional job of installation  this is an awesome blow drier   i m going to buy it and give it to my girlfriends for gifts  you really can t beat the price for the quality you get   i first tried it in an upscale day spa in chicago   i had to call the place to find out the brand and model because that was the best hair day of my life to date   now my hair is shiny and frizz free every day   i couldn t be happier  this dryer never fails me  it does a great job every time  it gets super hot  which can be dangerous  i love this hair dryer   long cord and great power drying  drys fast and styles with attachments that came with it  hair looks great after  i love the retractable cord feature  except when the retract button sticks in place only a few weeks after purchase   i guess i will do it the old fashioned way and wrap the cord    i like it  it s working very well  like the heat a lot  get things done faster  it s strong too  definitely a good deal  surprisingly light and effective for drying my hair  it came with extra attachments in a cute zebra striped bag  i wouldn t use it on the highest setting or for long periods of time  it is super small and easy to take around  this hair dryer was perfect for my needs  and the pricing didn t hurt anything either  i am more than satisfied  2 thumbs up all around  the bonnet hair dryer is fabulous     it s so lightweight   i can dry my curls and read a book in ease  absolutely love it  i love the automatic on off feature when you use the dryer   powerful enough for my short hair   would purchase again  i needed a good hair dryer bad   i ordered this not really knowing it had a retractable cord   what an awesome idea   just love it  i love this item     not only is pink my favorite color but one of my close friends is fighting cancer  so it serves 2 purposes but it also work great     thank u     i appreciate it s light weight  however the   34 high  34  speed is much too powerful and quite loud   i ve put it aside as a travel or emergency hair dryer  this is the second one i ve purchased  still using the first one which i purchased at bed bath   beyond    i like its features so much that i bought this second one as a back up in case the first one quits  but it s still going strong at about five years old  i received the hair dryer today   i used it on my daughters hair and it worked just as promised   i am african american and this is the first hair dryer that i have purchased that has actually lived up to its claims   my daughter has thick hair and this dryer literally cut the drying time in half   the handle is comfortable to hold and the attachments work perfectly   also this hair dryer is much quieter than older models similar to this one   i would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone who hates long drying times   it gets the job done and it gives your hair a natural shine  i was really expecting a great little hair dryer  but it was not  br   it is super loud and overly hot and makes a bit of a grinding noise  br   just really did not like it at all  so i sent it back  br   still looking for a quiet  powerful  but not too hot dryer  i ve had my dryer for 3 years   i love it   i m african american and i decided to go natural   because i have very coarse  kinky hair  it proved to be a great dryer for straightening my hair   one downfall   my comb broke and trying to replace it with a universal comb has been a nightmare   i called conair and don t replace the comb  but they will replace the dryer   the rep said to send it back to them and they will send me another dryer in 3 weeks   i couldn t afford to wait that long so i decided to buy another dryer  so now i have two and i love both of them  i had my reservations before i bought this  but i am so glad i did  it is small enough to travel with and has loads of power to dry even the thickest head of hair  great purchase   my conair hair dryer decided to bite the dust on me and the following day i was having a medical procedure done   i was pressed for time so i ordered this one and have one day shipping   i must say that i love this hairdryer   it is pretty in color and looks exactly like it does online   it is not too heavy and comes with two extensions   i love the choices between low  medium and high and also low  warm  hot and cool   i highly recommend this item   it is not too noisy either  dave s wife  br    br   i was sick of my old 1875w hairdryer s cords always getting in the way in the cabinet so i ditched it for a folding model with a retractable cord  br    br   people said this dryer was loud  but i didn t find that to be true  br    br   it works very well and i m happy with it  just be aware that the cord doesn t retract all the way  it only retracts to a certain point  br    br   still  much better than what i had and it works great  haven t used it yet  the packaging is great and compare to the price i have seen for the same make and model it is good  this hairdryer has a good weight to it and the motor sounds quiet and smooth  drys my hair quickly  love the retractable cord  i have used this dryer for many years and decided to purchase another one for travel   lightweight and a good airflow  i really like this dryer and am enjoying using it   my other one had bit the dust after about 7 years  i love this hair dryer   it is very quiet compared to many dryers i have had   it is awesome having so many heat and speed settings   it comes with attachments which is a plus but doesn t really need them  the retractible cord is very handy for storing in the drawer   i would definitely buy again  the only con i can find is that it is a little heavier them i am use it  i researched various black on wall hairdryers and i liked that this one was compact and a cord that seemed like it would stay out of the way  i mostly purchased this for when the girls are at the house and need a hairdryer  but it s actually come in handy for me as well  anyway  mount and forget this thing  the cord for how i mounted it does slop around on the counter top a bit  but you really need that to have a comfortable amount of distance to use it  br    br   anyway  i m very into more modern looking gadgets and the compactness of this and sleek black made it a great fit  after two years  it s still working great and gets a decent amount of use  no problems whatsoever  i use this every day and it is a good reliable product but the power switch has started to stick   i think that a shot of wd 40 would fix it  though   i have been using it for many years and like the product   i would buy another and recommend it highly to others  i not always that i would find a blow dryer for this price and it gets as hot as this one  it does wonders with my daughters very natural hair  i love it and would recommend it to everyone  this hair dryer is as good as all the reviews say it is  it does give off a gross plastic smell when you use it though  if you can get past that then you ll love it  excellent hair dryer for a low price   i have 2 of these dryers   they easily fit into a gym bag  get the job done and is very simple to operate   you can t go wrong with this dryer i put this dryer on my wishlist and it was purchased for me by my husband  it gets very hot  just like the ones in the salons  the temp  is adjustable and the motor runs without creating a lot of excess noise  i like that the hood is extra large and adjustable great color combination too  the instructions on how to put the unit together could be a bit more clear  but are not totally confusing and shouldn t keep anyone from purchasing the drying  the first one lasted me ten years and passed down to my son still working  i really love the retractable cord  prevents clutter  it s amazing you don t know how bad your old hair dryer was until you purchase a new one  this hairdryer has so much power but is also quieter than others   my old hair dryer took 20 min to blow dry my thin  fine hair  this one only took 5 min  love the neon green color and love how the handle folds for travel   works great  my new conair 1875 watt pro style hair dryer works just fine  but my previous one  same brand and same wattage  was much lighter to hold  i m getting used to it but was hoping when i ordered it that it would be exactly like the one i had  since it lasted for years  this really could be almost the perfect hairdryer if for only 2 things   it doesn t get hot enough and it s missing a cold shot button   the air flow is perfect  i love the different speeds and heat settings  how it feels  the lenth of the cord  etc    it just doesn t get hot enough to straighten smooth the hair like my chi did  even at its hottest setting   i need to flat iron afterwards  my hair has a medium natural wave    i love the way the elchim is made  so i m going to try different models to see if they have what i m looking for  it worked fine on my trip to israel   it is easy to pack for travel and has a lot of power  i have had many blow dryers          then of course i needed another one  so br   instead of going to target again  i thought let me see whats out there     i love amazon so br   that was the first place i went to  i saw this blow dryer and read the reviews and thought  let me give this br   a  try  because of the revew  and i just love  love this blow dryer  great hair dryer    super quiet  and dries hair quickly     it is very light compared to my other hairdryers and the cord winder works very well i ordered this hair dryer for my wife   shipping was right on the money and packaged superbly with no damage  br   my wife loves it   if she loves it then i plumb tickled  this was a gift to my mrs  br   decent dryer  br   all the features of her expiring one  br   very good price  br   arrived on time for christmas  br   excellent packing and shipping  br   runs every day without a blip  this hair dryer is awesome  dries my hair in 10 min  and leaves it smooth  other dryers i ve tried either overheat before i m done drying  or take at least double the time  br    br   i actually had to order one for my mother after she tried mine  dries my hair fast and love the cool shot button  what i don t like is that it has a big square plug  cord does not completely retract as i originally thought  it still hangs out of the dryer by about a foot  but it still works great  i used the blow dryer for the first time tonight and i love love love it  for one it is pretty and it has different temperatures you can choose from  and different air speeds  my hair is really frizzy  and the blow dryer helped to de frizz my hair  love it   i take this hair dryer to the gym with me in my gym bag   it fits perfectly  and has my short hair dry in no time   it also gives my hair some volume  i use the diffuser    it s sturdy  and i m very pleased with it  it is unique and portable  i love the style  the brand and by using it my hair dries quickly  i would recommend it to everyone who needs a blow dryer  thank you this is a good ceramic hair dryer for the money   the retractable cord is a bonus   don t expect a  20 dryer to last forever so treat it gently and it will last a long time  our daughter has very long hair and sometimes needs to be dried  she likes having her own hair dryer  and this model is not expensive  it gets the job done  it helps that she likes anything with hello kitty on it  i really liked this dryer so much that i bought a second one   the problem with both dryers is that after about 18 months of use both have started shotting sparks out once they get heated up   if you have your receipt you can ship back for a refund   seems it is a known issue and they should stop selling or fix the issue  exactly what i was looking for     as it is only used when traveling and hair is short   light weight and folds neatly  it gets my long hair dry in record time without drying it out    i love the cool down button as well  the dryer is lightweight and very easy to travel with   this was my favorite until it blew with normal use   suddenly smoke came out   i turned it off  vacuumed the lint that wasn t very bad   flipped the red safety switch   nothing worked   i m really bummed  i bought this to replace an older model of the same  not as good as my older one but a great little dryer nonetheless  2 out of the 3 attachments don t fit the dryer  very cheap end of what i know andis is capable of   you won t be happy with this if you re looking for a professional grade dryer  wall mounted hair dryer is a space saver in the small bathroom  and for a condo that is also a vacation rental  this works very well  we won t know how well it holds up over time until we get   34 over time  34   but for now    looks good  sounds good  dries well  dry hair extremely quick and leave hair in a perfect condition  br   it needs less about half time than other hair dryer  br   and the hair is smooth without any damage  br   it is an impressive product  br    br   cons is the weight  it is heavier than other brands  br   however i don t have to hold it for too long since it dries hair super quick  hence the weight is not too big an issue to me  bought this hairdryer for my overseas travel needs  and considering that the features of being foldable and having a retractable cord would be suitable for travelling  i purchased this item  there was no information about the voltage on product description  but it was available for shipping internationally so i deduced that it is dual voltage   amazon shipped this item to singapore  220volts   once i tried it on  it fried my adaptor plug  and the hairdyer stopped working too after 2 seconds  such a dissapointment  mine was getting quite old and cranky and i decided time for a new one  this has hot and cold setting  great power and is not terribly noisy  great quality  easy to use  heats up fast with lots of power  it s well worth the money invested when you need to replace your outdated blow dryer  it worked well for me  since i use it everyday  no complaints on this product   easy to use and handle works well so far  i thought i d give it a try since it was a fairly low price  it was bigger than i thought it would be  so if you re looking for something to travel with  this might be a bit too big  other than that  this is a really good deal love this hair dryer and it provides excellent results very quiet while drying and i can finally watch tv thank you you plug it in and it blows warm  almost hot  air   both buttons are perfectly placed to maximize accidentally turning off the dryer in the middle of a blowout   the cord becomes so twisted and tangled that you won t be able to get a foot from the outlet  hey  you ll never have to worry about dropping it in the tub    this works well and easy for me to hold over my head when drying my hair   the night light is almost too bright and there is no off on switch for it  so i unplug the unit when i don t want the light in   if i needed a dryer for the gym or rv  i would choose a model with the dryer and holder as separate units so i could pack only the dryer alone   as the unit is installed in my bathroom  it works well for me but not easy to take anywhere else  bought two of these  one for each bathroom   i like the controls on the handle and the ability to adjust the temperature and the power while you re using it   my husband  however  doesn t particularly like that feature    i guess with larger hands he finds himself inadvertently changing the settings while he s gripping the dryer   i also like three temperature settings  high  medium  and cool   too many dryers i ve used before just have high or no heat   i really like it  husband is just ok with it  good  hair dryer  i have to get used to the rectangle shape of it  rather than being round  it s a little bigger than i would like but works great and has 3 heat settings  and 3 comb attachment   didn t care for the comb too much  another successful product  product showed up on time and close to previous conair product i used  met all expectations and was very happy  it costs too much electricity     br   i have to turn off all the lights when i use this product     br   it is quite too mass i had always wanted a ceramic blow dryer   leaves my hair smoother and less flyaways   great product for the money  let s face it  i m a guy   i use a hair dryer about 3 minutes every morning when i get out of the shower   i don t need tourmaline gemstone coated heating elements  i don t need salon duty roller bearings  i don t need a pink gemstone encrusted handle  br    br   i need something that blows hot air out the front when you press the switch  and this model does it   works fine  without all the bells  whistles  and gee gaws  and without breaking the bank   oh and it s blue   a good guy color  great heat and strength controls   great handling to style hair   i have had numerous conair hair dryers over my lifetime and will continue to purchase them due to ther great quality  dryer is light weight but powerful  a lot of hair dryer for the price  i m 6 ft tall and it would be nice if the cord was just a little longer  this is the second one i have purchased and will continue to buy product as long as they make it   love that it hangs on the wall  the shape of it makes it easy to hold  thanks to this hairdryer  lots of air  variable temperature  light weight too  every feature i want and need  great price too  this is a quality hair dryer  no doubt about that  but in my search to replace an old and cheap one  i didn t consider the size and weight of these newer  salon quality ones  very impressed when i received it  but found it quite heavy and loud  due to a more powerful motor w  multiple features  the mid heat setting  which i was really looking forward to   having only  unbearably hot  on my prior dryer  was actually pretty cool and the warm setting not really that warm  maybe that s something to get used to  but didn t seem to dry my hair that fast  the other issue for me was simply that the dryer was so much larger that it wouldn t fit in my vanity drawer  and with no other storage option  had to find a model that fit  i like andis hair dryers a lot   this version has a retractable chord and a folding handle   great for my daughter s college dorm room with limited space   great for travel   i would give it 5 stars  but it has limited heated selection   wish it had a warm setting   instead of just the hot   other than that  it is a nice  powerful  convenient dryer  this thing really pack a punch  perhaps they have to make the outlet diameter larger than others so the wind pressure isn t too great on the head and hair  this thing isn t slim but not too big nor too heavy  my just turn teen daughter like it and find it not too big or heavy  br    br   from out many broken hair dryers ceramic is certainly heat more even than non ceramic ones  but since we mainly use it to dry rather than style  i m not sure fancy ceramic is really better than ceramic  there is only one rocker button for cool   turbo  the other buttons are large slide buttons so you can t accidentally change the settings  the finish is quality hard glossy plastic  i will not buy non slip rubbery finishes again as they degenerate in no time  br    br   so far so good for a couple of months  but i think they realized that they made a big mistake by not marketing it only to salons  with a price to match  i would love to have another one to replace my daughter s broken one but now it sells for 10 times the price i paid  great product  i would recommend for anyone  i had no issues with it  and it does it does fight the frizz  have been through so many blowdryers and i have to say this is the best blowdryer i have ever owned  inexpensive and does exactly what you need it to   my hair is about shoulder length and it dries it within about five minutes which is great  it can be loud on the higher setting but most hair dryers are  i recommend it  my old ionic dryer was dying  i liked that this one featured an   34 on demand  34  ion option  and other reviewers vouched for its quiet  i am using it now for a few months  and it is really a great dryer   it is light  balanced  and easy to handle   i like that you can switch the ion on off  and that heat air settings are completely adjustable   and it really  really is quiet  it does what is says it does  and it is worth the      also shipped quickly  makes you hair shiny and fires very quickly  this drier is perfect for what i need   i can now dry my hair in 10 minutes by just sitting there  instead of 40 minutes with a hand held drier   it has a temperature control and a timer  but it does not have a switch to control the wind speed  as was listed in the description   the speed control switch was even on the diagram that came packaged with it  but it was not on the drier   despite this  i am keeping the product and am very happy with the results i am getting   one thing to note is that there is some assembly required for the stand  and there were no instructions included   i managed to put it together just using the diagram  but if this is not your strong point  enlist help  i bought this for my family and we all just love it   the cord is a little on the shorter side  but the dryer itself works great and dries the hair very fast  worth the    love the hair dryer  easy to carry and take with me on the go  great so far  really like it a lot  use it at home as your   34 go to  34  hairdryer or bring it with you on trips   so light   easy with lots of power   love the color too  this blow dryer is super  i would really recommend it to anybody looking for a blow dryer   thank you  diane heuring this is a very nice dryer   i had one and when my daughter in law used it  she wanted one too   we are both very satisfied  got this for my wife    so i m not the end user  but from my observation  this hair dryer was much quieter than her old one  it also did the job much faster  the only reason i can t give it five stars was that the documentation was very sparse  there are a couple of features that would benefit greatly if it came with a manual to explain it  i ended up having to google to find out what they do  br    br   overall  a very good product  my wife would recommend it  its good but its heavy and it will tired you out really fast so be quick and efficient  also it gets kinda hot too so you wanna be double quick  or just stop  and wait a few if you re heat conscious like me  great product   dries hair much faster than previous less expensive dryers which stop working after a year   attachments weren t in box and merchant had excellent customer service   would buy again product from merchant again   very happy   healthier hair  this is a very nice dryer and actually the second one we have had   we wore out the first one after many years of daily use   my only complaint  and it is a small one  is the night light is too bright   it needs to be toned down a little   other that that this is a great hair dryer  love this dryer  pretty color and i am absolutely digging the retractable cord  works perfectly  i read that some folks were not happy with the length of the cord but i found it to be more than long enough for me  im not sure why you would need it any longer  very satisfied customer  this is my favorite hair dryer by far  i have thick hair and it takes a while for it to dry this blow dryer cuts that time in half  when i m done the finished look is amazing my hair is shiny and healthy looking i have received many compliments on how shiny my hair is  i defiantly recommend this  i am a product guru i v tried many different straightener blows  curling irons and of course blow dryers and i am very satisfied with the results i would definitely recommend i am african american and my hair is natural  this blow dryer gets my hair straight without the extra hassle plus the comb attachment makes it super easy  i buy cheap  i don t need anything fancy  just something that gets the job done  this works great  gets at right temperature comes with attachments  it s better than a  30 one my sister bought  this dryer has plenty of power and is not too loud  haven t used it alot yet but so far i really like it  i love my bed head         this hair dryer does what it says works great  gets hot  i did notice that it does make my hair shiny  great find at an awesome price  i ordered this dryer to replace a   34 vidal sassoon  34  branded hot comb dryer that had served me well for many years   i wanted it because i really like the   34 hot comb  34  style   after receiving it and noting the similarities with my old unit i would bet that andis manufactured the dryer for vidal sassoon   not only was the design almost identical  but the comb and brush attachments were identical and  in fact  would interchange perfectly with my old unit   if that is the case  this one should also last for many trouble free years   it does have one design feature that caused some initial confusion   the unit has three heat settings but there are only two fan speeds   the fan operates at the same speed on both medium and high heat settings which makes it appear that the switch is not doing anything   a check with my ammeter revealed  however  that the electrical load does increase a few amps and the air does get hotter in the high position   i am not saying that this is any kind of a problem  but i just thought it unusual since my old one had three fan speeds  br    br   i would personally question the part about the   34 ionic  34  feature   34 breaking up water molecules  34  to accelerate drying but the ad writers gotta have something to do  br    br   at any rate  it was just what i was looking for and does a great job  like all the twin turbo dryers  this one is built to last  the dryer feels solid and the materials are high quality  it s also much lighter than my 3200  and smaller   i m an editorial stylist and i m hard on my tools but my twin turbos always last for years  and they re repairable   a few things to mention  the nozzles on my dryer are very hard to get on and hard to rotate when in place  perhaps they just need to break in   also this dryer has a shorter   34 snout  34  much like the 3500  so if you re used to having a more traditional dryer like the 2700 or 3200 it will take a bit of getting used to  very nice dryer with great hot air output  the best as far as i m concerned  this hair dryer is light  but powerful   it dries my hair quickly but doesn t dry it out   i m very happy with it  i don t use a blow dryer often  but with a new short cut i found i needed to  this blow dryer does wonders in a short time with my curls     i use the diffuser attachment that came with it   super  love the weight and size   but mainly i have naturally curly hair so was very happy w the diffuser  i would highly recommend this dryer  it frees up space on my counter since it is a hang up  and yet has great blowing power  and the night light is a great plus  no need to have a separate night light to take up valuable outlet space  there is never enough outlets in a bathroom   even though this is a   34 professional  34  style pistol hair dryer it s not  full sized   it s medium sized   br   it s best suited for shorter hair styles  otherwise it may take longer hair longer to dry due to less air flow and it s 1600 wattage  but it s still pretty powerful for a medium dryer   br   it s light weigh and has a matte finish  this is the first hair dryer i have ever owned that did not leave my hair smelling like smoke   i am a black woman with natural hair  absolutely no chemicals nor weave  and my hair is more susceptible to dryness and breakage   therefore  it is extremely important for me to be extra sensitive and mindful to the type of products i use on my hair  this dryer did not pull my hair out  no burnt smell and i didn t mind the sound quality  afterall it is a hair dryer not a fan  the only negative i have is that the buttons can easily be depressed while blow drying your hair   so you may have to double check a few times as i did to make certain you are using the right temperature on your hair   here is a tip i learned  when planning on using hot curlers  flat irons etc  please cool your hair down first  the cool shot button truly does help and use a non buildup non oily heat treatment   the more natural and or organic the better  wait at least 10 minutes or longer before proceeding to styling  heat from the dryer with immediate usage of other heat sources can cause stress and unnecessary damage  or more damage  to your scalp and hair  also  when using the pik  if you come in contact with a tangle  please do not force the pik thru   you will tear your hair apart   use your fingers or a detangler comb to separate the tangle  then proceed in continuing drying  i probably do not need all this power  but there is a low setting so that makes it better   it fits my space very well it does everything a good dryer should do   the retractable cord doesn t work as well as it should unfortunately but can be managed  fast drying with lots of shine   i was first introduced to this hair dryer at a 5 star hotel i stayed at   it dries hair fast with lots of shine  good  handy  easy to use  small enough to put in suitcase when traveling  takes up very little space when storing   this was easy to assemble  it feels sturdy  everything works as it should  the only drawback is that all the air blows from the top  not the sides  so my hair dries unevenly  also  the hood is rather long and skinny  so there isn t much room to move or use curlers  if you ever wanted to  this just arrived and i ve used it only once but my first impression was good   it dried my hair  which has natural waves and can be difficult to dry style  quickly and seemed more powerful than my last one  it is really powerful  my wife love it  it dries real fast your hair and the price is excellent  recommended  had surgery on my hand so i needed something light weight  yet powerful enough to dry my very long thick hair  took a chance and was surprised that the dryer was both   excellent price as well  i am buying another one for my daughter in law  this hair dryer is everything that i could have expected  the diffuser is perfect for my curly hair  it dries quickly and efficiently  plus  i love the controls  i m 61  and my hair has become quite thin  this dryer really volumizes and gives my hair the perfect curl  a must buy  pretty good hair dryer my dad inlaw sometimes  uses it to dry his clothes if that means anything and it hasn t burnt out yet  it is exactly what i needed  it dries and smooths my long  wavy  curly hair  also very easy to handle  other than the retracting cord   which is cool   this is a pretty basic dryer  but i returned it because the retracting mechanism feels and sounds like it won t last long  and it just looks a little too cheap  i m happy with the replacement   the babylisspro tt for only a little more     looks nicer  feels nicer  works nicer  and is lighter  i have spent lots of money on expensive hair dryers  and this one is by far the best i ve ever used  this is my second one of these each of my daughters wanted one   my daughters and their mother say they get great results everytime  this was a gift to my daughter  loves the pink color  works great she has used the hair dryer everyday since she has received it  other reviews stated it was to hot   not for me  gets warm but i could not call it hot  br    br   recommend i am able to dry my hair faster  this dryer is simple  powerful and it s easy to handle  love it  i just got me new blow dryer and i love it  it is so quite and it dry s my hair in half the time of my old one  i also love that the cord winds right up  i think this blow dryer is stronger than my full size blow dryer   it is just the perfect size and the folding handle is great   i looked a long time for a good brand  reliable compact dryer with a folding handle   so glad i spotted this one on amazon   this dryer and a compact flat iron are the perfect pair  i purchased this hairdryer after the last one  which was just like this one died    i love that it is a wall mount and is out of the way and not a hairdryer laying on the counter   i also like that it is quieter than most hairdryers   it is not a   34 turbo  34  type dryer   i have shorter hair so it is works well but if i had really long hair i might would consider a stronger one   i also like the night light on it   it is not a really bright light  but just enough to shed light to walk into the bathroom without bumping into things and not have to turn a light on  great dryer with a lot of power   quick drying hair   i love it and would recommend to anyone   very satisfied  this is a great hair blower and i can t believe how good it is for the price   don t know why one would get a more expensive one  this thing is so fantastic  seriously  i m tempted to buy another and just stash it in the closet in case it discontinues before i need a new one  it dries my hair so quickly and leaves it smoother than i ve ever experienced from a dryer  i m notorious for showering at night simply so that i don t have to bother with drying my hair because it takes too much time in the mornings  but this dryer makes what is generally a lengthy and annoying process a quick  simple thing  the retractable cord is a huge plus  the folding neck is a plus  i really just can t say enough good things about this dryer  especially for the price  buy it  i purchased this dryer in august 2013  february 14th the heater element burnt out  very short life but great when it worked  wondering how to return or replace  this dryer is average size nothing compact about it   and it s not as warm as my normal one but it does fold up and i love the cord i usually turn it on high for a few seconds just so it will warm up a bit but the high is to strong to dry my bangs and hair so i turn it down to med  great power and portability  size is not too small or too large   i would recommend if you want a powerful travel dryer  i was very impressed with the color black and the  nightlight will come in handy at night time  it was easy to install  after going on vacation and this blow dryer being in my hotel room  i found out which model it was and immediately bought it online  it is the best hair blow dryer i have ever owned  i love it still going strong 2 years later  i am samoan  i have a lot of hair and it gets done in less than 10 minutes  thank you   works well  priced right  but the attachment bracket almost makes it is   34 permanent  34  attachment to your wall   try to remove it and something will break  this particular dryer is very powerful  yet lighter weight than others i ve owned   it s very easy to handle  has several settings available  and the accessories are easy to attach   my only criticism is that the concentrator is remains stationary which means i must turn the dryer to direct the flow of air  but it s not a big issue   am making a recommendation to the company to make the change  this is a super blow dry i ever see  br   its fast and strong save a lot of time to dry my client hair br   i wish they could made this blow dry a featherweight in the fulture br   thanks i have very curly  color treated hair that gets too curly and frizzy when dried with a diffuser  this dryer is perfect to dry my hair and do deep conditioning treatments  i usually let my hair air dry  which can take 2 hours  with the dryer  i put it on cool for about 25 30 minutes while i return emails  and i m good to go  i like the ability to roll it around as well as the temp and timer dials  shipping was very fast  i ve used it about 3 times per week for a couple of weeks  and so far so good  works really good   thought it was bigger though   it has a small nozzle  but it definitely gets the job done  very good  i use it everyday  and it has worked very well for 5 months  the price is attractive  the protective switch is convenient  yes  it was dirt cheap  but my wife reports it s not that great   apparently it doesn t get as hot as other models  and the air it pushes is just so so  so it takes longer to work  conair 124tl folding handle 1875 watt dryer great item  fast drying  great colors  i do have several other dryers that i end up giving away or trash them they are way to big and heavy  so this is just right this hairdryer isn t as powerful as i thought it would be  i have cheaper ones from target that blow more air  i got it for the cool air switch and it does work fine  just what we were looking for   compact light and functional  haven t used it yet but seems to be what i wanted   good quality of manufacture  just what the dr  ordered  this dryer has good air velocity  but the air isn t as warm as i would like it to be  also it has a higher pitch whine than i would have expected for a dryer of this size  i have a little portable dryer and this one sounds almost identical  i do love the retractable cord  it s nice not having a bunch of loose cord everywhere  i also like that it folds down to a smaller size for packing away  it s a powerful little dry and it comes with a lot of attachable heads if your the type to use it  br   it gets pretty hot on the hottest setting and in fact will turn off by itself if it overheats  turning itself back on later once it s cooled  br   dries well and is definitely better than my old lower watt conair  i defrost my freezer with it  i thawed out my car doors with itr   i live in a humid part of the country where a towel doesn t quite get the job done so i use it for that   i even dey my hair with it i would have given it 5 stars  but the toggle switches for speed and heat are located where you grip the handle  as you can see from the picture  and i m constantly turning the heat back up because i ve hit the switch while drying my hair   lots of cool attachments i haven t tried yet  i have curly hair and in order to dry it without frying it  i like to use a diffuser  a low fan setting and a mid heat setting   this hair dryer claims to have all of that  but the   34 warm  34  heat setting is so cool that i have to use   34 hot  34  if i ever want my hair to actually dry   the   34 hot  34  setting is what it claims to be and can be downright scalp scalding   i have no problem with the hot setting being that hot  i appreciate it when i m straightening my hair  but the   34 warm  34  setting is insufficient for my needs  br    br   other than that  the hair dryer is great  the attachments work well  the condenser doesn t spin like i ve had happen on other hair dryers  the retractable cord doesn t have any problems  the air intake never sucks my long hair in and the color is even a nice midway point between red and pink  love this full hair dryer that isn t compact while retracted  and  has the full power of a normal hair dryer  br   love the color br   i do wish it had a hot or hotter setting though like the infinity pro by conair 1875 watt hair dryer   purple  which i also have br   all in all a very good compact hair dryer that drys hair fast  i wanted to have something that helped keep counters clear   this is inexpensive and serves the purpose  cords don t stretch out and looks organized  it s is awesome  made my life easier and i don t have to go to the parlor every week as i was doing before  i have curly hair  with this product im able to blow dryer well and style with my flat iron  the only negative about it  is the little attachable brush  not good quality  i used once and its gone  needs a replacement  the combs are fine  br   overall i recommend the product  it was a great addition  br   rose rosa this hair dryer works great for me and the price is very reasonable  it also more than met my expectations  the dryer is light weight and full of options   i am quite pleased with it and will buy the same brand again   makes hair straight but oh my god  it plugs out every 5 seconds  i am perfectly satisfied with this blow dryer  although it is fairly small  it is quite powerful and dries my hair in no time  br   very happy with my purchase  i have been happily using this dryer for 8 years   best dryer i have ever purchased and no indication that it won t be going strong 8 years from now i ve using this dryer for 2 months and decided to get one for my sis and my mom too  it s different than the regular dryer cuz it comes w  multi functions  you can choose   34 scalp mode  34  for sensitive scalp and   34 skin mode  34  when applying face mask  its a bit pricey but the money is all worth it   i didn t realize it included the retractable cord  it works great  the folding handle is also a plus  also good power i was very happy with it for the first 5 months  but was shocked this morning when it made a loud bang and tripped the circuit breaker   i have never had a hair dryer break in this short amount of time   buyer beware   i can t return it  but i ll write remington and let them know what i think of their product  i bought this well over a year ago but wanted to write a review since i enjoy this hair dryer so much  what i love about it most is the retractable cord  awesome invention  i also like that you can remove and clean the filter  noise level is standard for a hair dryer  maybe even slightly quieter than average  my only criticism is that it is the heaviest hair dryer i have owned  so glad i bought this and not a super cheap one  bang for the buck  bought this for my wife  since she was struggling with a spaced out hair dryer that she s been using for many years  this worked perfectly  would recommend for anyone who doesn t like a change  although it long overdue  lives up to the expectations the dryer was  dare i say it  greasy  i thought as long as it works  fine  nope  does not work  the seller  hottest deals  should be ashamed of what they sent for the price i paid  i first bought this hair dryer because of the positive reviews left by other reviewers with thick hair  in the morning  i don t want to spend 20 minutes just making sure my hair is dry before i leave  i want some time to style  too  br    br   this hair dryer has a professional quality motor  1875 watt ac motor  which translates to stronger air flow  hotter air  and less drying time  that s exactly what i wanted and that s what i got  this hairdryer  with the airflow concentrator attachment  dried my hair in under 7 minutes  which is unheard of for me  it has 3 heat settings  2 fan speeds  and a cool air shot button  br    br   bonus  this hair dryer is quieter than a lot of others i ve owned  it s still a hair dryer  so it ll make noise  but this one s noises are hushed  br    br   besides its speedy drying  it s just a really pretty hair dryer  it s got an attractive black matte finish that s soft to the touch  it also features pretty pink pearlescent buttons and accents  br    br   conclusion  i recommend this hair dryer to those who are looking for a quiet  yet powerful hair dryer to streamline their morning routine  i had this same hair dryer for over ten years before it stopped working  so i replaced it with the same model   i only wish there were more color options  but for the quality the price can t be beat  best hairdryer going  big powerfull  lasts yaears and years  br    br   this is about teh third one i have purchased and i hope they keep making them   easy to install and use  did whish they came in diferent colors would reccomend to use in any bathroom  i think i might get one for my shop  to heat materials prior to gluing  br   skip kempf own this for a while  no problems so far  worked as well as it did on the first day i purchased it  some nice features for the money this hair dryer will take the abuse of flying 20  through the air and smashing me in the head  very durable and she likes the retracting cord  it is a good dryer  for the size of it  it has good drying power  it is easy to pack for trips  i tried this at a beautiful  luxury hotel in newport  ri  and it was love for my naturally thick  somewhat frizzy hair   it came out straight and smooth and oh so shiny   i knew i wanted one   told the bf how much i loved it and he ended up going to the hotel on one of his next trips and they sold him a new one from housekeeping right from the hotel   that was almost two years ago and it s still  all that  in my book   retractable cord still retracts like a champ   my hair dries nicely  easily  no fuss   the weight seems fine to me   i ve had high end  200 hair dryers and have no recollection of them being even remotely better than this little baby   for the price  this is a steal  bought this as stocking stuffer and daughters luv luv it   great gift and actually has removable lint screen which a lot of blow dryers don t have   will buy another one soon because 1 blow dryer for 2 girls doesn t quite do it     lol powerful dryer and easy to install  at a good price   keeps the cord off the counter and frees up counter space  this is the first time that i ve spent over  30 for a hair dryer  i was really looking forward to using this  i have had this hair dryer for 1 month  and i have to say that my biggest complaint is the nozzle attachment keeps falling off which is very aggravating   other than that i love how quick it dries my hair  and it does make my hair look more smoother   i have thick wavy curly frizzy hair  the price on this was about 30  lower than the same model in the store  so considering the price it was a great choice  my only   34 complaint  34  is that the low setting is a little too low  and the high setting is a little too high for my preference  a speed right between the two would be ideal  but that is a minor issue  it works well for what i need  this replaced my previous hair dryer  same brand and model  that had lasted many years   my wife couldn t live without it  the good  powerful  fast drying that leaves hair feeling good  br    br   the bad  too much power on the low speed leaves lots of flyaways and substantially reduces control over the finished style  br    br   this hairdryer has a lot of power  which is great for getting your hair from wet to damp quickly  the problem is that this hairdryer has too much power on the low speed for a polished set and style  br    br   i wanted a hairdryer that would complete the first 50  of hair drying quickly  but then allow me to use a lower speed with my round brush to get a smooth finish  this dryer just has too much power going to it at the low speed setting  which means i get lots of flyaways  if you always flat iron or curl after drying  or if you don t care about style and just want to get your hair dry fast  or  maybe  if you have really thick strands  this could be a great dryer  with my medium fine hair  i just can t get that polished set that i m looking for  my hair does feel nice after i dry it  and if i m planning to curl or flat iron after drying then i really appreciate how fast i can get my hair dry  however  i don t like that i must flat iron or curl my hair to get it to look finished  if this dryer had a third  lower speed setting  or if the low speed setting had 30  less power  this would be a great hairdryer  as it is  i break out my old vidal sassoon 1875 to finish the style  i got the remington when my vidal sassoon stopped working on   34 high  34  and would only work on   34 low  34    so convenient  seems to work just fine  had it for a month so far  easy to install and looks great too  i bought it because of the low price and beautiful color  but tne item s color is so different from the picture  the most feature that diappointed me is my hair always roll into the back of it and the dryer broke my hair a lot  i strongly recommended people do not buy this product  i just don t want bother to return it  this is the only reason i keep it  it s a little heavy but it s well made and easy to use  br   i like the smooth feeling of the surface  br   wish it was a little bit smaller lighter  bought this on a whim shopping at costco  i was in desperate need of a blow dryer  so anything would do  i just spent a ton of money on a vacuum  so a high end blow dryer was going to have to wait  i have to say after one use  i am very impressed  my other blow dryer was still working  but was causing my hair to frizz up horribly  i really wasn t expecting this blow dryer to work so quickly and efficiently  my hair is smoother and more manageable  note  i am also using salon quality shampoo and conditioner  so that helps a lot  bought this for my elderly mother  whose old hairdryer was heavy and bulky  she loves this one  it s light and much easier for a handicapped person to use  this dryer dries my long hair quickly and efficiently   i even notice less frizz than i used to  which is fantastic  my wife and i bought this for our travels in europe   it works well here in the u s   but much louder and hotter in europe   so far  it worked  though  very convenient and easy to setup  everything was in the box and the directions were easy to follow  i would definitely recommend especially as an investment to save money  no sales puffing with this product   it performs exactly as marketed and fits into small spaces   the retractable cord was a selling point for me  and it drys my hair quickly and thoroughly   i would have no reservation recommending this unit  i don t know what i ll think in six months if the dryer konks out on me   but for now  i couldn t be happier   i use the warm  low setting for my hair  and the results are great  smooth  non frizzy hair   my hair is fairly straight  but some dryers manage to make it look a little frizzy  which is a mystery to me   anyway  i m very pleased  and the price was excellent  i bought this for my most recent eurotrip   i used it in france  italy and spain with no problems  on the higher voltage setting    it is compact but not as light as i was expecting   using this higher setting gives you only one setting option   low   but the power over there is so strong that it feels more like high   even high though isn t that powerful  but gets the job done for basic drying purposes   probably not any fancy styles   make sure to set it to high with a screwdriver before you go  i had a heck of a time finding an object equivalent to a flat head screwdriver  br    br   in the states  this hair dryer isn t really worth using     34 low  34  is like someone blowing out their birthday cake candles and high is like   well   not much more than that   i will use this as my travel blow dryer only  i was unable to find a comparable product at the local big box stores  br    br   i was pleased to find this at a price that was approximately 50  less than other retailers and websites  br    br   works great and does not take up additional counter top in bathroom  compact  easy to hang and reliable  very powerful for the size  would recommend this to anyone needing a small hair dryer  i was in the market for a new hair dryer after my previous one gave out after a few years   i did considerable research  and was drawn to this one by the great reviews and the low price  br    br   this one is suitable  but i m going to keep looking for a new one  br    br   cons  br     it increased my drying time  i previously had an inexpensive revlon  br     even on the highest setting  the temperature does not get that hot br     it is a bit on the heavy side br    br   pros  br     the retractable cord is great for storage i love this hair dryer  it s fast at drying and quiet  it s a great tool for everyday drying and worth the money  i also bought the hair straightner and it s just as good  i hope onei keeps making great products like chi use too  i bought this after my brand new revlon hair dryer stopped working inexplicably   i was looking for a cheap hair dryer that i could use every few days when i need my hair dry faster than usual and that wouldn t crap out on me right after i bought it   it s 3 months later and it still works great  i don t really have many gripes about it   they only thing i ll mention is the   34 warm  34  setting seems a bit too cool for warm   i ve always used the warm setting in the past because i don t want to fry my hair with the   34 hot  34  setting and   34 cool  34  doesn t dry fast enough  with this hair dryer  i use   34 hot  34  more as the   34 warm  34  setting just doesn t cut it   other than that  great  i love the power this dryer has   cuts drying time by a third   nice folding handle if traveling is required as well as the short barrell   does not perform like a travel dryer   excellent  i recommend it  is a very good product i only work with the best  it worth the money  i m going to buy three more  i purchased this dryer because of a recommendations from a stylist  she commented that she loved it  before purchasing it  i read the reviews  some were happy  some complained about the dryer lasting a few days  well  that is what happened to me  upon receiving the dryer i noticed that it did not had temperature control  so i decided to return it since i did not like the lack of that feature  the company was eager to collaborate and refund the money to me even without asking me to return it  i was surprised and said to myself  wow this company is really different  from others  in terms of customer service  however  i used it one more time and the breakers blew and the dryer stopped working all together  the dryer lasted exactly three days  from the moment i received it to the moment  it stopped working  i was happy that i initiated the return earlier without me than knowing this unfortunate circumstance  might happened  i believed this product does not have a good quality control from the manufacturer  since more of one review complained about the same  from the reviews it would appear that the product used to be good and some  customers were happy with it like the stylist that recommended the dryer to me but  now it looks that quality fell very very low  i ve had this hairdryer for a year and a half   i love the settings and how quickly it dries my hair   it didn t last as long as i d hoped  however   it just started popping and shooting fire out of the end  this is light  quiet  effective  several options for heat and speed settings   everything you need  top rated by consumer reports  it does the trick however high is not as high as most hair dryers and when you put it to blow hot air it s not hot at all more like warm very light warm     i oove it   works great  plenty of blow power and love the added bonus of the night light  i would recommend this product for purchase  i used this powerful  1875 watts  dual voltage 125 250 blower in cuba last week  along with a separate plug adaptor  it worked perfectly  just turn the button on the handle with maybe a knife  or other instrument  to 250v setting  and use on high or low settings  br   this is a great product for me  i don t like the blow dryers usually found in hotels outside the us  you need to continuously press on the power button to keep it on  because it s awkward scrunching my hair into the diffuser with my other hand  also  the diffuser is high quality with twelve prongs  br   it s not exactly tiny in size once it s open  but is slightly smaller than my regular blower  and it s great the handle folds  br    br   when travelling  it s the small conveniences that make me happy  and this blower did just that  this does not hurt your hair  very well suited for daily use  if you are looking for any specific style dryiers  this is the best one for everyday use  i bought this conair to replace an older model that i had had for over 10 years  the is slightly smaller than the older 1875 model but i prefer that  the folding arm functions well and the high setting is perfect for those fast blow dry mornings  it drys your hair fast and its not too laud   easy to move around if you need to use it anywhere in the house  i have purchased two of these blow dryers  one for myself and the other as a gift  the hsi works well  dries hair quickly  the controls are easy to use and the cord is longer than any other i have purchased  i have noticed that my hair is smoother than when dried with my last dryer  a babyliss pro  both of us are happy with the hsi  i would purchase again  this dryer is lightweight by very powerful   it dries my hair very fast on a low setting so i have less breakage  best hair dryer ever  my hair has been so easy to manage with it especially with my very very thick hair   i would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone  this hairdryer is working out well for me  it is hard for me to believe that the ionic conditioning feature really works but it really seems to   my hair has less static in it after i use this dryer on it  this winter has seemed unusually static filled so this is a welcome relief  this hair dryer is awesome   it doesn t get too hot and dries my hair very nicely and was exactly what i was looking for   very pleased    i like it because it is not a noisy hair dryer  it works fine and does have a comfort touch  i have bought two of these  one to keep at my boyfriend s place too   they pack well and are wonderful  very convenient for travel  and dry my hair very quickly  this was my favorite blow dryer  i had it for a few years and then it died on me  i couldn t find it in the stores anymore so i turned to amazon  yay  got my fav dryer back and it works perfectly    i have had this hair dryer every day for a long time and it is the best  i use it with the nice difusser that comes with it and my hair has beautiful curls   i would highly recommend it for people that want to have pretty soft curls when using a difusser  i do not use it for anything else  i have had people borrow it to dry straight hair and they say it is great  everything i expected   a very good product   for the price this is a very good purchase and i give it a good rating reasonably priced and powerful  one of the best in the same class  impressed with the separate control of speed and temp for this price this hair dryer is powerful and does an excellent job  however  i bought one for my wife which i received on january 7th 2014  my wife used it 4 times and then it burned  literally there was smoke coming from the back of the unit and it stopped working  i contacted amazon and they are sending a replacement unit  it could be that the unit was defective and the replacement will last longer  but  my rating will stay as 1 star until we can proof otherwise  i did a lot of research  this is the narrowest one  the 2 speed 3 heat settings are great  very nice for a small space  it s great   it s kinda loud but a great product   would buy another  loved the red  the cord goes back up the dryer  loved that feature  does everything i need it to do  light and easy to use  i love  the attachments too  dries nicely and fast  i have medium length  fine curly hair and needed a low setting and warm air and good diffuser that won t sit right on your hair   check  check and check  perfect for drying while not blowing your hair around so to break the curl or cause frizz  and it s lightweight  a real gem  appears well made  has a good fan speed and heats up well for a compact dryer   nice to have a hook to hold the cable  i like having the dryer on my wall instead of my dresser  it is not as powerful as my old dryer so takes a minute longer but i do like it  this item is a very good product  the price is right for this dryer  ergonimics make it easy to use and hold  i had no idea how cheap my hair dryer was till i used this one  i bought this for my daughter for christmas and tried it  it worked great  i liked hers so much i bought one for myself  really like this hair dryer   does not frizz hair when drying  can be used with or without several dryer attachments  like all silver color   controls are well placed and very easy to use   has really long cord which helps   a little heavy  but i m in my sixties  but its weight not a real problem   hangs up easily when not in use  highly recommend this hair dryer   price reflects quality  value and great find  only been in use for couple of months but wife is happy so far  hope it lasts  more words ok the style looks sheik hanging on wall  looks good and very quiet  i like the nite light that s built into it  great value for the money  bigger than most travel size blow dryers but the folding handle is still a great feature and still helps with space  the three speeds is a bonus too  i ve read some reviews that say the retractable cord stopped working after a week  but i ve had absolutely no trouble and it s been a couple of months  i m wondering if those people are retracting the cord before or after they fold the handle   it seems to me it should be done before to give the cord a clear path   all in all a great purchase  our blow dryer died recently  panic   but we just didn t have the opportunity to hunt around in local stores to find a replacement for the one we d had for so long  i took a chance and looked on amazon and there it was     the exact one we wanted  it has a lot of power and we re very pleased with it  good hair dryer and i liked the different attachments and settings  however  i had this hair dryer a few years ago and worked fine for quite a while  one day while drying my hair  it popped and started to smoke  i immediately unplugged it  looked it over and saw the cord was melted near the handle  it was throw away since it was fried  without thinking  i went out and bought a second one since the first one lasted so long  and thought maybe the sparking incident was a fluke   this morning  the same thing happened to me while using it  it sparked and and there was a pop   again i turned it off and unplugged it immediately  i looked it over  and the cord had melted away from where it attached to the handle  dangerous  while the price is right  it is not worth the fire risk   so far so good   i ve had it a few weeks now and it s still working good  blowing really hot  quick dry time  this was a good purchase for the money and for what i needed   i don t use a dryer daily so i didn t want to spend another  150 for a hairdryer for which i wasn t going to use often   high setting is very hot so i use the medium which is more than hot enough   a little light weight which isn t really a bad thing   i was used to my old dryer which was a professional  heavier dryer  dryer is great for the money  it is quiet gets hot and seems to compare to the chi dryer we also have in the salon  thank you so much  the final test will be life span  dries my thick hair very quickly  it makes quick work of straightening my hair while blow drying  leaves my hair shiny  it s an awesome dryer  seems like it s of good quality  low setting takes too long to dry long hair  definitely would be better without the night light  or if there was a switch to turn the light off  i have very thick hair  this hair dryer works amazingly  and it s really convenient to bring for travel because of its tiny size  i love it and will absolutely buy again  it is nice and compact  however not showing in the description on line is that it will only run in low speed when using the 220 voltage   this wouldn t work with my hair therefore i had to return it  dryer works as intended and is more useful than a salon style dryer in that it s portable   i also think using a bonnet as opposed to salon style dryer is more efficient in drying the hair due to creating a closed hair drying environment   however  that s just my opinion  i don t have anything to prove that   the only negative that i have relative to bonnet style dryer is    from experience    the bonnet wears tears up before the dryer breaks and i haven t been able to get replacement bonnets  i bought this for my mom br   she searched on line and found this one br   it was exactly what she was looking for br   works great it dries my hair so fast   i love it and would recommend this product to anyone who wants a good hair dryer at a low price  but i don t  the biggest thing is that it just doesn t dry  i put it on and then take my sweet time putting on makeup so that this thing has plenty of time to do its thing  but my hair comes out about as wet as if i d wrapped it in a microfiber towel for a few minutes  which is to say  maybe 10 percent dry  not dripping  but definitely wet and not damp   there are other things i don t like about it  such as the hose doesn t fasten to the cap  just rests in the opening without any kind of clip or click or anything  which means paying attention to how much i move around to be sure the hose doesn t fall out of the cap  or that the hose is so short that the base has to be sitting pretty close to me the whole time  for now  i ll stick with my hard bonnet dryer on a floor stand  doesn t allow for much mobility  but it s way more effective at actually drying  this dryer works great and has a lot of power  for  10 00    you can t beat that   it s also a  bit smaller than most dryers so it s easy to hold and maneuver  this hair dryer is the great things that can use the less time to make my long hair dry  i love it best hair dryer ever  super high power  i dunno if it has something to do with the   34 ionize  34  part   but it actually thickens up my hair  i m 46 and it s getting a little thinner up top and man this thing does wonders for bringing a fullness to my hair  can t go wrong with this one  first i will say that it dries hair just like any other hair dryer so i guess it does what it s supposed to do   but  the use of toggle switches for power and temperature right on the handle instead of a sliding switch seems like poor planning at best   every time i change hand positions i m accidentally turning it off or moving it from hot to warm   the only way to avoid doing that is to not put your hand around the inside of the handle   i ve dropped the dumb thing on the floor more times than i can count while trying to avoid turning it off   all other dryers i ve ever used have switches that slide up or down and only move when you want them to  not just if you accidentally touch it   and the cord is very short as well   much shorter than any i ve had in the past   this dryer will be going to   34 back up  34  status as soon as i get a better replacement  i have very fine hair that doesn t like to be styled  using this dryer  i have  br    br   volume br   body br   curl br    br   and  i don t have to use any product to get it that way  i believe the key is not only the dryer  but  the shampoo you use  i use a keratin infused shampoo with ion ultra light weight conditioner  bottom line  this blow dryer is incredible  this is great for a smaller bathroom   like i have   and it mounted easily on the wall and i use it daily  this is my favorite blow dryer ever  it does the job and i love the different parts that you can use from the big tooth  little tooth or brush  also  you can have it on cool air as well which is different and pretty cool  it works great on my african american 4c hair  i love this hair dryer  it is a bit heavier than my previous one but my hair dreys faster so i don t mind   the air blows really hot if you use the highest setting so it took a bit getting used to it  but i love it so far it is all that it promised works well  and is very compacted would i recommend it yes   very pleased    this works great and has really helped cut down on my static  also my hair feels so much better now that i am not using my cheapie blow dryer  after using the onei flat iron i decided to see what other onei products i could purchase  this blow dryer is fabulous  i have a lot of hair and because of the dryers power  my blow dry time has been shortened  every time i use this dryer i feel like i am at a salon because the blow dryer is top of the line  no more blow dry bars for me  i am more then happy to blow dry my own hair with the onei hair dryer  with a reasonable price  this conair hair dryer is good  have tried it for couple times  it did perform a great work  it s the perfect size   a great weight   retractable   the handle folds   it drys very well   best hair dryer ever   after reading some of the bad reviews i was reluctant to buy it but i m sure glad i did  this is a nice hair dryer  i use it on warm high  it still takes a while to get my hair dry  still  with dryer  it is much smoother than with my last con air  i m a big world traveller   this is the best one i ve used  small   lightweight  seemed about right the right price  i can t find this at my local store anymore and i just love it    so glad i found it here and bought this as a backup   works well and seems to last a long time  have had about 4 of them so far over the years     wouldn t use anything else if i can help it  the conair 1875 watt turbo styler with ionic conditioning is quite strong    also the price is nice  so i really like it light weight  quickly dries your hair and runs quietly  i also love the attachments that come with it   great deal  when i first purchased this hair blower  i had doubts as the price was very reasonable  when it was finially installed  it worked very well  perhaps not as fancy as the more exspensive units  but for the most part it is very good  i highly recomend this hair blower this hair dryer folds up nicely  the cord retracts smoothly   the settings are also perfect and do not burn my hair  love this hair dryer  perfect for travel because of what little space it takes up and the retractable cord is a blessing  works as promised  i also looked at it and thought i had received a toy hairdryer  but it works works works  i took it with me on my trip to wa and all three family members used it daily  it is quick  it does not cause fizz or flyaways  the attachments are plastic but for the price it works wonderfully  will buy again and recommend it to the ladies     ps  the zebra bag was a delight to use for travel and for personal when travel is over     the retractable cord is already stalling out on me and i just got the hair dryer   it works great but don t expect miracles with the cord  i have been looking for a good replacement for my old remington hair dryer   i finally found it  i love it because it dries my hair super fast  it has very strong blowing power   my hair dries silky   straight just how i like it  this dryer is also pretty quiet  it doesn t have that loud high pitched noise like most dryers do  it might be a little heavy to some people that are not used to professional hair dryers but the weight doesn t bother me  it weighs the same as my old one  i m not sure why some people wrote reviews about the dryer sucking in their hair  i have had no issues with that whatsoever  i am very happy with this hair dryer   i highly recommend it to others  i ve only used this dryer for a few weeks  but so far so good  i have long thick hair and only need to use medium speed on medium heat to get everything dry in 10 minutes  the ongoing polar vortex combined with my own bleary negligence every morning is a pretty good litmus test for any product  but i ve only gotten my hair stuck in it once and it s not so hot i ve damaged my hair  when all is said and done  i m fairly impressed  with the dryer  not myself  love the travel hair dryer  it folds down to take up less place  the diffuser works great with my curly hair and it has hot cold air options  i love this hair dryer   it dries my hair fast  and makes my hair very shiny and straight   i used to use revlon hair drier from drug store which is about  15   revlon hair dryer usually stops working after one year from purchase and makes my hair very dry and unhealthy   this panasonic hair dryer is a little pricy compared to regular dryer you can get from drug store but you get what you pay for   it s worth it   the finish of the body prevents your fingerprints to stick even though you have hair cream or hand cream on your hand so you can keep the beautiful appearance of the dryer  i feel my hair has been healthier and shinier with this   i highly recommend this product  i love this brand and model of hairdryer  i had a blue one exactly like this for about 5 years  and it was the most durable hairdryer i ve ever had  i would say this one was not as hot as my last  but still a very decent hairdryer  i would definitely recommend  my hair has never been shiner and instantly silkier  i was honestly shocked  i used to blow dry my hair with an ionic hair dryer but sedu s ionizer is drasticly different  i use  2 setting  hot  first to get rid of excess moisture and then finish with  1  warm  while using a boars bristle brush  i used to spend a long time drying  only to end up with large   frizzy hair  and then spend even more time using a flat iron and my hair never even came near the smoothness   utter silkiness that using the sedu revolution has afforded me  i have not once used my flat iron since the first use of this ionic dream of a hair dryer  my boyfriend literally was amazed as well when he saw me after less than 10 minutes of use   and he couldn t stop touching my hair  br   i ve never written a review like this but i hope if that you are on the fence due to the price   give it a try and you will not be disappointed  we were using japanese brand hair dryer before this but it broke so we had to get another one  i don t know it s all american brand or what but this thing is soooo loud   i was watching video on my laptop in the next door and i could not hear the video even with max volume  it does dry the hair up real nice but it just really loud   we were just so used to japanese brand high quality quiet hair dryer  this thing is a monster  if you don t care about the loudness  go for it  it does work like it advertise  as a dryer works awesome  i find it very handy for my daily hair drying  my grand daughter comes here when she is in a hurry to dry her hair  this hair dryer makes my hair nice and smooth  i always tried to avoid any hair dryer  because they all made my hair frizzier  this hair dryer got my attention in the store  so i went on line at amazon  found good reviews and good price and i bought it  i couldn   believe  when i got such a nice result after the first time i used it  i am using right now for 2 months and i am still happy with it  no regrets  the concept of this hair dryer is great   retractable cord  folds for travel  ceramic technology  etc   it works well when it works  however its only good for 6 months to a year   i bought my first one in may 2012 and it blew up in dec 2012   bought a replacement in dec 2012 and this one just blew up in jan 2014   blew up   pop  fizzle  smoke   i like the hair dryer  but there s an obvious trend i m not willing to risk anymore  br    br     update   after reading some of the other reviews  i learned about the 5 year warranty   i contacted andis  and all i had to do was send in my amazon receipt   they sent out two new hairdryers within days   i am happily using the hair dryer again and have a spare   i upgraded from 3 to 4 stars based on the fantastic warranty and customer service  i really like this hair dryer not only because it is designed for travel but that it has better air flow than any other hair dryer my wife has bought  these things are disposable and at this price that makes that part more than acceptable  i love it  i really do   what more can i say  i mounted it on the wall and have used it since i got it  thank you  purchased this model because it had all the features i was looking for  after about 5 weeks it will not heat up only blows barely warm air  i love this blow dryer  i wanted one i didn t have to put away every day or have lying around with the cord all bunched up  this fit the bill perfectly  it s on the wall  out of the way and always ready  saw this at first in a great hotel and ordered right when i got home   love the wattage   the look  br   the compactness and easy storage      does exactly what it needs to do  solid and durable  gets so hot makes you wanna smack yo mama  buy it  i had an andis hair dryer for at least 8 years until it died on me recently  br   the replacement is wonderful  product still as reliable as it was before  very powerful and dries hair fast   i purchased this for my mom and she absolutely loves it   the wall mount is very handy so it doesn t need rolled up every day like traditional ones  i was hesitant to buy ths hair dryer because its only 1875 watts  i started to buy a 2000 watt dryer  but chose this one instead      i have shoulder length hair and this hair dryer dries my hair in about 6 minutes   i love the color and also the fact that it has different heat settings and speeds   so glad i purchased it i also use this hair dryer   i like it better than the 1 we originally had  but my daughter doesn t think it puts out as much air   so since i m the 1 writing the review  i give it 5 stars   love the retractable cord  after a few years of use my old hair dryer died on me  so i got this one  its been working great so far  it has a few attachments with it to help you with different styles  bought it for the girl friend for when she stays here  she likes it and she has a fair amount of thick hair  2 temperature settings and a hi low fan switch  unit does its job  i bought this dryer for travel but  i am using it regularly at home   it s good weight although it s not lighter than my  regular  dryer   i had hoped for a little less weight but i like it anyway   i also noticed that it is far quieter than my old dryer   although not essential  it was good to find something besides black   why are colors so hard to find   this is definitely a  thumbs up  34  product  this is a great hair dryer  the light is a nice feature  it is a bit bright though as i already purchased one of these a couple of yrs ago and the light was better  this is a professional hair dryer  it dries hair quickly and it lasts and can be repaired  i would highly recommend it  very good i really like it also used for facial which is amazing  kinda expensive  but worth the money haha this product id great  really dries your hair without frizzing  only complaint is its a little heavy  but all in all great dryer as i tolld you before   this item came broken and had to trash it   haven t the foggiest if it was any good or not  i love this drier as it is compact  folds  takes little space in the suitcase and works well  i don t use it often as it stays in my suitcase and is ready for the next trip  i discovered this hair dryer while on a vacation with my husband  it was a high end hotel that we stayed in  i was in need of a new dryer and the power this one emitted was exceptional  the retractable cord is a bonus  it s not the quietest hair dryer but  it isn t obnoxious  either  you gotta expect some noise with that much power  i love it  it s so nice to be able to have the cord wind itself up inside the dryer and out of the way  i am on my second one of these  i love them so much  i had the original for five years and it started to make a little noise  didn t want to be without one  so i ordered a second   my best friend is still using it and i have my new one  purchased this travel iron after my previous one burned up   this one is compact and i love the retractable cord   i have very thick hair and was pleased to find a travel iron with 1875 watts  it dries hair very quickly and without frizz but is too loud  also there are 2 speeds but heat isn t adjustable  lower speed means less heat  this dryer is different than any dryer i have had before  first off its very light  second it doesn t ruin your hair like normal dryers do with high heat  this still produces heat but not like the old dryers that will burn your hair off  don t buy  product stopped working after using it only 2 times   waste of time and money   very disapointed   had good reviews but certainly didn t live up to them   i love the color and the convent hanging loop the switches could be simpler and larger it s a light in weight product  frankly  i used to have a conair 1875 watts that was much better than this one   it barely could blow and definitely not hot enough   i gave it to my mom since it s small and very light and she doesn t have much hair  but it was unusable for me   still searching for a good hair blower    pretty nifty for my weekend cabin guesthouse and great for my rv  just like the ones at the hotels  nice to have it on the wall and out of the way  i have used this hairdryer many times in many hotel and have always been pleased  br   it s comfortable  looks sharp  and has different settings  br   i bought 1 for each bathroom in my new home   near the beach   family and friends will have the br   convenience of not having to travel with a hairdryer  this hair dryer is heavy  and pretty huge  also  it s hard to hold it by the handle because the rocker switches for power and heat are in the way of your fingers  so you have to practice in order to not change the settings during use  when set on hot high  the velocity of the air is very good  but it s not hot at all    the air is barely warm    which is fine for drying  but certainly not good for styling  it did minimize my static flyaway hair  but since i had to use my old   34 hot  34  dryer to style  i lost that benefit and had to add leave in conditioner to de electrify my hair  the price was good  hence the two stars  but i don t recommend  probably better for short hair  bought this to replace my  extremely  old dryer  this thing is fantastic  it now only takes me 10 minutes to dry my hair  after its air dried for a while but still  and gotta love aa product that supports such a good cause  i was looking for a lightweight and quiet dryer   this is perfect   although i do not need the long cord now  it would have been great in other bathrooms   love the quiet    it is replacing an old brookstone that was very quiet but also pretty heavy  i love the look and the power of the dryer but something about the ion makes my hair greasy  other then that it s a great product  this hairdryer did not hold up well   the attachments do not stay on very well and the plastic around the handle is peeling off   i would not recommend  this thing dries my hair super quick  cuts my morning routine in half and my hair is way smoother since i bought this  doesn t get super hot but very powerful  i never realized how much difference a good hair dryer makes on your hair   i m a cancer survivor and have been growing out my hair   i needed a new hair dryer and i didn t want another one from the drugstore   i started researching hair dryers on the internet and kept reading about the onei hair dryer  i love the different settings and it s light weight in your hand  just wish it had a retractable cord  it s a great medium priced product   you certainly could pay a lot more for a hair dryer but the onei is perfect   my daughter has this dryer and it worked so well i wanted one  fast  fast  fast  and i have a lot of hair  been using this dryer for the past 6 months and it s works great  the hot setting is not   34 burn your scalp hot  34  but warm enough to dry your hair rapidly  great for styling hair also  this product was the perfect size for me to take on my vacation abroad   it took very little room to pack it and worked well  this has the performance i was looking for   i have fine  straight hair that i blowdry almost daily and this has the power to not only cut down my drying time but also makes it so i dont have to use the flat iron as much because it powers out the waves i do have  br   i do sometimes hit the cool button by accident while drying because of where its located on the handle but i can live with that  br   my sister had this dryer before me and i had to copy her   the only con i would say is it doesnt get super hot but my daughter loves that about it when i blowdry her hair  purchased based on reviews and two features   folding handle and retracting cord   useful in the home and for travel  performs as advertised and rated  i love this hair dryer   it is quiet  there are 3 temperature settings  hot warm cold  and 2 speed settings   i love the retracting cable  which allows for easy uncluttered storage   i did have to get used to holding it securely while i pressed the button on the side to retract the cable  though  dropping it the first time  because i didn t have a good hold on it   i had really long hair when i first got it  and then i cut my hair super short recently  so i have yet to figure out how the diffuser works   i can t wait to try it for some wavier locks once my hair grows out   this is definitely a good price for a great product  this is the best gift my sis says she loves it thanks for this product it is a winner  thanks again  i purchased this over a year ago and my husband and i are very pleased with the results has a very professional look and performance i was looking for a travel hairdryer   this is the only hairdryer that i could find that had the retractable cord   that does making packing much nicer along with the folding handle   the handle just pulls down and pushes back up easily   no buttons etc   it does stay in place when using it   super duper drying power  br   product dimensions  4 1 x 8 1 x 6 1 inches   1 6 pounds br   that said it is bigger and heavier than i wanted for travel but getting smaller like i have had in the past  and can t find  didn t work nearly as well   i am one half star down because the size seems large for travel which would be the point of the design i would think  br   all in all  its a great dryer and the best i have found for travel and function  i ve only had this a couple weeks but  so far  it s living up to expectations   very strong on high   dries my long hair quickly and is quieter than my old one  this dryer is so easy to handle  dries your hair quickly without drying it out  like regular blow dryers do    it also gets your hair pretty straight  so you only have to go over it with a ceramic flat iron for a more intense shine or control of the ends of your hair  curl or flip or bend  etc     this is a terrific unit  it has separate heat and power adjustments   can be strong or gentle  dried my thick medium length hair in 3 minutes  every bit as good as units costing 4x as much  why would you buy anything else  my previous conair lasted over 10 years  i used one of these for 6 years   it worked well  so when the first one died  i bought another  but after 6 months of normal use it died and i now need a third one  will try a different brand this time  i love my andis blow dryer   this thing is great  it gets super hot  has good settings you can adjust if you don t want the hot feature  and it really is professional quality  even though i feel like all blow dryers say  professional     this has really been a staple  espically since trying to transition from relaxed to natural hair   the cord could be a tad longer  but i would have a 30 foot cord on all my gadgets if possible so it may just be me   i would recommend this dryer  i only use one nozzle for it though  i feel like the other nozzles it came with don t fit  however i could just be mixing them up because i ve had so many blow dryers throughout the years  it has great power for such a little hair dryer   i have very thick long hair and it does a great job  this was a requested item for my daughter for christmas  i don t use this so i can t comment on them personally  i have not heard from her as to whether she doesn t like this so that is a plus  please check out the other purchasers that use this for a more concise review  i m always glad when i can shop on amazon for anything it saves me time  gas  and delivery issues  i gave this to my daughter that is going to college and storage is a big concern   she has only had this for about 3 weeks  but i love the cord storage feature  daughter wanted this hairdryer   she loves it   compact and easy to hold   color scheme is great   decent price compared to what is found in stores  i don t know if its lack of skills on my part or lack of quality in this product but it just doesn t do what i expected  also  when i used the highest setting i literally  not exaggerating  burned skin off my thumb  i don t know if i touched the dryer or my hair while it was hot because when it happened i didn t feel it at first  i don t want to return it because i m still hoping i can make it work for me  br   when i get someone who knows how to make my hair look the way i want with this dryer i ll update  tried many dryers  this one seems the best i had  salient point  hair does not burn  it dries  which is what a dryer should do  this was a great portable option for travel within the us  however  as soon as i took it out of the country  and switched to the 220v setting and plugged in  it started having issues  the first time it got so hot that it literally melted a part of the diffuser attachment  after that it just stopped blowing unless the   34 cool  34  button was pressed  now that i am back in the us  it is still not back to normal  it barely blows at all  and the light is flickering and unsteady  very unreliable  i used to have a babyliss  conair s high end line  and it started giving me problems roughly 4 weeks into having it  after a while i got fed up with the babyliss and decided to purchase this well rated hair dryer  br   i like that there are three temperature settings  good air flow  and two attachments for channeled or diffused air  i have curly hair  so i use both attachments and are happy with their performance  another great thing about this product is that i can feel safe that the intake side won t suck up my long hair and result in unfortunate hair loss  the mesh is good quality and in a tight configuration  the intake is also very easy to ope close  which makes it easy to clean out any dust that may accumulate overtime  whenever i clean the intake  i feel like my hair dryer is new since the air flow is so good after cleaning  br   i have had this hair dryer for over a year and would repurchase it for the price and functionality  for the money its fine  ind of small  powerfull  design and color are great cord is short too  ont be far from out let my daughter bought this for me for christmas   the color is generic  but i must say  it works fabulously   a lot of heat  a lot of air  and i can also easily push a button for cool air with my thumb to set a curl with a round brush   i can turn it off and on and off again to re roll my hair with both hands  without it refusing to turn back on until the entire machine cools down 10 minutes later   i can set my hair with it in about 5 minutes   electric cord works great with it  too  this was a gift and i couldn t have chosen a better product myself   i am able to dry my hair in about half the time w o a lot of frizz   it is light weight and the placement of the controls are perfect  no accidental control switching while holding and styling   never heard of this company but you won t be disappointed   give it a try  this is such an amazing hair dryer  it does my hair so fast and doesn t leave it with any static  i will buy this dryer again when i need to  the product itself is a 4   5 star product  it is just right for my wife s needs and the night light is a welcome plus  the 3 stars was for installation  i found the wall stud to screw the back plate into the wall for security  i drilled the holes  then pulled out the included screws and to my surprise found out that the holes were way too small for the screws to fit through  i had to go to the shop and drill out the holes bigger  this took several trips as i wanted to make sure they weren t too big so the small screw head would just go through the hole  very frustrating and oh  so avoidable by the company  once installed  the plate makes it easy to get the product on and off the wall  i hope it is fixed in the future  if this had been for an older woman without a knowledge of drilling out metal  this would have been a return  the main feature of this dryer that i find most appealing is the power   the air flow is strong and steady which expediates the hair drying process when minutes matter   i also enjoy the retractable cord and folding capability    an asset for storage and travel  has different settings for temperature and power  works great so far and comes with the extra parts  which i haven t yet used   i purchased this dryer for a relative and i did not really like it   i noticed that the retractable cord does not work exactly right and sometime does not work at all   i see paint coming off   i am told this hairdryer is really hot in temperature  perhaps to hot for hair drying   did not meet my expectations   i would not recommend dryer to a friend or relative    prompt delivery   r  dawson got this for my mom for her birthday  br    br   it works great and she has given many compliments about it   good dryer apparently  was looking for a small  lightweight hair dryer and this fits the bill perfectly   easy to handle and store and enough power to get the job done   very pleased and satisfied with this purchase  night light is just enough to see but not keep you awake  hair dryer is great  installs either with screws or tape  i got this as a christmas gift in 2013 and love it      easy to assemble  not really loud  and super convenient because you can set it up any where in the house   not restricted to sitting at a table to get your hair done  great hair dryer that has lasted me 5  years and it is still going strong  the heat and power settings make this hair dryer very versatile for many hair styles  my days of buying  20 or less hair dryers from the big box stores are over   i have long thick hair that takes forever to dry   i have taken to wearing a pony tail far too often because it is such a pain to dry my hair   i am very sensitive to loud noises and really hate high pitched wails   hairdryers always made me cringe and using low speed is not an option for my hair   i got this home and immediately plugged it in to find it has a lower pitched noise that is absolute music to my ears   it will not drive me nuts and i will no longer feel like i am waking anyone up in the house using it   it also cranks out the air and has excellent settings to power through my drying   thanks amazon for changing my life through exposure to products that actually work  i have spent the past few months researching several different hair dryers and finally decided on this one  i m so glad i did  i have super thick  coarse  long  wavy curly hair and have been using a cheap drugstore dryer for the past several years  i m not sure why i never realized that a good hair dryer could make such a difference  but i really wish i had figured it out sooner  i learned this lesson a few years ago when it comes to hair straighteners  i have the t3 mane tamer that i absolutely adore  so  i started there  t3 has a few different dryers  all with positive ratings  and all very expensive  i wasn t convinced that it would be worth it to spend that much  i read through tons of reviews for this onei hair dryer and was happy with the positive reviews and the price  it arrived quickly and i couldn t wait to get it out of the box and use it  normally  i spend a good half hour to 45 mins just getting my hair dry  not blowing it out  not using any brushes or styling tools techniques  just getting it dry so that i can use my flat iron  the result  before flat ironing  is what i like to call my   34 white girl afro  34   it is big  it is fluffy and it is crazy  br   after reading some reviews and q as  i switched on the negative ion button  got my round brush and went to town  i could not believe how smooth my hair got just from blowing it dry  my technique was sadly out of practice and i did end up using my flat iron on a few spots  but i think that was entirely user error and expect it to get better with a little practice  i really believe that  once i get used to blowing my hair out again  i will be able to dry and style my hair with no flat iron required   br   my hair was so smooth and very shiny in the end  i was so happy with it  the dryer itself is lightweight and comfortable to hold and use and i love all the options it has with heat cool  fan speed  etc  the buttons are perfectly located for my taste  not in the way at all and no risk of accidentallypushing buttons while using  i also love that there is both a cool shot  if you just need a quick blast of cool air  and a cool temperature setting  for when you want cool air for an extended period of time   i was also really impressed with how quiet this dryer is  when i first turned it on  it actually made me a little nervous because it was so quiet and i was afraid it wouldn t be very powerful  but that is definitely not the case  plenty of power without all the noise  br   i am very  very happy with this hair dryer and would absolutely recommend it  we travel a lot  and wanted a multi voltage hair drier that will also work on 220 volt  the handle folds  and it is a wonderful addition to our travel  i have wanted a new dryer for ages  but kept waiting because i couldn t decide on what to get   this conair is a great choice   i never realized a dryer could actually be quiet   do such a great job on thin  flat hair  br   the hair dryer is so quiet  compared to my old one   my hair is smoother with no static electricity   a really nice dryer   the defuser makes my hair fuller than it really is  bought this as a gift for someone and they loved it  i even tried it out myself and want one of my own  pricey  but amazing  this hair dryer is everything i hoped it would be   it is simple to use and does the job   i have my hair professionally colored and highlighted   i have used blow dryers  hot curling irons and hot rollers for many years but the curl and body i get from hair rollers and this dryer is way better and stays curly longer   my hair actually feels like it did when i was younger   my only complaint is the dryer came with a broken clip that holds one wheel  of the stand  on and no instruction booklet for use   i would like to have these things  if possible  i love this blow dryer   i will be getting another one for my guest bathroom  it s very powerful and i have never had any problems with it  i broke my very old hair dryer  also 1875 watts  and was looking for a good replacement  this one was surprisingly cheap but doesn t look that way in person  the matte finish look and feels lovely in your hands  and it has some weight to it so you don t feel like it s going to break if you wave it around  i have shoulder blade length hair and it can dry my hair in 2 3 minutes flat  we had our old conair for years and loved it  so i got a replacement   the new one keeps flipping the fuse switch in the switch box  so all the lights and electric go off in the bathroom  so i ve had to stop using our master bathroom to dry my hair  which is ridiculous   i m getting rid of it and getting something that doesn t cause this many problems   i tried to be a loyal customer  but this is how i m repaid  by a crummy product   we re done with conair  i have gone through too many of these dryers  it is my favorite in terms of how great it blows hair straight  but they break too easily and for that price  i had to go with something that i don t like as much but that lasts  mine burnt out within 2 months and i could not return it by the time i got back into the country from my travels  this is a great product  works better than my full size blow dryer  and the carrying bag just makes it that much better  wattage not too high and just the right size   it s small enough to tote to the pool in my gym bag  but large enough to do a great job at home  too   i have had it a couple of years now   it looks like it might continue to work  unlike so many other electrical products in this day and age of globalized manufacturing   i cannot tell you hiow much money i spend just trying to get away from products made by slave labor  i bought the dryer to dry my pets after washing them  it works well  dries quickly  has the ceramic heating element and and ion drying feature as the more expensive models  durabilty is another variable that i can t access  the bearing in my wife s blow dryer was getting pretty loud  enough to wake me up in the morning   she gets up before me    got this one based on the reviews here and elsewhere   it looks good as far as blow dryers go i guess  i don t use them   it s actually fairly quiet  considering  br    br   i asked my wife about the  frizz  claim the other day  as i was skeptical about that part of the claim   and she said it really does work  she normally has a  frizz  problem    not sure if it s a placebo affect  but she s happy  so i m happy   she likes it better than her previous one  so that was already a plus  bought this to use on a recent trip to africa  worked perfectly and was the solution to managing my hair in the third world  i left it there with a young lady who couldn t afford to buy one for herself   two happy girls  great small hair dryer that i m able to keep in the camper for when we travel about  takes up nearly zero space   works quite well i purchased this dryer many years ago from a retail store   as stated   34 many years ago  34    easy to handle   great choices of temperatures and speed    it finally gave out   i tried a few other dryers    full sized and small  and none could  compared to this mighty dryer   returned the other and then purchased this through amazon   five stars              hair gets dry fast  i have long hair  below my shoulders but above waist   it takes me 35 40 minutes  i have fine textured hair    the temperature never feels too hot but it does the job  even at its highest level  and there is barely any sound coming out of this hair dryer   one can literally talk on the phone or what tv while under this dryer   one of the pieces  the hinged hood  broke during shipping  but the company responded quickly and promised to ship it   but i did not wait  i used super glue so that i could go ahead and start using it   it works just fine  i researched dryers extensively  bought the andis  retractable  etc   liked it br   for size  worked well  the switches weren t ideal  but    then after a year it stopped clicking br   into full position    i didn t fold   retract regularly   then a piece that fell out of br   the mechanism got into the motor  into the trash  not even worth salvaging  i bought the 18575w at goodwill for br    99   love it  better than the andis  unlike many other reviewers  i find the switch br   to be zero problem  actually prefer it  plus nothing is in the way of ones hand while drying  br   there you go  there s no telling   opinions are anecdotal  my mom travels a lot and this small size and ability to change electrical current for overseas a plus    no additional adaptor needed  1875 watts is quite powerful  all you need for on the go or at home is storage is an issue  after reading all the positive reviews on this hair dryer everywhere i decided to buy it   i love it  this hair dryer really is super quiet  this dryer runs so quiet you won t believe it  seriously   if your like me   can t stand the dryers that have that high pitched loud noise then this is the dryer for you  i also needed a dryer with a long cord  the 9ft cord on this one is perfect  i have long thick hair   this dries my hair pretty fast   gets nice   hot on the highest heat setting  it is also a little lighter than my old hair dryer which is nice  i love this hair dryer so much that i m buying a second one for my mom  i like this unit after reading product description  i ordered it  i have to travel to countries where we have 220volt power supply and i purchased a special voltage converter for hair dryers only  br    br   when i received it and read the safety guidlines in the note inside the package  i came to know i can not use this product with extension wires or with voltage converters  so this beautiful looking piece is no more good for me    this was a gift for my daughter for christmas  she couldn t wait to use it and she loves it  says its the best hair dryer out there  this dryer leaves all the shine and body in fine hair without sacrificing drying time  it s evident now that the previous expensive  super powerful  tourmaline dryer was blowing the body and shine out of the hairstyle  many bad hair days blamed on aging change of life that were actually caused by the too powerful dryer  br   with absolutely no changes to hair drying routine or styling products all hair drying sessions have produced good hair days  a most pleasant surprise to recapture more youthful hair  br   this dryer is much quieter than the previous one  the brushed finish and brown body pink accents feel good to the touch and pleasing to the eye  i had a previous version of this hair dryer that lasted several years  then shut off and sparked twice to die  this slid onto the attachment i had on my wall  so it was a seamless transition   it is very loud  hence the start deduction  but i have fine hair that dries quickly  so don t have to hear it for very long  does the job just fine  i purchased one for each person of my family and my sister has four bathrooms in her house   she was so impressed with it  she wanted to order three more  so i surprised her and got them for her   they are the best on the market      i would purchase again   we did put one in our 5th wheel bathroom also  i love the wall mount hair dryers   you always know where it is and it is never in the way  click and it is ready to use and click it is put away  i have fine thin hair and dont need much in the way of a dryer this one is perfect  love the attachments  dont even need a straightner when  i use this  this is a good hairdryer  and i particularly like the cold shot of air   it s very powerful    too powerful for my short curly hair  because it leaves it  frizzy   that s where the cold shot of air comes in handy   would be ideal for long hair  though   well worth the money   arrived early  but amazon always does a great job with delivery  the conair hairdryer arrived promptly and works perfectly   the price was acceptable and i was pleased to have my old non working appliance replaced so easily  i am in hair school and his dryer is perfect  works perfectly  the best dryer out there for sure  i love it  i love this blow dryer but after 6 months it stop blowing hot air  i did buy a new yellow bird but this time i got the warranty  this is the best hairdryer i ve ever owned   puts conair and revlon hairdryers to shame   time to look at other remington products   finding quality these days is rare   happy with my purchase  i really don t understand the good reviews  this dryer feels so cheap and flimsy  almost break the switch on first use  you have to see it to understand what i am talking about  don t buy it  my daughter was thrilled with this blow dryer  it is so compact  that it makes packing it a breeze  it is a little heavier than you would think it would be though  easy to use   it does everything that a hair dryer should  i would recommend it to anyone that needs one  make your hair soft  frizz free  my daughter has very thick fine hair  it does a wonderful job  highly recommend  i love this hair dryer   ergonimically balanced and dries hair fast  no high pitched whining noise like my old hair dryer  i ve used this for the last month now  and it is perfect  it does not get overheated  or bring the house down with noise when we use it  it is nice and handy  blows warm air in the right proportion  i love the multiple speed and heat options conair provided on this  br    br   i think this is the best product out there for around  10  i strongly recommend this purchase     i don t know how it does it  but it makes my hair look like a wig   like a beautiful  beautiful wig   it s smooth and shiny and requires no flat ironing  it s just perfect   totally crazy  br    br   buy it  i purchased this hair dryer as a christmas present and she loves it  the dryer warms instantly  looks great  the matte black    although the pink accent isn t my color   does a great job  and even has little rubber spots on the side  so that it doesn t slip  nice touch   it also has a removable filter that can be cleaned  for the price  i can t complain  i would definitely recommend this to others  as it does a great job at a reasonable price  the handle is too big for me also heavy but i like folding handle  retractable  code and affordable price  so i gotta  say it s ok   i ve had this hair dryer for about twelve years now and my sister always uses it when she s here  so i got her one for christmas   it has so much power for such a compact dryer   when mine dies  i m going to order another one   love it  love this dryer  have one in every bathroom and gifted one to my daughter  so easy and so reliable  has never let me down  blows cold and hot air  the paint eventually cracks after a couple months  but it s for blowing hair not looking nice  works great for me  excellant hair dryer that mounts on wall to save counter space  excellant hot air to dry hair quickly   nice nightlight that works automaticlly  my wife and i prefer these smaller hair dryers over the large bulky kind  this dryer puts out enough heat and air to handle our hair needs  its small size also makes it easy to pack for traveling  this is a great hair dryer and drys hair very quickly   the attachment is great for concentrating on one area as to not make hair frizzy   love this dryer  i wanted to dry my hair all over without having to hold the dryer   i wanted the old timey kind and this sort of fits the bill   the plastic casing is more fragile than the old ones but it gets the job done  this one dries so much more quickly than my previous hair dryer and seems to provide a smoother finish   recommended  i bought this for my mom for christmas  she had one similar to this for many many years and needed it replaced  to my surprise she told me she liked this one better than her old one  purchased this item for travel and it has proved to be a very good choice   would definitely recommend to others this is a great hair dryer  it has a nice weight to it and a nice smooth matte finish  i have very long hair and this hair dryer works faster than anything i ve ever owned  it s also surprisingly quiet to use  i m just sad i can t take it with me when i travel  this is the best   my daughters and i have different types of hair and different lengths  this dryer is so easy to hold  not too heavy or awkward and does an amazing job for each of us with the different settings and attachments  our only problem was we needed to use it at the same time   so we bought another one    great with great value it came with instructions for use and gave us real value for our money it is well recommended  this hair dryer works well  however  after about a year or so of use  the clear plastic coating around it  has started to peel off  this speaks to the quality of the materials used  it still works and i still use it but just wanted to mention that  it is pretty light  which is a good thing when you have a lot of hair to dry  the main reason i purchased this one was because it was more affordable than the salon brands  love this dryer  i ve been using wall mount hair dryers for years  actually only one before this one which was also a sunbeam  nothing lasts forever  loved the sunbeam before this one and this one is really good too  slender look  night light  two speeds  doesn t seem to get hot  looks nice on the wall  have only had this one for a month  but if it s anything like the old one it will last for years  twin switches for dual heat settings and dual speed settings   plus the blue   34 no heat  34  button   reasonably lightweight  comfortable grip  priced less than almost any other dryer you ll find at a store and yet works just as well  i think  br    br   be a good steward and get this one  i loved it  it does the job that i needed done i will not change to any other dryer as long as i can purchase this one  love it  keeps the frizz down and love the attachments  since i have some curl to my hair  it s nice to have the diffuser that fits the dryer  packaged nicely and delivered on time  i work in a beauty shop and it is wonderful it does everything i need it to do and more  got this for a trip to italy   it packed easily and took up minimal space   you still need the plug adapters for it but it worked great while on the trip  heats up fast  cools down quick  no waiting or anything  great product  it really worked on my wet curly hair i found it ideal as a travel hair dryer  it s small size fits into my shaving kit  but it also surprised me just how powerful it is  to dry and style wet hair  i used this dryer for the first time at a friend   house   it was amazing  it had the attachment on it and my hair was silky and dry within minutes   i was so thrilled with it  i went online and bought one   i still love it and the best part about the dryer is the warm setting   you can dry your hair right at your scalp and not burn your head or heat up the bathroom to the point where you re sweating    i highly recommend this dryer   i have had this dryer now for 6 months  this was on my daughters christmas list as a priority item  she is a hairdresser and swears that this blow drier cuts 20 minutes off her styling time  she was thrilled with this blow drier  having the power cord being able to retract is an awesome feature  no more messy cords to deal with  hence easy storage  this hairdryer works great and is at a great price point  i don t have any complaints on it  but will warn people that the cord is a little shorter than usual  has three setting on both the heat and on the blower and let me tell you  the highest settings are hot and powerful  this is a fantastic styling tool  comparable with my stylists dryer for sure  i highly recommend this dryer  and it s animal print    bonus  i purchased this unit for a family member and it is a great fit  the light weight and compact size is perfect for her at home use  she hasn t used it for travel  work like if i was in the salon  totally love it  my hair is a litte kinky and it leaves it nice and soft  i don t have much insight for the hair dryer s performance as it was a xmas gift for my wife but her feedback in a nutshell to me was   34 i love it    34    after exhaustive research on my part to find the best hair dryer at a given price point  i settled on the onei mk ii based purely on the amazon reviews and it apparently paid off    btw  she has very fine  blonde hair   i love this hair dryer  it has more settings than i am used to  i love the adapter pieces  i styled it with the styling tip and it looked like i got my hair done at the salon  super easy to install and very handy to preserve the valuable counter space  br   be sure to install away from water  its a great hairdryer  its much less noisy than some of the  others  it motivated me to go out and purchase another blow dryer to replace the cheap walmart brand that i had bought before  it seems to do a good job drying my hair even though  its hard to tell because i do not have very much hair excellent product  i like how much air and heat this hairdryer puts out  i have a ton of hair that takes ages to dry  but that time is much shorter with this hairdryer  br    br   the only downside is that i wish the cord was longer  my old hairdryer had a much longer cord and i was spoiled by it  this is my first time purchasing a hair dryer instead of a hand held one  i really like this product  dries hair fast and i can sit comfortably while waiting    the downfall is not being able to hear the television while hair is drying  however it gives me time to check out magazines or read a book while waiting  it is big  so i store it in my closet  luckily i have a walk in  i liked the hairdryer  i wish it was a little more powerful  but it did get the job done and was easy to use this product is just perfect for the teen i purchased it for   she s really in to primping and this saves time and is easy to use  love it   three speeds  noise  and two heat settings  my 4yr old no longer complains about blow dfying his hair cause of the queiter speeds  great buy for yhe price  one of our daughters had this item on her   34 wish list  34    she was excited when she opened it     very proud of her gift   appears to be of good quality and looks durable  i love this dryer  the cord system is super convenient easy to use for a reasonable price  get it  you wont regret it  nice dryer and so far it s working great   still not sure how long it ll last but i m hopeful that it ll still be working when my kids are sorting through my stuff and asking themselves    34 what the heck was he using this thing for   34  love the variety of settings  has a great long lead to move around as you dry your hair  can just about carry out a conversation as you use it  lightweight and fast drying  just what i wanted  excellent quality  good settings   i like the longer cord  no need for an extension cord  this was a definite christmas favorite   great color  works great  has the cool styling attachment which was a hit     my daughter loves it  mom will love this one  don t need to hold with hand and easy to carry around the country and abroad i bought this almost 3 years ago  and it s still going  i gave it 4 stars because i think it does get a little too hot on the highest setting  and not hot enough on the   34 warm  34  setting  however  if you are looking for a nice dryer on a budget  this is a great choice  i love the fact that the cord winds up  this little hair dryer is indeed mighty  it is small  lightweight  and easy to handle  perfect for travel or for someone who doesn t want to take up half their space with storing some of the big hair dryers  works very well as well  is really good  i like it so much  my hair is healthy and look natural  you need to try    i have used many many less expensive hair dryers over the course of 30  years and they often break within a year   i have had this dryer about two years now and it is still going strong  i m not a professional but have naturally wavy hair which is prone to frizz and fly away action   this hair dryer is amazing   it is heat controlled and not air controlled   instead of blowing my hair to dry it out  it gently blows heat at target area and dries hair faster  without wildness and frizz  my hair feels soft  is shiny and dries evenly   it was worth the money and the time to wait for it to arrive   but with prime you ll get it pretty quick  used on my 5 yr old with african american natural hair  does a super job especially when used in combination with a smoothing serum  when i use this dryer i m cool with delaying flat ironing  just ponytail her up  this is all i had hoped it would be  it has great power and it is the nice compact small size i desired  pleased with new blow dryer   dries hair  just as advertised   love the retractable cord   keeps my gym bag a little less messy   love the red  hot setting should be changed to almost warm  warm setting should be renamed cool  same for blower settings  by the time this generates heat and air your hair will already be dry  br    br   edit  after 60 days it has started making a grinding noise for about 15 20 seconds when first turned on  what next sparks  br    br   into the trash  good product but not great  air flow not so great and brush attachment too soft but worth the price nnn the matte finish was the first thing we noticed when we opened the hair dryer   it is great   looks good and has a great   soft texture   the temperature settings are low  med and high and it has a cool button for when you need a blast of cold air   the fan can be set to low and high   the fan moves lots of air  br    br   even an 80 s era  big hair band could save time with this product   that kind of hair needs to be washed  rinsed  washed again and then heavily conditioned   the conditioner softens the hair and forces it to accept massive amounts of water   this increased water volume must be removed prior to styling or the hair will just sit there flat   like a poorly tuned guitar   pull the conair 225np from the holster  point it at the hair and get started   the powerful dc fan moves lots of air to force its way into that mop head of hair and push the water out   the three heat settings provide complete control over the speed of the drying process   the entire band can share one 225np and still be on the stage in time to rock the house  br    br   medium heat and high speed fan gets hair dry fast with no friz  this dryer is every thing that it says it is  quiet  professional looking comfortable to use and attractive on the wall  it is certainly a quality item and i would recommend it to anyone this is my second portofino 6600   my daughter and i have thick  long  curly hair   this dryer cuts down the drying time by more than half   the first is still going strong after two years of daily heavy use   also very pleased  with the diffusser and concentrating attachments   this dryer has by far outperformed other well known brands costing two or more times the price   i would do commercials for this dryer  i have one of these already and love it  will make a great gift  it is powerful   the reel cord makes this blow dryer even better  i was trying to find a hair dryer that had 3 speed and 3 heat settings and was reasonable priced   this fit 3 requirements   it doesn t get quit as hot as i expected  but i am still pleased with it  i like the color and it s worked great   love all the heat and power settings   so far so good with this blowdryer the onei ii ionique hair dryer does a really good job drying my hair   the hair dryer is lightweight and powerful   my only question that was not in with instructions  when would i use the   34 negative ion  34  setting or the   34 regular ion  34  setting  extremely long cord which can be a pain but dryer is very good  light weight  reasonable price  i would recommend  got this for my wife  she really likes it  it is powerful  not too heavy  had great attachments for directing the air just where and how hot she wants it  her only complaint is the control is done with a slide on the handle  she has a problem with hand strength and she has to struggle a bit to move the slide  average person would probably not have an issue with this  my wife swears by this hair dryer and she is on her third unit  that may sound bad  but each one has lasted 5 years  so definitely seems okay for the price  br   lightweight  nice rubber grip  and not too loud  mom was desperate for a new dryer even though she doesnt use the old one she has now  br   but besides that this was a perfect upgrade  i got this dryer a couple years ago and use it quite frequently and it is still working great  i love the way the cord retracts and how the unit folds  it is great for travel but i use it as my main dryer at my boyfriend s house since it works so well  my hair is long and thick and this thing still gets the job done just as well as my full sized hair dryer that i keep at home  have only used in this country so far but it is small but does good job drying hair   it has optional conversion to foreign electrical systems   just your standard dryer for a pretty fair price and without running around in crowds hunting for model on sale  i always take my full size blow dryer even to nice hotels where i know they will have a blow dryer   i decided to try this dryer and it really works   it is so lightweight and i can t believe it can even dry my hair   i only take it with me now  i thought it would be smaller and more compact   much too big for travel   i was better of with a simple blow dryer  i ve had this dryer about a year  and it does dry hair  and the heat settings seem to be what they say they are  hot  warm and cool  also high and low power are accurate  unlike some other reviewers  i find that its drying power is fine    but i have fine hair that dries really fast anyway  however  the retractable cord function has never worked well  the button does not seem to depress all the way  and if it retracts all the way at all  not a guarantee most days   it s because i ve had to keep pushing and pulling to engage the retracting mechanism  which is half hearted at best  most times i just give up halfway and wind the cord around the unit because it s too big a bother  i have never experienced it retracting so fast that the cord whips around or anything  not anywhere near close to that problem for me  love this hair dryer   cool  medium  high settings great   but the key is that it is light weight   an ionic dryer without being my work out also   shiny hair in quick time   why did i wait so long to buy a product that works  i ve been using this dryer as my main hair dryer for the past four months and i love it  it is light weight and worked in both the us and the middle east  i also like that the dryer came with the two attachments  the handle also folds in to save space on packing   one thing i would point out to people looking at the reviews is that you will need a screw driver to change the voltage of the hair dryer  just something to keep in mind depending on your use of the hair dryer  but i would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone needing a dual voltage or travel hair dryer  i love the folding handle   retractable cord  compact   light  still strong enough for blow drying a long hair  i love love love this hair dryer  its fast and powerful  gets the job done within 10 minutes for me  good  light weight dryer  would be perfect if the attachment would stay in place  dryer needs a place where you can secure the attachments in place just great    and compacted   a lot of power br   doesn t over heat    great for the price and for first time users this a great dryer  dries hair fast  no frizz main reason i bought   yes i would recommend this to anyone  br   haven t found anything i dislike  not even one month  it was borken already  and i don t really use it that often  at first i liked it  because it s light weight and fast dry you hair  but it didn t last long  the best hair dryer  ever  always leaves my hair straight with lots of body  i ve had my first one for at least 7 years  i was trying to share it with my sister   her daughter  now  i m having my own daughter soon  so i gave my sister the first one   i bought another one  about ten years ago  hairdryers had air velocity that was more powerful  but now its about 20  less  br   is that because of the noise issue   they shouldn t do that  bring back the high air power  br    i just bought the andis 1600 regular size hair dryer   this product is so wonderful that i have bought in multiples for several years   i keep one in each bathroom and a spare in the linen closet for replacement use   very convenient  whenever i buy a house i always install one of these in the master bathroom   this is my 3rd one   very convenient  very strong  very hot  we used this in a commercial setting and so far it is working great   i like that is has the nightlight built in  love this item   easy to install   very easy to use   its always handy and easy to get too  heat and air is perfect as far i am concerned   would highly recommend  lightweight  inexpensive  and good for home use  got it quick  was just as described but a little on the noisy side  i used this hair dryer while traveling this summer  it was used in the us  canada and italy  i was very happy with it  it folds up so it is compact and easy to pack but it is still very powerful for such a little hair dryer  i also appreciate the two attachments that come with it  and  the fact that you can switch it between 120v and 220v makes it incredibly convenient  this was a great purchase for me   dryer has great power and drying ability  very efficient   i would highly recommend   the item was exactly as described  i was finally ready to replace my 8 year old travel hairdryer  with something more powerful and quite  and yet just as light weight  i have fine shoulder length hair with a tendency towards frizz   i stumbled across the positive reviews for the onei mkii while researching several other hairdryers  t3 featherweight  elchim 2001 and bablyiss 2800   i chose the onei based upon the great reviews  the 4 year warranty  and the price  i think this hairdryer is great  it is very quite  dries my hair in half the time  and feels like it will last  my hair feels great   not scorched like with my old dryer  if you are looking for a top performing dryer  i would highly recommend trying this dryer first  the cool setting actually gets very cold  which is also  a great bonus for locking in curl and reducing frizz  great dryer   nice heating controls  average weight   i have had it for a few months and have been very happy with it  this is a great little hair dryer   i like that it has three heat settings which are useful when wanting my hair to be straighter or have more curl   i was hesitant about the retractable cord  but it works great and i have not had any issues with this dryer at all  good purchase  this is by far the best hair dryer i have purchased   i have thick long hair  past my waist  and it dries my hair quickly  lots of airflow   for the amount of power i feel it has its a plus that its much smaller then the dryers i ve had   i wouldn t say it was quiet but its not very loud   it kinda hums instead of the high pitch whistling others have  and im in love with beautiful color and texture   i bought another as a xmas gift for my mother in law i know she will love it    the 4 yr warranty is a very nice bonus  love this dryer  compared it with the sedu 4000 and ended up returning the sedu because it was much heavier and louder   this dryer is quiet  light  and i don t have to straighten my hair after  my hair is thick  wavy and frizzy  it also cut down my drying time about 5 minutes   so glad i found it on amazon after a very extensive search  and it was half the price of the sedu  this item came fast and as of this writing  she hasn t opened the gift   looking forward to seeing her eyes on this item   thanks again  my only objection is how large it is   why can t they make a travel sized dryer with a brush attachment  i love the adjustable heat  i love the attachments and works and lasts for years  it was everything i could want in a hairdryer this hair dryer is everything   i absolutely love it   i am african american and have very kinky hair  this dryer gets my hair straight and then i only have to run through my hair with the flat iron one time  i also use it for my daughter  she has loose curly hair and it gets her hair silky straight  love love love this dryer  i m a professional stylist  this dryer is powerful  it works great for any type of hair  the 2 nozzles give me options to how to distribute the air flow according to the density of the hair  i really like it  great for professionals and personal use too  you can t go wrong with twin turbo  they are great dryers  thank you  have owned a few hair dryers and this one has definitely been my favorite   provides adequate fan power and heat while the overall design seems solid   the cool setting provides a nice little gush of cooler air and the folding ability has been pretty handy  albeit mainly handy for going on trips    the attachments it comes with also work pretty nicely and fit pretty snug   have had this for more than a year now with no problems as everything is still operating perfectly   would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a solid and well priced hair dryer  i am happy with the fact that my hair does feel healthier but dry time which was supposed to be cut in half was not so  for the cost of the dryer i would have like directions to running the dryer  i have no idea what the difference is between negative ions or neutral ions  this would be helpful since its all about the ions  overall i feel like it is a good dryer just wish it had done all it was supposed to do for the price  this dryer is professional quality and  it does work very well if you have the muscles to operate   it is too heavy to travel with  i absolutely love this dryer  it gets really hot on the highest setting which i prefer using because it will dry my hair faster  i like that it is adjustable and you can get a chair and slide it right over  overall  it did the job of drying my hair and i m satisfied  yes  i like it  i just wish it was even hotter but it is hot enough  i like the nightlight too  mounting can be easy depending     bought one for our winter home also because its a great space saver and its extremely convenient to have it right at your fingertips   very powerful for a little dryer  i m honestly not one to write reviews but do rely heavily on them and this item was rated very high by amazon customers who purchased it   i have to admit  i really  really liked it until it just simply stopped working   it is lightweight and powerful and fairly quiet for a blow dryer   i was real happy with it until it just recently stopped working   conveniently right outside the 1 year limited warranty   i didn t misuse or drop it and i kept the filter clean so not sure what happened but i know my last blow dryer lasted for years   it was working when i gave it away when i got this one   so  not so thrilled but maybe it was a fluke   who knows  love this hair dryer  2nd i ve owned  first one i got on qvc  amazon was cheaper to go for this one   t3 is worth it for hair dryer  i know they r much more expensive  but worth the price  drying time is less  cuts down on frizz  br   i ll never go back to store brand   i have been using this model for the last 10 years  it only been replaced for once   it is beautiful  space save  powerful and very durable plus it has a night light  can t get a much better hair dryer for this price  have had no problems with it  my wife loves it and uses it all the time  i liked this hair dryer while it worked  it was light and didn t tire my arm or wrist  it got hot enough to dry my hair  and it wasn t extremely loud like a lot of dryers are  however  after a month and a half of using it once every day for about 15 mins  it stopped blowing hot air  it still blew air and everything perfectly  it just stopped heating the air  so  i had to get rid of it because cold air does not work well to dry my long hair  i think it might have just been a lemon  because i know sometimes there s just going to be defective items in a group  amazon customer service was quick to help me though  and i was able to get a refund  i love my hanging hair dryer  i never have to drag it out of a drawer and put it back it is always there it has a night  light but i usually unplug it unless i have company the light comes in very handy then it has plenty of air for blowing my long hair and i also like the way i can hang the cord up the hand controls seem very flimsy and there are only two heat setting and when i set it at hot  it give me warm air at most   i d return it but i aready threw the box away  no more tangled cord  love this dryer  it is also pretty quiet for it s high wattage  i recommend this dryer  after 15 minutes of constant operation the connection betwee  the two parts started melting  other than that everything else is pretty satisfying  i like the folding handle but don t feel like the dryer gets hot enough to dry my hair very fast  works like a charm  i love it  it does a great job for the money that i spent on it  i used this product at a marriott hotel and loved it  it has multiple settings  a directed air flow and seems to add volume to my hair  the retractable cord and folding handle are great for storage and travel  i would highly recommend this product to everyone  i like the fact this dryer is light which is great however it is very loud and i have to use earplugs because of the noise level   it does a great job drying and styling hair   i have used this dryer in hotels before but never have i experienced a dryer that is this loud  great deal for the price   only drawback is lack of height adjustment   this requires only that either the platform it s resting on and or the seating of the user be adjusted instead   excellent winter head warmer and brain circulation stimulator worth upwards of 15 iq points  it was really loud  unnecessarily powerful for drying hair  my daughter was petrified of it and then it suddenly glowed red and started smoking  the dryer is nicely  compact when it s folded  i like the retractable cord  which makes it even easier to store or travel with  my only complaint is that there s only one switch for   34 low  medium  high  34   i would prefer if it had separate temperature and speed controls  i went with this rather than another compact dryer with those controls because of the good reviews  i can say that this is really well built  love this hairdryer it is one of the best hairdryers i have ever used in my life   i ordered this for a friend who had one already but i should have kept it for myself as a back up incase my ever died but i had it for about 3 years now and nothing went wrong yet  i love this blowdryer  it is light weight and portable  i love how it folds up for when i travel  it is also super powerful and i can dry my long hair in just 5   10 min  great traveling hair dryer   i used this when i went to florida last month and it was so nice how it folds and the retractable cord was great instead of wining it around the handle  my wife bought this  but i ll leave my two cents  this is a very quiet hair dryer  i figured that was something interesting that you should know  the air blows smooth and has a cool air button  the weight is about average and comes with two end pieces that i have no idea what they are for  its a very nice hair dryer  the quiet factor with our sleeping baby is something i didn t expect  it was just what i wanted and worked great for a few months  then one of the fan blades broke off for no apparent reason just after the warranty expired  no way to fix it  so it went into the garbage  excellent  can t believe how smooth my hair is since using this dryer  dries my hair in half the time  love it  several months later  it is working great   i m not sure about   34 ionic conditioning  34  but it doesn t cause the split ends my old conair did so something positive is happening it s little  and it s powerful  what more do you want from something called   34 mighty mini  34   br    br   for all the reviewers that complain about the size and how   34 cheap  34  if feels  realize that you are buying something made for travel  and that it cost a whopping  20  br    br   this is a great hair dryer and suits my needs perfectly  br    br   if you want a bigger  more expensive one  then go find one elsewhere  i ve only had this for about a week but i m pretty impressed so far   i had my old hairdryer for at least 6 years and it finally crapped out on me   it was just a revlon that i had gotten from walmart or somewhere   i considered spending about  30 more on a nicer dryer  but decided i d try a conair first since it was cheaper and my mom has one that i love using when i go home   so i ordered this guy  which came in two days   gotta love amazon prime when you don t have a working hair dryer  and was initially kind of bummed when i opened it   i know you get what you pay for  but this one is much lighter than the dryer my mom has  so i was worried it wouldn t work as well   turns out my fears were unfounded   this guy is powerful and quieter than my old dryer  and the tourmaline ceramic technology  which they tout as leaving your hair shinier with less frizz  totally works   my hair has been amazing every day   i also really like how light it is now that i know it works   i don t know how long this guy will last and i can see the matte casing eventually peeling off like the other reviewer mentioned  but it s functionality is fantastic for the price   would definitely recommend this  i like that i can get great results on the medium setting  found that i only use the hot setting when i am in a rush  but be careful because it s gets really hot  used it at a hotel and had to have one  this is the best hair dryer i have ever used  dries fast cuts drying time in half  and doesn t make my hair frizzy  highly recommend it   this was the first product i buy on amazon  the thing is heavy but it works amazing   is big but i won t change it for nothing   the prize it s awesome comparing with what you can do with this thing  best thing it won t damage ur hair   don t be fooled by its tiny size   it is so powerful  it dries my hair as fast and my big one  it s cute  convenient and efficient  i love it  its just what i needed  its a simple blow dryer but it works just fine for being so cheap  i like how its effective in the mornings after a long shower  i have thick  curly hair that i blow out every few days  this blow dryer has cut my drying time in half  the air force is strong with this one  put it down on the bathroom counter and watch your hair ties and whatnot go flying  but it gets the job done  and incredibly well  my hair is  less  dry from this dryer  despite the high heat  and looks very healthy and sleek when blown out  br    br   worth it  purchased in december 2011  worked great up until november 2013  it behaves as if there is a short  i suspect it involves the retractable cord  i ll shy away from another retractable cord product  all the product i purchased from blue novelties thru amazon were christmas gifts for my girls  they were delighted and thrilled at the way the products worked  i ll be saving a lot of beauty salon cost from now on  i love shopping at amazon com and i have found a friend in blue novelties  please email me a catalog so i can give it to them  problem now is    they fight over the products  br      i can t win  no matter how much i try   thanx   mr  mac this blowdryer is a great product   it is lightweight and dries your hair fast   it is a super product for the price  very loud   i bought this to give to my wife to replace her old hair dryer   this one is so noisy it sounds like she is drying her hair with a jet engine  i ve had this hair dryer for at least 4 years  and although i did not purchase it from amazon i am still reviewing the product itself   my dryer is still going strong like the day i took it out of the box   a few notes of caution   1  keep the lint filter on the backside cleaned off or the air flow will be cut down   using an old toothbrush can help clean this off  2  do not use the hottest setting   as others have stated  it will fry your hair   i had this problem several years ago and didn t realize my hair had fried because of the setting on the dryer  until my stylist looked at my dryer   i use it on the medium setting and it works great  seems to be working great  my 86 year old mom can t get to the salon much any more so this works for her hair needs  great hairdryer  works perfectly fine  it dries my hair in less than 5 minutes  my hais short but a bit thick  small  powerful easy to take on trips    occupies very little space  light weight  works in europe with no hassle easy to pack attractive design very strong wind produced by this hairdryer   dries my hair very fast  the cool setting defrizzes my hair after the wind tunnel dry    i have long thick hair and i can dry it in about 6 7 mins   great product ordered as a replacement after my old one  same hairdryer  died  this is a great hair dryer   it s cooler than most  which is what gives hair its shine and control  works very well  works great  compact  portable  powerful  so far so good  would purchase again  purchased to replace an older model of same brand  installed in guest room bath  and it s a nice extra that is convenient and out of the way   especially liked that the cord is not dangling  this is a small powerful hair dryer  it fulfills our needs very well and it has a cute color  our 5 year old daughter can use it being so lite  i use this every day and they are the best hair dryer wall mount you are ever going to buy  quality dryer that blows hot and hard enough to dry you hair very quickly and hang it back up and you are off and running  anyone can mount it to the wall near an outlet and a mirror  i am on my 3 one over many many years and will not buy any other dryer when you can have this one to keep your life fast and simple and still looks good mounted on you wall  i love this blow dryer because it get the job done for less the price  i do a lot of natural hair and it smooth out that cuticle allowing me to flatiron the hair smooth and straight this it s the second one i bought   one for home and one for word  love it  great high quality hair dryer that works extremely well  comes with a diffuser and all so it is great for even long  thick curly hair  dries it quickly and overall it even looks like a very nice product as the handle material is very smooth with a good grip  great value for purchase  would highly recommend  i have a small bathroom  so putting the hair dryer on the wall is a great solution  it is at my fingertips  works well  perfect for travel  compact  light weight  as good as any full size dryer  pretty sturdy also  i d recommend it  heats up really quickly  not sure if the ionic thing actually works or not  but it dries my hair fast  br    br   and as a guy  the black and gold design is nice  not as embarassing as having a bright pink hair dryer  awesome product   just what i wanted   i have medium length  thick  curly hair that takes forever to dry  and was looking for a small blow dryer with a diffuser   i wanted the blow dryer to double for daily use and travel  so my items can be useful in all ways and save space since i live in a small home   when i first received the product and removed it from the box  i was skeptical about its ability to dry hair   it looks like a toy   however  it has two speeds which are comparable to other blow dryers   it works great   i use it every day   i love the bag which is stylish and easily holds all the accessories plus the dryer without problems   finally someone who makes a storage bag where the product actually fits once the consumer uses it   unlike tents that you can never stuff back into the bag once you unpack them   i loved this product so much i bought one for a gift  i love that this dryer is compact and really blows the air at your hair   i found this in a hotel and liked it so i looked it up and bought it from amazon   love the price  too   i have a  150 dryer  which i really like  but it just doesn t blow the hair as strongly as i would like sometimes  john frieda products are always good  i use the shampoo  what is good  not more to say  just another hairdryer  bought for a trip to europe  worked great with an adapter  no troubles  small and easy to fit into luggage  great hair dryer    lose the night light  it s quiet and easy to install   if you keep the light make it any color  except for green   i thought et was sleeping in the bathroom  when it works its okay  but the hood has a habit of collapsing when it gets too hot  the part that holds up the hood does not keep the hood up  quality hair dryer  works perfectly  you do need to be careful to thread the cord through the bottom to get a tight fit against the wall  runs and runs and runs forever  really  on and off switch broke after one week of using it high heat was not that hot when using it smelled as if something was burning would not recommend to buy  this is everything i need in a hair dryer  i have medium textured wavy hair  and the diffuser really helps make the most of my curls and waves  they turn out with great volume and shine  my husband says my hair is   34 fluffy  but in a good way  34    and less frizz than i get with letting my hair air dry  overall  the product does its job and i am very pleased  i love having my hair dryer out of the way and on the wall   reviews said the night light went out in 2 weeks  but i have had mine for a few weeks and the night light is still going strong   the only issue i have with this hairdryer is that it doesn t have a cool air setting  i took the hair dryer to asia and while there  i put it on the 220 volt setting and plugged it in   it worked good on the low fan speed  but  when i put it on high  the hair dryer smoked and immediately burnt up   i had tested it in the usa on the 110 setting and it seemed to work fine   this unit in my mind will not work in asia without burning up   it was either defective or not engineered to work on 220 volts   my friend really needs a hair dryer in the morning and was not a happy camper when it burnt up   i this hair dryer works well but it is larger and heavier than i expected and my hair seems to get caught in it a bit  i would have liked it better were it much lighter weight and smaller  i got this for my girlfriend  it works fine so far for the price  it s a bit bulky  i wish it folded up   but those don t seem to be as good without spending a lot more money  great hair dryer   i have short hair and can dry my hair in about 90 seconds   it also is small enough to not take up too much room on the bathroom counter  and is light and fits well in my hand  blows hard and hot if needed  had to disconnect night light  so bright  could be used as a street light  also  loud enough to be used on a train  will wake everyone in the house with the door closed  had a different brand for five years before  that was perfect  should have re ordered the same  makes blow drying so easy  i have very thick hair and the combs are sturdy  easy to handle and does not get too hot  i got this for the wife  when i asked her after several months of usage she said it s great and work like a lot of high end blue dryer  br    br   for the price this is an awesome product  heavy duty dryer   great construction   only problem    the on off switches are a little hard to move with wet fingers   but overall   still good product  i needed a 2nd dryer to leave at a 2nd residence   i liked the first one i bought 2 or 3 years ago and it still works fine  using it 7 days a week   this is fairly compact  the handle folds up  the retractor works well but i always guide the cord back into the handle when i retract it  if you let it zip closed i believe it places more wear on the rewinding mechanism    it does get fairly hot  has a cooler setting  plus shot of cold air  not too loud  and comfortable to grip and use   it would be nice if it had a 240 volt built in converter but the cost was slightly under twenty bucks and many foreign hotels in the west have built in converters in their hotel rooms   i was very pleased with the first one  still up and running fine  and the new one is as good as the old one   my wife also likes it as she has very thick hair which takes a long time to dry   she says for an inexpensive hair dryer this does better than most and drys her hair in a reasonable manner   a number of hotels like marriott buy this andis  and others that look almost identical  to place in their rooms   one manager stated that he usually keeps several on hand as customers frequently ask to buy one i had this blow dryer it was awesome   it leaves your hair amazing when using it on the last power   i need to re buy this blow dryer   i have really thick coarse hair with bangs this blow dryer made my hair super straight feels like right out of the salon   great product   wasn t sure if i could find one of these type hair dryers again   it was requested by one of our senior residents that live in the residential facility i work at  good hairdryer   cheap  not too big  not too loud and lightweight  dries my hair quickly and it is powerful this is by far the best hair dryer you ll ever own  i have wavy  thick  not complaining   out of control hair that is usually best left to dry on its own  but this dryer straightens it without use of any additional hair products  i am impressed  this is great product   i brought one for my sisters and mother   they really love it   i also put on in our rv coach   i would recommend to everyone  this is one efficient dryer  and it seems to do a great job in reducing frizz in my curly hair  i use it with the diffuser  haven t attempted a straight styling with it yet  and i get great results even on the high hot setting  love the the cord retracts for easy storage  too  wrapping a cord around the handle every time gets old pretty fast when you re using a dryer every day  my plans were to replace my travel hairdrier with this one but this one was bigger than mine   the advantage i found is the noise  this hairdrier is not as loud as many other but to me the size was more important   would not work for me   if size is not an issue this is a good purchase  gave this as a gift   she loved it    it made her drying time half of what it was   she has long thick hair  thanks  i just got mine today and to test it i decided to do my sister s hair   so when i open the box let me tell you i didnt expect it to be so small   however   according to the description it was said to have more power   i told my self i ll be the judge of that been that i had the twin turbo 3200  so i said this one should deff do better   so i did her hair   finished it very quickly actually  and i can say the hair was very shinny  the size did not have anything to do  with the power this blow dryer provided    so i am pleased with the results the hair was very soft and like glowy which never happened with the other dryer   so strong and dries well  love it  i have been using it for ever since but had no problems     this little dryer is amazing   not only is it great for trips but for people with little strength in hands and shoulders   my cousin just loves it  infinity by conair mighty mini blow dryer is awesome  it s so small and lightweight i forget i m holding a blow dryer  br   don t be fooled by the small appearence  you ll definitely get much bang for your buck with this one  i have long curly tresses and it drys my hair lickidy split  br   would absolutely recommend to a friend  and to a complete stranger too   a great replacement for a dryer i had for years  it is  in fact  better than the one i had  a pleasure to use  i like this hair dryer   much lighter than my old one and dries hair great   i like that the concentrator is included   the intake screen in the back is removable  so i can clear out the dust that collects  does what it s supposed to  haven t had any problems with it yet  but the sliding switches seem really cheap  better quality switches would have pushed it to 5 stars  shame they cut corners on the only moving piece that you actually have to manipulate to use the thing  reminding me how cheap it feels when i use it every time  i absolutely love this blowdryer  it makes my hair so shiny and nice  it also blowdries it in less than 10 minutes  and i have pretty long hair  i have already had 3 friends test this out and buy it  when my old hair dryer died on black friday  i knew there was no way i was going to target to buy a new one that day   so  i hopped on amazon  found a well rated  inexpensive model and then paid almost the purchase price to have it shipped to me on saturday   totally worth it   this works as well as any hair dryer i ve had   i noticed that it doesn t have a   34 cool  34  setting  although it does have a   34 cool  34  button    i ve never used that setting  but if you need a hair dryer with a cool setting  this one won t work for you  very powerful  need a red dryer for the wife  this one is very light so it s not very tiring for the wrist  excellent in every way  was originally concerned about replacing a professional hair dryer with this one and couldn t be happier  i have been using this dryer for about 8 months now  i am quite happy with my purchase  as far as dual voltage dryers go  this is one of the better ones  however  when used at 220v i find that drying time is greater  it leaves my hair quite soft and relatively frizz free even without a product  i have very thick   wavy hair with a lot of volume  love this hair dryer   perfect price   works great   i would recommend this to anyone with no hesitation   i use both attachments  and both work great  i bought this because i loved the idea of having a retractable cord  the cord works as well as i had hoped  and the unit has an added blessing as well  the housing doesn t seem to get very hot  so i don t have to wait for it to cool before putting it away  i love this hair dryer   i have medium long but thick hair  and my hair dries in literally 1 3 to 1 2 the time of my old hair dryer   comes with the two separate attachments  directional and diffuser  and then both work great and attach firmly but easily   great product  works perfectly if you follow the directions for use  folds nicely and doesn t take up a lot of space glad to have it with me on my european travels  needed a dryer lite and easy to use for when we travel and this did the trick   not for everyday but very handy for travel and a back up dryer great dryer  gets the job done   it is a bit heavy but manageable   i ve had it for quite awhile now   can t remember how long   and no diminishment in power or performance  i picked this up to use on heatshrink wrap  it didn t work as i expected  but it does work well on drying hair   the build quality is questionable at best  i feel like this should be a bit heavier  but its really light and i feel like i could break it if i held it any tighter  this was great when it worked  i have a small bathroom and it was the perfect solution until it stopped working shortly after purchase  i should have returned it  i do not recommend this unit  it s powerful  not too loud  and not as heavy as people seem to say in other reviews   very efficient and does a great job  i really like this dry   i works wonderfully  but sometime i tend to change the settings unintentionally due to the location of the switches   it s a great dryer other than that  this dryer cut my drying time down from 15 minutes to under 3 minutes  i have medium length hair   great price  love it  i had to replace my 8 year old turbo power and didn t even consider purchasing a different brand  it dries and straightens my very curly hairy in no time with salon quality  i use this to straighten my hair  i love that it is portable  and i can pretty much sit anywhere to dry my hair  which takes about an hour to do  it will overheat if you do not make sure the air vent is not blocked by anything  i have had this for years and use it weekly  i definitely will buy it again if i it ever breaks  we had been using a windmere hair dryer  which my husband owned prior to our marriage twelve years ago  that finally bit the dust   my husband was looking for a hair dryer with side vents vs the rear vent   we purchased this sporty  red model   and  so far  have been pleased with its performance   features a low high speed cool setting which is slightly warm  and a low high speed high heat setting   which i have rarely used   the cool setting is enough for us   the only improvement we would suggest is in the way the switches are set up  dries my medium length hair quickly   i would recommend this product to others  does exactly what i need to do  perfect  it has a nice texture and nice shape  not too heavy or too light  my wife loves this dryer   it is very reliable and has a lot of heating for such a small size   fits in your suitcase and does not take up a lot of room like the professional dryers  i have both this model and the 1600 watt hair dryer   they are the same size but the difference is very noticeable   go with the 1600 one  the external head of hair dryer consistently comes out and does not stick in the place  the heat and cold are good  but overall it s not made from the best quality materials  i wont recommend it to any one so nice to have it hanging on the wall ready to use     only drawback  the green night light is very bright so we don t leave it plugged in love this dryer  works so great and fast too  bought it for my mom as a gift and she absolutely loves it  she has very thick hair and hair dryer worked great for her  i have searched high and low for the perfect hair dryer and i am so happy to say that i have finally found it  having crazy curly hair i am no stranger to losing the battle against frizz when trying to straighten my hair  i was amazed at how fast i could blow dry my hair and i barely had to use any product to tame my lions mane  not only that  but i barely had to use my straightener to finish the job  it s an amazing styling tool  and if i had to buy one again i wouldn t hesitate buying another onei mk ii air ionique  and to boot it s a fabulous christmas present   this does the job for my gym bag  it has the basic  low  high and cool shot settings and best of all  it folds and is compact for travel  i love the power of this blowdryer  it is the only one that works for me  i have tried others and there is a big difference  i am glad that i was able to find this one  they are not easy to find   thank you for having it  i thought i had found the exact item i needed to fix my 87 year old mother in law s hair at home since she can t get out to go to the salon   well      there is a major flaw with this hair dryer   the hose will not stay connected to the bonnet   if she holds her head perfectly still  we can get through the drying but that just isn t possible for someone who has to change positions once in a while   i would not purchase this item again   wish i had the paperwork where i could return it  i like the nozzle attachment  but it can fall off easily which can get annoying   it has 2 levels of heat settings and 2 levels of cool blow dry settings so that is good  and it is not heavy   but i recently used a friend s conair infinity hairdryer and i actually liked that much better  it dried my hair in less time and it was less frizzy     perfect for use in our motor home  hooked on the wall next to the sink  don t have to dig for it under the sink  happy happy happy   great air dryer  as per my wife    this thing can blow some air   great product and feels good  this item is very great for its price  i would recommend others to buy it if they re looking for a hair dryer for less money  it also came in time  maybe in 5 days  normally  3 5 days delivery is great for me  i am a 60 something female and as you can imagine have owned my share of hairdryers over the years but i have to tell you that this is the best and a real bargain at the price   i am ordering more for gifts   it is very lightweight and the fastest dryer i have ever owned  my only regret is that i did not find this one years ago   you will not be disappointed with this one  it was easy to mount and it works well  it needs a   34 cool only  34  setting to make it five stars handy powerful little blower that i keep around strictly for any guests that might be staying the night   perfect that it folds as it maybe gets used once a month   no problem with the retractable cord yet but i could see that easily getting jammed at some point not a lot of power but perfect in every other way   attachments are excellent  and the cord is right length  i ve been using this dryer 3 4 times a week for about 3 months now   the infiniti is quieter  smaller  about 6  34  high and 5    34  long  and lighter in weight than my old dryer  all reasons why i picked the infiniti   this dryer is so light weight that it feels cheap  but so far seems to be working like a champ  br     this is my first tourmaline ceramic dryer  and it does seem to leave my hair smoother  but not enough that i d be willing to toss my flat iron   i have thinner hair  about mid length between chin and shoulder  and i am able to dry it pretty quickly with the infiniti  br     i m a satisfied customer    i am so impressed with this hair dryer it s straightened my hair and i don t have to do too much to it it has the speed and the heat that is needed to have a glossy shiny look for my hair i am a cancer patient and this is new hair so it makes it look very sexy and i really like the product  i wanted a blow dryer with a lot of power  but without a lot of noise   this styler delivers on both counts   there are two heat settings   the warm setting is not much higher than room temperature  and the hot setting is very warm   there are also two power settings   low is just enough to dry without tangling  and high is perfect for pulling hair straight on a round brush   the styler is not overly loud  and more importantly  it is without that annoying whine you get with some blow dryers   i have no idea if the   34 ionic  34  part of it has any merit  as i haven t noticed that it dries my hair any faster or with less damage   i have lots and lots of fine textured  moderately curly hair  and this styler does a great job  perfect for vanity top storage  i hated the previous mess of a hair dryer cord all over my br countertop  only problem was  the distal opening of this hair dryer was bigger than my old hair dryer holder  so  i got creative and purchased a solid marble drinking cup at bed  bath    beyond  problem solved  the solid marble cup is heavy enough to hold down the dryer  it fit perfectly into the interior of the cup  and eliminated the counter top clutter of a power cord  broke after 6 months  one day it just stopped blowing hot air  cold air works fine  it was great while it lasted  very good hair dryer  slightly heavier than a dc motor  but we knew that going in  works great thus far and hopefully will last a lot longer than other dryers  looked for a long time for a hair dryer that has a low medium and high heat setting and a low medium and high blower button  this is a great hair dryer dried my hair fast  this dryer is not as powerful as most but that is a good thing  leaves my hair soft and shiny  not dried out or frizzy  excellent buy   this was for my sister and he is in love with it  the product arrived on time and in perfect conditions  this hair dryer really packs a punch   i had used this exact model at a hotel in dallas and then again in pensacola and i had to buy it   i ve had it for a few months and it does its job and doesn t get too hot   it blows a lot of air and dries in a very efficient time   i have long  thick  wavy hair and it usually takes me about 15 minutes to dry   with this dryer i m down to 8 and mid way through i switch to warm  br    br   excellent dryer for this price  great dryer and a great price   quiet and gets the job done  i had a conair that was 6 years old that i used every day and it finally bit the dust  with that kind of reputation it was easy to know what brand to pick  this is kind of bulky but as long as your not traveling with it it s ok  not a lot of velocity but it gets your hair dry in a decent amount of time works  great for curling my hair with the diffuser  other blow dryers make my hair frizzy  but this one does not  was looking for something exactly like this  i have thick  medium length hair and this is perfect to completely dry damp  towel dried hair  creates less frizz than a standard hair blow dryer and i believe it is faster to dry your hair with this  i originally bought two different japanese model hair dryers and returned the lower wattage one to keep this one  just the right strength  it does get hot so keep a continuous  slow pace as you move this throughout your hair and you ll be just fine  highly recommend  i have had it for about 2 3 months and its just perfect    i love the color love the way it works and i am so happy that it has the different heat and strength levels  it dries my hair so fast and it stays flat most of the times even when it s humid outside  this dryer gets very hot  very fast and makes drying my hair take less time  my hair felt softer as well  great dryer  not as powerful as others led me to believe  however  it is cute and very easy to travel with  it will be a staple in my suitcase from now on  i bought this to replace a very compact size that burned out  i mistakenly thought the larger size would mean this new one would be more powerful  but it was not  it does seem to work fine though and i probably shouldn t deduct a star for my misgivings  but i don t love it  it s not exactly lightweight  but it s also not a compact dryer  i find the weight to be average  however  i find the warm setting to be very similar to cool when the dryer is on high  on the lower speed  it is warm  and  hot is a bit too hot  excellent product we got as a gift  she loves it  it was just what she wanted  it works really well  absolutely love it  it drys very well  its super hoot  so if you are not use to using heat protection products id recommend you do  just to avoid burning your ends  its size is perfect for travel  it fit so well in a small spot  and is very durable  id recommend   this blow dry is awesome    it dries my hair so quickly  i have used blowdryers  but this one beats them by a long shot  i like that it is heavy duty and built to last  looking forward to having this for a long time  the hair  dryer which i purchased from amazon was just what i needed   we were able to install it in the same place as the previous dryer   both were from sunbeam or oster  great size and powerful air   the tools that come with it are very useful and for me don t have a problem staying on  this is a great  great blow dryer  it straightens my hair better than any other blow dryer i ve owned  i love it  i love it  it is neat and out of the way yet always available  the green light is bright but it makes a great night light  it is quiet and has great power  i took it to costa rica with my  easy to travel with  great and quick dryer  it managed to dry my hair in high humidity  this dryer is perfect for a first timer s dryer  it does not make your hair frizzy and the temperature i just right  it works well and the cord has just about the right length  its light and easy to use in small hands and the additional fixtures are great for styling  you don t want a dryer that drys your hair completely some moisture must remain or it will be frizzy  my biggest disappointment was when i couldn t attach the end cap so that i could concentrate more on the strands of my hair  it s like the hot heat deformed the plastic attachment to where it wouldn t click to the dryer  it became so frustrating  but for the diffuser  it remains to work just fine    only because i hardly ever use it  i bought this  dryer years ago which is a plus  but i have had issues with it burning some parts my hair  the ion button switches off on its own   i don t regret buying it  but it s not as great as i d like it to be  i gave it a 3 stars  works great   our camper has a small bathroom  i needed a hairdryer that was always up and out of the way   this one is perfect  works fine   replaced a similar older model with this one   it seems to be a bit lighter than the older one   good purchase  i was hoping for a powerful travel dryer  like the rest of t3 dryers  i had to return it  not powerful enough for me  you can get much cheaper travel size dryers that will do the same job  it is a very good dryer  my girlfriend loved it  arrived safely in its box with all parts  i highly recommend it  magic  pure magic  attachments are hard to get off  but i don t want them falling on my feet when i m drying my hair either  heat settings in addition to fan speed adjustment are awesome  cute color and feels great in my hand  dries my thick mane super quickly  i bought this dryer because i was taking a trip to ireland  and needed a hair dryer that could switch voltage  before we left the us  i changed the switch to be compatible with uk power  followed the instructions and kept it on the low setting  which is just as powerful as the high setting on us voltage   plugged it into the plug adapter  you need this to be able to plug any us appliances into wall outlets in most other countries   plugged that into the wall outlet  and it worked perfectly   i was originally going to use this dryer only when travelling  but it works so well that i use it every day now   love it  great hair dryer   and the price was great too   it s sturdy   it is a little hard to get used to with the controls being on the inside of the handle  but once you do it s super   i use it on my dog after his shampoo and he likes it too        would recommend  i have had this hair dryer for a year now and i love how quickly it dries my hair   it also gives my fine hair more volume   when i travel and use a hotel hair dryer  i can really tell the difference and miss my hair dryer   it has a 5 foot cord and several drying options   my only minor negative is where the buttons are located  i sometimes hit them when i grab the hair dryer  this is a great dryer  the handle folds down for easy compact storage   i also like how it is dual voltage  but i m not sure if the 1875 will withstand the wattage overseas  i have had this dryer for 3  years and it s still going strong  i love the   34 satin  34  feel of the dryer  the 3 settings  plus the   34 cool jet  34  button   and the diffuser and concentrator are perfect  this dryer has been through the ringer  from airports to duffle bags to being dropped  etc  and it still works like the day i bought it  super easy to clean out the dust in the filter too  the back just screws off  would buy again  dryer is good but after only having it a short time the retractable cord does not work like it should it only retracts half way  great amount of air flow  could be a little hotter though  overall  not a bad hair dryer  very light and easy to handle  i have had many other twin turbo dryers  i feel this one was not even close to the same as the drying power  and it is too small   and doesnt fit right in my hand the heat is no where near as hot as it used to be  the only reason that i didnt return it was because of my own laziness  i will keep it as a second dryer  i will continue to search for something as good as the old twin turbo  it s okay  but not the best  i was looking to spend less than 20   on it  for the money  it s okay  but it is not the best  giving it one star because i haven t even been able to use it   it blew both fuses on my universal adapter  this is my absolute favorite hair dryer ever  it dries my hair very fast since it s ceramic  i love the styling options and my hair gets a lot of volume  easy wall mount   plenty of power with two settings   easy clean filter   the cord is a little short so distance from out let to mirror is a consideration   overall  i would purchase again  i thought i was just buying a cheep retractable cord dryer    it works better than all of my salon quality dryers  so happy  update  i know this dryer was only  20 but it died after  1 5 years  this is the first dryer to ever stop working for me  which isn t the best morning surprise  the rest of my review stands  the concentrator never fell off  br    br   i bought this hair dryer because the concentrator    on my old hair dryer always fell off  one day it started taking my hair with it  i bought the conair turbo styler because the concentrator looked like it would never fall off  i ve had this for a few months now  and it definitely stays put  br    br   the heat is on the lower end  i have fine hair so that works for me  i wouldn t advise this dryer for somebody with very thick hair  i bought this to replace an andis hang up turbo  full sized  that lasted for 7 years  i was very happy with the andis  but i bought the oster due to it being off white instead of white which looks a little more high end  i also got the oster because it had smaller footprint because i installed a new medicine cabinet and i needed a wall mount dryer that would fit in a smaller space  so far  i noticed that it has pretty good blowing power  but it doesn t run as hot as the andis did  which may be better for my hair so it won t get too hot  br    br   the only issue with having a compact hair dryer vs  my previous full sized hair dryer is that the back fan is closer to my head  because of this  when i held the dryer too close to my hair  which is long  and some hair got sucked into the fan in the back  i had to stop the dryer and untangle my hair from the fan   this is no fault of oster  i just have to get used to a shorter length of hair dryer  just letting others know what to expect  so far i am pleased with the oster  br    br   eta  it is july 2014  and it hasn t even been a year that i ve owned this dryer and my oster has already died  i m going to request a replacement  i m a hairdresser  so i can sometimes go through blowdryers easily  however  this one has lasted over a year  i ve bought twinturbo dryers before  but this model is compact enough that i can transport it from work to home easily  but the quality is not sacrificed  i love the black matte plastic  too  it makes any scratches or dings practically invisible  i have been using the blo   go for nearly two years and love it   i have been looking for a second one that also can suction to a wall or mirror   and am disappointed this is unavailable at this time   it s been like that for awhile   please start selling these again or tell me where i can get one   thanks  i love this hair dryer it work really well  heat is evenly distributed throughout the blower  easy to use  i never have issues using this dryer  ok hair drying but the heat setting don t quite work perfectly  the hot setting on high air setting messes up my curls a little  but the hot setting on low air doesn t get hot enough  other than that it is great for travel and unlike a lot of the reviews about the cord retraction  problem i didn t find that a problem  you just need to pull it out all the way and hold the button steady for it to gain momentum  sometimes i have to help it with the last inch or two  but definitely it s not a big issue  what more can you expect from a tiny motor of this size  i would rather have this than a good motor that would also make the hair dryer heavier  br   i am happy with what i have got for this price  i still think as far as travel dryers go this the best one i have seen so far  i have enjoyed this hair dryer overall   i previously had a conair and in comparison i think this one is of higher quality   it is heavier than my previous one  but i think this is due to the quality of the motor which i am hoping does in fact help this hair dryer to last longer than most   it does feel slightly awkward due to the weight and length of the barrel  but nothing that i found as a hindrance   i noticed that several other reviewers had trouble with getting their hair stuck in the rear vent  i have long hair and have yet to have this problem  but i do agree that a cap of some sort would be nice to prevent this  br    br   the hair dryer includes three different heat settings  i found one to be quite hot  one warm  and one cool   it also included two speeds   i have found that the fastest speed is best used with attachments otherwise my long hair would get quite tangled   as far as time  it seems slightly faster  though not as noticeable as i thought it might  br    br   my hair does feel quite smooth and seems to be less heat damaged from my drying  though i think time will tell if this hair dryer is truly salon quality  i hotwired this to the wall in guest bathroom  i am happy and they are too  it has two settings and looks nice on the wall just as a hotel set up  thanks for a great hair dryer  great hair dryer  perfect power and the tools that it came with are great for styling your hair  the best part of this product is that the cord is retractable  perfect for staying organized  i searched all over town for a hair dryer like this one before checking amazon   i had one of those universal combs and none of dryers would fit it and it is so hard to find dryers with comb attachments that won t break in my thick hair   this dryer not only fits the universal comb  but it comes with its own comb which works just as well   it gets pretty hot  so it doesn t take that long to dry my hair   i would definitely recommend this dryer  i love this hair dryer  it dries very fast and accurately  i love the 3 heat settings and 3 drying levels  great product  i purchased the 1875 shine styler hair dryer because my 17 year old conair 1600 started to throw blue sparks when i changed the settings  i really like the controls on the 1875 because they are comfortable while gripping the hair dryer and they are easy to use  i held a lot of hair dryers in stores and found this one to be light weight and comfortable to hold  the price was right too   19 99  i m a guy who just needs a hair dyer to dry my hair every once in a while  my hair is only a few inches long  the 1875 watt thermal shine styler does the job  bought the first one at an rv store and it lasted for several years of daily use  when it finally wore out  bought another one  same model   after about 6 months of use  the wires in the handle had been pinched and shorted out and damaged the unit  bought another one  my wife has been using it for the last several months and this morning there was a pop and the low speed quit  i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because is  a really nice unit that we have liked  but wondering now about the quality control on recently produced units  great dryer   button placement could be better  i seem to accidentally turn the heat down  it works really well though  i expect to get more than 15 months out of a hairdryer  especially since i travelled for work about 30  of the time and didn t bring this hairdryer with me   this hairdryer replaced the blackbird  which lasted over 3 years   i liked that this dryer was powerful and hot   it dried my hair quickly  and i had no problems blowing my very wavy hair out straight   i d love to get another one  but am trying a babyliss this time in the hopes that it will last longer  sometimes you get what you pay for  this is one of those cases  there s no lint on the back that would cause it to overheat or anything  one day it just started switching to a warm cool setting even though it was set to hot  as time went on  it just doesn t even get hot anymore at all  warm at best  i had this less than 1 year and always kept the back cleared of lint so this is just a junk product  i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does come with attachments that similarly priced dryers don t usually come with  and there s a removable cover thing on the lint trap in the back that makes it way easier to clean  you can remove it and wash it off in the sink in 2 seconds  but it doesn t work long so don t expect much  the wind is strong when it works fine  however  it does not work today  i only bought it for 9 months  i know cheap stuffs do not last long  but my expectation is at least one year  i would rather choose a more expensive but better quality one next time  i like this hair dryer  but it gets way too hot  i can only let it run for about 30 seconds before i need to push the cool air button  i also wish it had a separate switch for the heat setting  like warm  hot  cold  nice hot blow drye  lots of power  it is a little heavy so be prepared for that weight to start hitting you at the end of the day in your rotator cuff but i can breeze through any blowdry with ease  love it  best blow dryer i ve had yet  the diffusser stays attached securely and it s not that loud  i love that it has different controls for the temperature and speed  this is a good hairdryer and i have no complaints with how it dries my hair   i am a little surprised by the reviewers that have said this is a light weight hair dryer   i find this hair dryer to be a good bit heavier than my previous conair hair dryer that i had to replace   the controls are easy to operate and it is even easy to change settings while drying my hair   i love the color   it is a pretty vibrant purple   overall i am happy with my purchase but i do wish it was a little lighter in weight  wife s favorite color is purple  so this was a must have for her  the dryer works really good and looks good also  great product  br   powerful and dry hear fast  a bit heavy though but once you get used to it  it is doing its job perfectly my wife purchased this hair dryer after reading so many positive reviews   it s still going strong a year later  but she complains her fingers get in the way of the buttons on the handle  turning the hair dryer off while she is trying to dry her hair  i had just used it once last night but i know it just what i want  strongly recommend  it s better than what i had expected  an excellent product  sets up in seconds  easy to sit under  temp control is perfect  i love hot tools  the best made brand  i bought this item for my wife and i ask her if she liked it and she simply said she loved it  i think the retracktable cord is a main reason and the ther is it doesn t make her hais as static as other blow dryers   we have 3 of these  one in each bathroom  they are great and hold up to moderate usage very good  nice little blow dryer  it s not too big or too small  it gets nice and hot  my only complaint is the length of the cord  this cord is a little longer than the length of any iphone or ipad cord  3 ft   i d say this cord is about 4 or 5 ft long and only long enough for you to use in the bathroom with a socket close to a mirror   other then the cords length it s a perfect go to blue dryer  so far pretty good  i have been using this dryer for a couple of months now and it gets the job done  what more can be said  it was a good price and it dries my hair   after about 6 months the dryer smoked and the motor burned out  now  this may just have been one bad unit out of thousands sold  and the company rapidly replaced it  which is good  not so good is that they did not send me a return label  so i paid to ship it  br    br   ordinarily  i would rate this a pretty good dryer  it is reasonably quiet  and it is rated at 1600 watts  so it does not participate in the hair dryer arms race at all stores  where it is impossible to find a lower wattage dryer that will not blow fuses  surprising more people don t complain about that   i would not want to rate it down for burning out  but six months is not reasonable  and this is an appliance that works in the home in a bathroom  which means it should be beyond any danger  br    br   use your discretion  and keep watch to see if more people report this problem  i suppose a report to the cpsc might be in order  just to get a data set  i have long curly hair and i was convinced this wouldn t work  i used to air dry my hair  by sitting in front of huge oscillating fan  needless to say  only the bottom half of my hair dried in front of the fan  but the roots and everything else was a wet droopy mess  so i wanted to try this   especially now that winter is coming  i really don t want to leave my house with wet hair  it dries my whole head from root to tip  and my hair does not come out frizzy  its like the heat locks my hair product   paul mitchell s hair curling lotion  in place  i can fit my entire head and all of my hair in the container  i love that it has a lid in the front to open and close  a timer and it even dries my hair on the lower settings  my only con is i need to find somewhere to store it because it s pretty huge  right now  it s in the dining room  other than that  it was worth every penny  would buy it again  excellent hair dryer  my wife  daughter and guests love them   very well made   seem to last forever   i am installing two more so we have one in each bathroom   the first one is about 10 years old and running strong  i love this hair dryer    it manages to dry your hair with high heat in a gentle way   whatever voodoo they are using  i approve whole heartedly   i like it that my hair feels soft after i use it   after i dry my hair  i use the cool setting on high and gently cool down my whole hair   it feels so nice  it s making me want to wash my hair right now  i am a hairdresser of 40  years   needed this for my very occasional jobs at home   it will do the job   easy to store  biggest reason for this choice  over one on wheels   somewhat noisy  who cares  wonderful heat   could use some more air holes   this is not made as good as the one i had to toss that was more than 40 yrs old   but that is true about everything   can t see how it adjusts in height awesome  retractable cord works great  blowing power is great  light and easy to store  bought it for our new camper  so far so great   it dries my hair in a jiffy  i like the looks of it too  and the accessories  it is a 1875 watt hairdryer  loved this hair dryer when i first received it   now it makes all types of noise and smells    filter is clean so i have no idea what the problem is   dryer is totally sealed so can t even open it to see what the problem is     i like this hairdryer a lot  even with the heaviness  which i associate with quality for some reason  it s a comfortable dryer and feels good in the hand without fatiguing it  despite the weight  in the past  i ve had the problem of my long hair getting sucked into the dryer  i did not have that issue with this dryer  the one minor complaint i have is that the hot setting didn t feel as hot as i would have liked  the hot feels like more of a medium setting to me so it look a bit longer than i m accustomed to to dry my hair  as far as the ceramic ionic nature of the dryer  i m not fully sure how this works with a blow dryer since it doesn t actually touch the hair like a flat iron or curling iron  the science has been lost on me  br    br   this comes with a spot dryer attachment and a diffuser attachment but i don t normally use those  br    br   overall a great dryer  i used this every day   our master bathroom is small which is why i wanted a wall mount   works perfectly and installed in minutes  first tried this item at a hotel  i received compliments on my hair  it also has a nice long cord   i got one for myself and gave one as a give  my wife found this model hair dryer at a motel and fell in love with it  i wrote the model number down and bought this one  it has a nice hang up bracket  a built in night light  moves a surprising amount of air and works great  certainly powerful  and excellent value for money  other that the cord being a bit short  i m very satisfied with it i ll admit i bought this blow dryer only because of the color  i love anything and everything green  br    br   i really love the attachment on this hair dryer it works very well when i am drying my hair to get it somewhat strait before i flat iron it  it s pretty much the only reason i won a hair dryer  i gets nice and hot  but not to hot to were i feel like i m about to burn myself  br    br   i really love how the handle turns and folds up  it fits in my bathroom drawer perfectly  br    br   i d reccamend this to anyone who just needs a simple blow dryer for simple things  also if you need to save on space because of the folding handle  i bought this for my wife because i became convinced she was going to go deaf eventually from her previous hairdryer  i found it deafening from down the hallway but she s running the thing for minutes a day right next to her ears     br    br   this one is remarkably quieter   still a noisy gadget  but what a difference   much lower decibels and a more pleasant  lower frequency sound as well  br    br   the jury seems to be out on whether ions do anything or not  but after a couple weeks  use she did remark that it worked faster and she thought her hair looked better too  my husband i travel a lot   there are times we need a blow dryer   the dryer is small and doesn t weigh much   we keep it in our suitcase all the time   its perfect  nice blower for personal use    it heats well  i have fine and long hair and it took me 25 min to dry all my hair which is a pretty good time consider that a professional dries my hair in 45 min love love love this blow dryer twin turbo is the way to go    it s fast and it s easy and it gets the job done       i would recommend this to anyone used this in a hotel while away and researched it  found on amazon at a great price and bought two   nice  lightweight hairdryer that gets the job done quickly   would highly recommend  it came very soon after ordering it   it performs exactly as it was advertised   it is very easy to use and the recoiling power  cord is very convenient  great product and came as described  ordered few months ago and still working awesome  great product for great price  i would recommend it maybe i should expect the shelf life of a hair dryer to be less than two years  because that is how long this dryer will work   i purchased locally  and spent  35 99   it was ok while it lasted  but certainly nothing special   even though the amazon price is lower  i would still say pass  this hair dryer dries my fine straight hair very quickly and is rather quiet for a hair dryer  it s a little on the heavy side  so if you have hair that takes a long time to dry  you might want to get a lighter dryer so your arm doesn t get tired  it is better than what i expect and gives me more than i want  this hair dryer has three shifts which are perfect for me  it also can swithch to the cold model  loves it  highly recommend plugged it in  dried my hair  br   brilliant  br    br   cord is a little short  if your socket is waaaay far away from where you normally sit or stand  but the dryer itself is good for what it does  not so hot that you feel like you are burning yourself  but effective in drying my thicker hair  br    br   i like it  this is the best dryer i have ever owned    br   the only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is because it showed 2800 watts when i ordered it  yet when i received it  there were 2200 watts   still ok     yet a little misleading    br   excellent product     can t go wrong     how great can a hair dryer be   aren t they all the same   well  as is true with many things  all hair dryers are not created equal  and this was a great find   it seems a simple thing    just turn it on and dry the hair    but i ve been frustrated many times with hair dryers that are too strong  blowing like a hurricane no matter what the setting  too weak  barely putting out a cough of air  or too cold  or too hot  or that just fry themselves after a few months of use   and  specifically  i wanted a travel hair dryer  since my last supposed   34 dual voltage  34  hair dryer went up in smoke  literally   when trying to use it on the other voltage setting   so  this hair dryer has been a welcome treat   not only does it do as it claims  in being dual voltage  but you still got low and high settings  and the great   34 cool shot  34  at either voltage setting   air flow and heat are consistent and the low and high settings are really just that    less heat and air  or more heat and air    and are noticeable in difference   comes with two attachments  as shown  handle folds  plus the back opens up for cleaning   i have never found such a great hair dryer at even far higher prices  let alone at the great price for this one   if you re looking for a great hair dryer that also can travel the world with you  this one is the one  this is my favorite hairdryer ever   it s amazing how powerful it is for such a small dryer   luckily  i stumbled upon this at a hotel i was staying at and couldnt believe how much i liked it   as soon as i got home  i got online and ordered it   i have had many dryers before this  but this is the best and the best price   highly recommend  i highly recommend this dryer if you have thick or coarse hair that needs to be smoothed or straightened  if you are the type of person who just flips the hair around and smooths with fingers  this might be too much dryer for you  but i have no experience with that kind of hair  this is my first professional hair dryer  and i couldn t be happier  i have medium coarse hair  mixed race  ringlets  coarse but not kinky  3b maybe   that is currently just below chin length  i m super skeptical about product claims  so i did a lot of research  i read an article about a comparison of several models that convinced me of the effectiveness of titanium  and i knew i wanted 2000 watts just cause i wanted as much power as possible  there aren t too many dryers with those 2 features  so after reading the positive reviews  i decided on this model  from the first time i used it  i was very pleased  my hair was definitely softer and smoother  i never believed a hairdryer could make your hair softer  but this one definitely did  i can also dry my hair much more quickly  but i think that is because with this hair dryer  i am actually able to dry my hair like the hairdresser does  in big sections  using the curve of my head to smooth it out   previously  i always had to dry my hair in 1 2inch sections wrapping around and pulling with a round brush  which takes forever  if i dry my hair that way with this dryer  it still takes about as long  but i don t really get much better results so i don t bother  cons  1  i still have to use a flat iron to smooth my ends  for the life of me  i can t get smooth ends with a hair dryer  i was really hoping this dryer would solve that for me  but instead it has convinced me that it is my technique  not the dryer  2  it really does get hot  i have to use medium heat around the edges of my hairline  and that can still be a little intense  if you have a sensitive scalp  this might be too much dryer for you  3  the nozzles seem kinda cheap  my last hair dryer had  nozzles that snapped on  which made it easier to rotate and change the angle  these nozzles just fit snugly over the barrel and often come off when i try to rotate them  i can t speak to some of the other complaints about this dryer like weight and noise  i wouldn t call this dryer light or quiet  but it doesn t seem particularly loud or heavy to me  personally  i wouldn t want to give up the performance of this dryer for those features  br    br   hope this review helps  and happy styling everyone  a great product but too much for a 66 yr old guy with thinning hair  therefore wife has happily confiscated for her full head of hair  thought all hairdryers were the same  this one is lioke going to a salon  liked it so much   bought one for my daughter  i have fine straight hair that takes hardly anything to dry  but this dryer isn t even up to the task   it blows air on your hair and i m sure speed along the drying process  but i wasn t able to use it for styling as it had neither enough heat nor enough power   the one time i tried i got my hair tangled in the fan despite the screen guard and burned out the motor  works perfectly    i really love this blow dryer and the price is just incredible  i would recommend the blow dryer  i have been very happy with this hair dryer  my daughters and i have all tested it  and we ve had consistently good results  we have long  medium  and short hairstyles between us  we all have straight  fine hair and a lot of it  our hair tends to get flat  not frizzy  br    br   the dryer does work faster than other dryers we ve had  and it is quieter  blowouts result in shinier  smoother hair than before  i like the multiple settings  although there is a learning curve  and i found myself pushing the wrong switches at first  the cold shot of air is a real help in styling  especially for short hair styles  we ve used the concentrator  and it fits securely and stays on  br    br   i thought the dryer was a bit heavy  but my kids  12 and 14  never mentioned the weight  it s been hard to get them to blow dry their hair  but they wanted to use this dryer    a big plus to me  i admit   i d be a stylist if i wanted to give someone a blowout  but i m not and i don t   it s a full sized blow dryer and comes with loop so you can hang it if you wish  i wasn t sure where i wanted to store the dryer  so i temporarily rested in inside the strong box it comes in and tucked the box in my linen closet between a stack of towels and the wall  it s worked so well that i m still using it  but it s a nice looking dryer  and i would display it if my bathroom were larger and had more wall space  it is very powerful  i like it very much       it save me a lot of time to dry hair  ho ho this mini dryer is perfect for travel   i have used it several times and am impressed   it also came with a zipper bag for travel  which was an unexpected surprise   it has a lot of force and does a great job  we were staying in a hotel in dc  the hotel furnished an andis dryer with retractable cord  i enjoyed using it so much so i ordered one as soon as we returned home  it came just a few days later  im very happy with it  for me  i have tried so many different blow dryers for me baby fine and hard to manage hair  and these previously tried blow dryers blew my hair dry fast of course  i have thin hair   however  they dulled my hair and also damaged my hair as the drying velocity was much too strong and the heating was just too hot  br   so i tried the conair 1875 blow dryer and was amazed and blown away  no pun intended   this dryer i have found to dry my hair quickly and gently  also  my hair is shinier and much more manageable  br    br   if you have baby fine hair like i do  this is the blow dryer for you  love not having to store a hair dryer and so far the conair is operating great   it s also a great weight and wattage for drying your hair  i researched and read reviews   this was one of the better ones i found   after i received it i opened and used it   the hot is really hot   but good when your hair is really wet   then you can set it on warm and its good  after about 20 years of daily use and many minor repairs  my wife s conair finally bit the and we found this to be the closest replacement model  other than being a little heavier than her original   it still has the features that she needs  very happy with it   maybe it will last as long as the first one  this hair dryer dries fast and it is easy to use because it is lightweight  i carry the dryer in my gym bag  and even though it doesn t fold down  the light weight makes it so i don t mind  there are several settings  which are convenient too  i still have frizz after my hair is dry  but i use a flat iron to fix that  this blow dryer is the greatest hair tool i ve purchased in a long time  i can do my daughters hair now with ease and less pulling out of our thick curly hair  i ve been wanting one of these since 1976 when my last one flew off the top of my car while driving down the street and broke into a thousand pieces  i forgot i left it on top of my car   but i thought they were no longer making them   lo and behold  i was at a hair salon in new orleans  and the hairdresser whipped out one of these babies   i exclaimed how much i missed mine from the 70 s  and she informed me   34 honey  they re still makin these puppies   34   so i am now reunited w  my beloved yellowbird  my wife said that it works great out daughter loves it too  i also ordered some extra combs just in case  i bought this blow dryer about 14 months ago and it worked great when i got it but now it s not blowing strong  it s feels like it s on a low setting instead of high  i m looking for a new blow dryer because i know this one is about to die  my husband and i have used andis hair dryer for years   when ours stopped working  i was worried that i couldn t find them again  so i went on line with amazan and was pleased to find the same brand   we love these dryer and glad to find them again  br    br   thanks br   ruth o dell i would not buy this hair dryer again   i have had it for exactly 1 year and it performed ok until today  it is 5 days past the warranty period and it just broke  sparks started coming out of the back of the unit and my entire bathroom smelled like it was on fire  br   i do not wash my hair daily  this product was used 2 3 times a week  i also regularly cleaned the back filter of any dust or debris  so i am pretty disappointed i only got 12 months out of it  br    br   even before it stopped working i was not all that impressed with it  it dried my shoulder length fine hair in marginally shorter time than a regular dryer and i did not really notice a difference in added shine  br    br   i will be placing an order for this cheap revlon rv544pkf 1875w tourmaline ionic ceramic dryer  which i purchased to replace my mil s ancient one last year  this revlon hair dryer i am really impressed with  super light weight and dries hair in record time  picture is very deceiving  the hair dryer is bigger than the pic  however  good quality for the price  and i get great use out of it  let s face it  i really just bought this because it looked like the manliest looking hairdryer out there  br   but i will say  my hair is nice and soft and much easier to hold its style  i ve even used it for manly tasks such as drying primer  and glue  at first i was with everyone else on the thing not staying in place and repeatedly falling out  i figured out that it has to be locked  if you twist it hard enough  it locks in place  i can now move freely and don t have to keep still thinking the hose will fall out  cause it won t    so this is a great product  used it to deep condition my hair and i have no complaints  the brush attachment serves no purpose though  but it did feel good on my scalp when used as a regular brush  i have very long  thick hair  so i don t think i will ever be 100  happy with any blowdryer  this one does a very good at drying my hair in a reasonable amount of time  this is an awesome alternative to the  85 00 blowdryers at sally s  this hair dryer really can t be beaten for the price  it gets the job done and also comes with a diffuser and a concentrator  br    br   the barrel is very wide  moves plenty of air  and is one of the quietest hair dryers i ve used  but also definitely does not have that strong of a fan  i don t mind this usually  but sometimes if my bangs are acting up i d really like a large amount of air heat to put them in place  usually the concentrator is fine for this but it d be nice to have a bit more flow  br    br   the diffuser is also very nice  i ve never really used a diffuser until getting this but it generally keeps my thick  curly hair frizz free as long as i don t dry it completely  if i dry it 100   then i definitely get some frizz on the top layer of my hair  br    br   overall  very happy with this product for the price  the air coming out of dryer is room temperature at best and the cord rewind does not work  the cord only rewinds part of the way  br   the only feature left to work is the folding handle   that works fine  though has standard features  the best thing about this hair dryer is practically weightless  almost as light as a feather  love it  i got this compact hair dryer to replace the same model  which i d had for a decade or two but the cord started to wear  i found my old one to be very reliable and with a surprisingly strong air flow for the compact size of the dryer  i d taken it on several dozen trips and used it at home often as well  this new one seems to be of equally good quality and has all the features i d liked on my old one  i was so glad conair still makes it  best dryer i have ever used    expect when it start over heating   hope to see a fix soon     br    br   highly recommended         love this     exactly what i was needing and wanting   it s fast drying and the retractable cord is great and fold down handle is very nice for storage and travel easy to use  instructions clear  has plenty of power  very light and small for travel  have begun using it every day instead of my regular hair dryer  no complaints on functionality but it is way bigger and heavier then i expected based on my previous cord keeper folding handle conair   i supose i should have paid more attention to the size specs before ordering but i guess i assumed a style that folds up would be space conscious all the way around   if you own a seperate hair dryer for travel  this could be a good option   i think it would be best for the teen age crowd  it is awfuly pink too  couldn t find the hair dryer with comb in the stores so i was quite pleased to find it on amazon   the andis ceramic ionic styler hair dryer lives up to my expectations  it s everything i hoped to find   i especially like the high heat setting for drying more quickly yet the fan speed doesn t increase so that it doesn t make styling harder   i would buy this hair dryer again     my customers  and my family love it so i love   i will continue to promote it the best way i can   i put the conair 134r hair dryer on my guests bathroom wall and my visiting company love the idea because they do not have to lug a hair dryer along when they visit me   i also has a night light on it  the dryer works great  the only problem is the hose won t stay on  it falls off when using it on my clients  i love this   very quick and easy to mount on the wall   very convenient and no mess on the counter   always available when you want it  love this  it s stronger than most blow dryers i ve used in the past 3 years  the look is very professional and the color is a deep purple with soft pink  i should have purchased the hair wand that went with it  matchy matchy  this hair dryer is about as good as it gets  br    br   great product in a compact size and a low price that doesn t reflect the product   it works as good as any large expensive hair dryer  br    br   great for home use and packs in a suitcase for travel nicely  this is a great blow dryer  the air comes out nice and strong and it gets the job done fast  this dryer is great i have had it for almost a year and haven t had any problems whatsoever  br   very impressive  you see these at the better motels but dont find them at the big box stores   my wife wanted this in her bathroom at home  ordered this one   got it fast   just what we wrer looking for great vender we bought this dryer  because we have a tiny bathroom with little storage space   it was easy to hang  but the bracket holds the unit away from the wall a bit   it has adequate power and the controls are easy   we are very pleased with it  my wife and i got this to replace the same hair dryer we had used for years   the old one started making a noise that sounded like lint was getting into the fan blower chamber   in an attempt to clean it  i broke it    i know  smooth move    long story short is that we were amazed to find the exact same dryer on amazon for  13  so we snagged it   great dryer for the price and my wife and are are happy that we have a new hairdryer that we know will last a long time  as long as i stay away from disassembling it    fyi  the sound the old one was making was no big deal   i just felt handy for an hour and i broke it  the best  doesn t burn ur ears dries effectivly if it ever stops working im coming back to u for anotherone   i luvv it i luvv it love love love this hair dryer makes my hair blow out nicely without the frizz nice finishing touch  thank you  i ordered this for my craft room to help glue dry   i wanted something small so it was easy to store   it is the perfect size and has two speeds which makes it great when working on crafts   i do wish it had hook or something from which i could hang it   it arrived on time in good packaging   i would even consider buying another for when we travel because of it size and weight  completely functional br   love it br   small criticism br   the plug in cord should  be able to be shortened easily br   maybe toggle bolts to mount it would be better have had several before  wife like the convince of being hung on wall   this is our third unit  wish it was more durable  the store send the item just in time  and the equipment looks and works nicely  it worth a try for anyone  this is an excellent little hairdryer   it is hard to find a hairdryer that produces more than a weak stream of air  and this one certainly does   it blows lots of air and dries your hair really quickly   i ve had mine for about a year  and it is still going strong   i just bought my mother one for her birthday  she loves it   as well as a second one for myself for travel  if you re looking for a travel blow dryer that only blows   34 luke warm  34  air  then this is the one to get  but if you want it blow hot air like other blow dryers do  this one won t do it for you  we first used one in a hotel we stayed and my commented that exactly what we need for home  so i did a search and found them on amazon and the rest is history   we love it  br    br   thanks  i was in a super big hurry and tried this out before reading the directions and without my bathroom mirror   immediately got my hair stuck in the intake and had to turn it off and attempt to use it later    next time i tried it i made sure to read the directions thoroughly and use the mirror to get used to the air intake in the back   my previous blow dryers have intakes on the sides  this in take is larger for more air flow but you have to get used to keeping it further away as it will suck in hair as well as air   the cover does come off easily for the in take so you can clean it out   i love that it s intended to last 4 years   one thing i did notice is that you aren t supposed to store it in a damp area so i keep it in my bedroom and just take it into the bathroom as needed   the intake has a wire mesh screen  that could possibly rust so i appreciate this extra advice   it does seem to make your hair nice and silky   update  died and the customer service was impeccable  thanks remington  my old conair finally burned out after about 20 yrs  i have been looking for something similar  conair now wants over 40 00 for the one i had  well im glad i found this andis  its very similar and fantastic   its a tad bit smaller which makes it easier to handle  powerful as hell  same controls and a narrow barrel which concentrates the heat where i want it  not all over the place like these wide barrel models  nice long cord too  i m tempted to buy another just in case they ever discontinued it  i love this thing and for the price its a steal   i ve dried my hair twice with it and it made my hairstyle work easier than with my old hairdryer that is losing it s power   happy with the temperatures and heat  this is the 3rd one i ve owned  i now have 2  keep one in the guest bathroom   love the settings  how well it dries my hair without frizziness and the variety of settings  have been looking for a dryer likke this ne for a while now and i finally found it  great product to own this hair dryer is so good that i ordered another one just in case the one i bought 4 years ago dies   i have not had to use the new one yet  just have it for back up  i can not be without this hair dryer for making my curly hair straight use it with ceramic hairbrush  can order together  for sleek straight  non frizzy hair  i was so tired of having my hair dryer stored in a drawer  with a cord that tangled up in everything     then i found this little wonder and i m a happy camper   it is a little larger than those you find in hotel rooms  but it looks nice  has a nice feel in your hand and most importantly  dries your hair perfectly   it has two speeds which are great for styling  and a cord that is never in your way   i really love this hair dryer  i bought this due to the very high reviews   i agree   it is a great product   it is a bit heavy though   so i do not use it every day i love my wall mount hair dryer  it s right there when i need it  i would highly recommend this to br   all my friends  works like a charm   doesn t get hot enough to burn your scalp and the attachment helps to better focus the area you want to dry  purchase this hair dryer to use for travel  it folds and is small but has lots of power  works great the wife loves this   she s in sales and is very particular about her hair  neatness really counts in her business  the item is all it was stated to be  we ll packaged delivered on time  she can t stop talking about this item  she s telling all hers friends  i love it    it s  well built  strong stream and easy to manage    it s the best one i ve ever owned  it was such a pity to receive this and plug it in only to find that it didn t work  the lights came on and the unit got hot but the air didn t blow  i was looking forward to using this as the reviews from others was outstanding  had to return it and didn t replace it  br    br   revised  december 1  2015 br   this new review is long overdue  br   not all hair dryers are created equal  i never knew there was such a difference a hair dryer could make on the styling of hair   after i had returned the doa hair dryer  onei beauty contacted me wanting me to be happy with my purchase and offered to replace the unit  just the customer service was golden to me until i realized their product was equally as golden  br    br   after i received the replacement i immediately had to wash and style my hair  i can t believe how shiny and soft my hair felt  it s so easy to style my hair now  and it s quiet and light   if you re on the fence in purchasing this hair dryer  do not hesitate  buy it  i can t thank you enough  onei  for making me so happy  sorry it took so long to tell you how much you are appreciated  really pleased with this blow dryer  quiet and easy to use   looks great also love the color   love the retractable cord i love this blow dryer  it s very light  br   i didn t really notice quicker drying times than my old chi dryer which i loved  br   i gave it to my daughter and i got this one for myself  good product  very good hair styler  i like that you can buy tools for it if you need them  it has just the right amount of power to easily dry hair most of the b b s we stayed in during our 3 week european trip had hairdryers in the bathrooms  and these were in small towns    however  i did use this hairdryer several times and really liked it  this dryer works fine  it does just what i wanted  the color is quite pink  and it s very small  almost like a toy  smaller than i thought it would be  it would be really nice for a young girl  it will be great for traveling too  it serves the purpose for me and works fine  bought this as a gift and my wife absolutely loves it  she says its the best hair dryer she has ever had  and i cant complain about the price  i would recommend this to anyone  this is the most pretty dryer that i have seen in a long time   we haven t used it yet b ut it looks very nice and was a t a great price  loved it every dollar i spent for this hairdryer was worth it every diff user accessory comes with the hairdryer is better than the other especially the one that has o comb in front is extremely convenient for hair straitening  i had one for a year or two  but i dropped it   so  i ordered the same one   pretty much perfect   note that the retractable cord didn t work on the first one i got  but they replaced it right away   i love the retractable cord and folding style  and the ionic drying really works fast   really good dryer  i am very pleased with this purchase     my hair looks great and drys in half the time of my old dryer which was over 15 years old  didn t know what i had been missing by not having a tourmaline ceramic dryer great size  lots of power  perfect size  great price  love the extras  but don t care for pink  had no choice  i used this same one in a hotel in vegas and it was amazing my hair looked just like i had it done at the salon  so excited i bought two one for me one for my sister  mine was borrowed by a friend never got back ordered another one this one was defective bad     i literally used it the very first time fresh out of the box and i swear there were sparks coming out of the outlet  unplugged scared thought it was the outlet plugged it in a different outlet sparks again omg anyway i tossed it in the garbage wasn t worth me packaging and going to post office etc and i was on vacation and had to go buy a new one while on vacay  i loved it but the electrical problem was not good  i wanted a hair dryer that would work both in the us and when traveling abroad  this dryer functioned well in europe and everyone borrowed it  it is small  comes with it s own zipper storage bag and is very light weight  it works great  i love the color  compact style  easy to work and handle  it will travel nicely as well  it kicks out the heat doesn t take up space  neat  nicely sized  blows like an hurricane you  ll love it   needs an man to install there isn t anyway i could 50 year old women  this is a good styling tool to give a pre teen who wants their own   just one button for low and high and it dries hair really good   there is also the button in the back for a shot of cold air  i had an old vidal sassoon digital dryer  which is no longer being made  that finally went out  i bought this as a replacement  i don t like it as well as the digital  but it works  the hot setting is almost too hot  so i use medium  still dries very fast  great product for the price  cheap and real strong heat  i definitely highly recommend this product  it works tremendously well  drying my hair has never required much time since i live in an arid climate  yet this dryer seems to dry my hair more quickly   to increase the volume   very pleased with this product  i just love my new hair dryer   my husband got me this after i learned that i have some hearing lost    been using the dryer everyday for more than a month    the sound from this dryer is very soft and soothing unlike all the other hair dryers i ve owned   what i love about this dryer is that i no longer have to go clear across to another part of our home to dry my hair in the morning when my family is still asleep   i can simply close my bedroom door and people in the other bedrooms aren t disturbed by the sound of my dryer   this is a huge plus for us   this dryer dries fast and makes my hair looks voluminous   this is an appliance that i use at least once every day  it s definitely worth every penny  was pricey  but so far  it is much better than anything else i ve used  i have thick  coarse  wavy hair  drys faster  feels smoother  i am impressed that it does make such a difference  i believe 5 stars are very rare  so really a 4 star is a good one  just need to see how long it lasts  this works wonders with kinky hair  use it to straighten hair on kids after washing  great that you can adjust the heat typical hair dryers are loud  not so with this remington silk ceramic dryer  and my sensitive eared golden retriever is the proof  he literally came running to get his head dried after his bath  so it s a pleasure for humans as well  with no piercing whine  br    br   this is my first ceramic styling tool  and i ve found that my hair is silky without frizz and quickly dried every time  so ceramic really does make a difference  this is a sturdy  sleek dryer  with great heat  power  and cool blast button for setting your style  br    br   the only reason i didn t rank this dryer a 5 star  is because of the placement design of the setting buttons  they are right where your fingers wrap around and hold on  and unfortunately my natural grip keeps changing the settings while drying  however  for the drying performance  it s worth the occasional inconvenience  this is a good hair dryer for the money   quick drying time but it s a bit heavy and kind of loud   i bought it for travel but because of the weight  i wouldn t recommend it for that   home use is fine and it s compact because of the retractable cord and folding handle   i have another andis dryer and believe andis makes a good product  we now have two of this identical model  the first one worked out well so we bought another for a second bathroom  i can t speak to whether it makes my hair any shinier  but it does a good job of drying my hair and that s all i ask for  it does have different settings    high  low  warm  cool  my husband uses the lowest settings to blow dry the dog  i have noticed that the exterior doesn t get as hot as my old dryer so i don t have to be careful where i set it when i m done  i have no idea what to do with the finger curly thingy attachment    maybe i need curly hair to appreciate its use  this is light weight and has a lot of bells and whistles   however  for smoothing hair  i thing the babylis pro babtt5585 tourmaline titanium 3000 dryer reg and travel  are much better  this model is a little bigger than our older wall mount blow dryer   i like the smaller size better  but needed to go with something that might last longer   the on off switch for this model is on the hanger  the wall mount  and not on the dryer itself   i prefer the switch to be on the handle of the dryer   those details aside  the force and heat of the dryer is excellent for its size   it dries my hair quickly   i m happy with this dryer   will have to wait to see what its longevity is  perfect size for home use   we have one in our rv and bought one for our home  this is a quality product  this hair dryer is exactly what i was looking for   it looks great in our bathroom and i like the way the cord stays on the hook   no more getting the cord caught in the drawer   the night light is a soft green and just the right amount of light in the bathroom at night to see where you are going  my faithful old hair dryer blew out its last breath and this one has taken its place  the heft is perfect and well balanced  with 3 heat settings  none of which are as hot as my old one and 2 speeds  this dryer makes short work of drying my  medium length slightly wavy hair  in order to give it a fair trial  we used the diffuser and dried my granddaughter s waist length curly red hair  also swiftly done  and the curls remained intact  i hope this dryer has as long a life as my old one because i really like it  light weight and very smoothing  still giving my hair body  great color  too  dries quickly and easy to hold and turn  everything was great for about 6 month  the it stop working  why they keep selling a product that only last 6 months   better to take them from the market entirely and replace it with on that works longer even id it is more expensive   one thing is certain  i will not buy a remington drier ever   nice lite and compact design  perfect for traveling in europe on rail or rental car when you have to pack lite i have long fine hair  i very rarely use a hairdryer  but when camping  traveling etc there is a need  having dual voltage is a plus  this one is simple  reliable  dries my hair nicely on low  and in short does what it should do  really like the supplied cone for directed drying  it works well and dries my hair in a short amount of time   light weight too   also like that i can hang it up  i have only used this hair dryer twice   the dryer gets just as hot as the ones in the salon these are on the wall on our bathrooms  they look great  were easy to install and use   they really help to clean up the clutter  if it s possible to have a love affair with a hair dryer  this would be the one   the dryer s best feature is how quiet it is compared to the many that i have owned over the past  well let s just say 4 decades   the other advantages are the multiple heat cool settings  length of the power cord and the cool shot button   all controls are arranged conveniently so you don t mistakenly flip the wrong switch while using   dries my color treated fine shoulder length hair with little or no frizz and have actually cut back by at least half  the use of anti frizz and shine boosting products so think of the   savings there   only thing i would change are the lack of detail in the instruction manual  but thanks to this review section it s not really needed   you won t be disappointed  replacing an old one  works well just not quite as lightweight or as hot as my old one  would recommend  though  i had another andis product that failed after 11 months but it was no longer available   returned it to andis and they replaced it with this model   nice features   extra long 9 10  rubber cord which will hold up better than the usual 6  vinyl cords   i usually avoid these high velocity dryers because they typically have a loud  high pitched whine that can damage hearing   this one does not  very low pitch  acceptable noise level  nice product   two speeds  3 heats plus a cool button  this is a really nice hair dryer   handle folds as advertised and cord retract works   fits nicely into a travel bag   price performance is excellent and recommend as a good value worth the investment  i needed to replace my dryer quickly as the dog chewed the plug off of the cord of the old one   based on reviews  i ordered the onei dryer   it is lightweight  quiet     and really can get hot so less drying time   i am quite pleased with it   and the seller even sent a follow up email to ensure my satisfaction with the product   i call that excellent customer satisfaction   great price  great product  and i love the retractable cord   comes with the two attachments that work great  buy this one  i chose this hair dryer simply because i saw in a news article that it was highly rated and i love it  not sure why reviews are about the button placement and weight  i am like such a baby with heavy items and this is fine  as for the buttons  you get used to it after a couple of uses  great product and it definitely dries faster and is pretty  i purchased this because i wanted a wall mounted dryer with sufficient power to dry my shoulder length hair  i liked the cord storage and night light features  as well as the fact that we could use it on 1200 or 1600w settings based on who in the family is using it  it seemed to have the ingredients for a great little wall mounted dryer  however  the dryer keeps shutting itself off  motor just stops blowing  when i dry my hair for more than 3 4 minutes  once it cools down for a minute or two it starts again  but i have to tell you  this is a seriously annoying problem  i would not buy this again  and am pretty disappointed  so the bad news is that it doesn t get as hot as i would prefer   it barely gets the job done and i m a guy w  short thinning hair   i am sure ladies w  thick  long  wet hair will require more time drying w  this dryer  br    br   the   s are that it s simple  compact  has a good working retractable cord   has a deeper air flow sound that is easier on the ears than a high pitched blow dryer  this is a great dryer  it is the second i ve put in our home  this one has just the right power and heat   i love this blow dryer    i have never really put much thought into the types of blow dryers i have used in the past  i thought severe breakage  damage and dry hair were the negatives that came with the territory  boy  was i wrong    this blow dryer dries my hair really fast and the results are great  my hair is much silkier and not dry at all  i can almost skip the flat iron  and i have really course curly hair    i have used the dryer twice so far and my breakage has been reduced dramatically    this dryer is lightweight and i love the 2 concentrator nozzles that come with it  the cord is nice and long as well    although it was expensive  i think i have found a winner    my old   34 chi  34  can t touch this    i got exactly what i needed  the product was absolutely perfect and matched the exact description on the product information  purchased it online and then saw it in the store for almost double the price as it was here   great buying experience  this dryer is actually and excellent value for what it is being sold for on amazon  about  28    the power and heat control is a good as units i have paid over  50 for   the shape is good and it feels very comfortable in my hand   i have fairly short hair so i don t need to use the attachments but they come in handy for those with long strands that need to isolate and concentrate the air   the switches make the heat easy to adjust  making it good for drying a pet  i try to not use heat to dry my dog    overall a good unit  my 20 yr old dryer died    and i replaced it with this one  it is wonderful  works well and the heat settings are easy to change  i bought this to take with me when i travel as the one i had used before did not have the ionic thing   i had not even tried it out for myself when my grandson took it and uses it every day   he raves about it  so i guess if a picky 18 year old likes it  then there is nothing more to be said   the cord really does retract quickly  so watch out  this is my second conair ionic hairdryer  this was exactly what i wanted and was not disappointed  love the retractable cord  the folding handle and the 120 220 option for traveling  this hair dryer is really quiet compared to what i m used to  which is great   it dries my hair quickly but hasn t over dried it  i have really fine hair    it s also pretty light compared to my last hair dryer   the only issue i have with it is i sometimes accidentally hit the off button or the temperature setting as i m using it   these buttons are located on the side of the handle and if you re not careful you can easily switch your settings or shut off your dryer   since this is only a minor inconvenience i gave it four stars because other than what i just mentioned  this hair dryer works great  compact and powerful  br   this hairdryer works great on 220 v in europe  it has both   34 low  34  and   34 high  34  setting available  my 5 year old is taking on more responsibility with her personal care   my hairdryer was much too big and heavy for her to manage on her own   i found this dryer and it is absolutely perfect   it is lightweight and the right size for her little hands   she loves the color and the zebra storage pouch it comes with   one minor complaint is that the high setting is loud and quite shrill  a much higher pitch than my blow dryer  very powerful and works great   we have these in all bathrooms  i have bought these as gifts and people just love them   mounting is easy and just plug it in  ok for the price   nothing special  i wish i would have chose something else   take too long to dry my hair handy  dual voltage good for foreign travel  compact  nice overall design  this is a great product  i bought one first and it stopped working for some reason  amazon replaced it right away  excellent service  it works good but overheats and shuts off for a while   it works well for what i need  i love the night light  bought 2 of these hair dryers  the first one lasted a year then the fan blades started to crack and then the blades would rub on the housing  thinking it was because i dropped it and cracked the fan blades i bought another  this one lasted 3 months same thing  i will never buy conair again  i love it the product works great  it is not loud and it gets really hot  it was definitely worth the buy  fast shipping too dryer works great and it easy to use and the built in night light in really a nice addition   i really like this item came super quick  thanks amazon   and was a good price   this just was more convenient to me than going to my local target and looking through their whole selection  the reviews on amazon can be so helpful  br    br   its fairly light weight  not too noisy  and seems to work just fine   my previous model was very simliar  a revalon   i see no difference between the two   i m sure the  soft touch  material will eventually peel off like my previous one did but that doesn t really concern me  really like this dryer my cousin has the same one but hers is silver br    br   now i don t have to go to her house  just to blow dry my hair now lol     just arrived  although its cheap  it is good value for money  lots of settings to choose from  dried my hair evenly  great buy  this blow dryer has been really great  the only reason i did not give it the full 5 stars is because the matte film on the dryer has begun to peel off  as far as the function  the blow dryer is really handy and useful  this blow dryer is amazing for it s price  i wanted to buy an expensive   34 better  34  blow dryer  but my finances would not allow that and i settle on this one  i am  however  grateful i chose to buy this blow dryer  it has 3 heat settings  cool  warm and hot which is nice because i can put it on the heat setting which fits my hair the best  it is not ridiculously loud like some of the previous blow dryers i ve own and the cord is sufficiently long  i would recommend buying this blow dryer  even over an expensive   34 better  34  one because i feel like it works just as well as some of the other more expensive hair dryers i ve owned over the years  this hair dryer works great   my hair is dry in half the time and it s much quieter than my old 2500 watt con air  very good   i bought it for my wife and she loves it   i v been buying them for a couple of years  great service  i didn t know there was a difference between cheap dryers and a professional dryer  i have medium length  not thick but not thin blonde hair  it drys quickly  the condition of my hair feels like my hairdresser dried my hair  i am pleasantly surprised by my findings  love the dryer  i am not picky on my driers  how ever the bigger i have always think the more strengh it has  so it is heavy  but i like it  great hairdryer  lots of power  lightweight  retractable cord  the color is great and its the best dryer i ve purchased   i don t know why i have to add more words to my review   a few words should be sufficient   i have used this product for several years on trips outside the us   mostly in europe and israel  this is a very fine product with three important factors  br    br       1600 watt  at this lower wattage  i have never had a problem with foreign electrical power in any room i have rented  br    br       dual voltage  since its a travel hair dryer   i would suggest you keep voltage at 220  i kept switching it every time i came back to us and apparently the switch broke  see customer service below  br    br       customer service  after 2 years of use  they said no problem and replaced the hair dryer immediately  br    br   i wish every company was as consumer friendly as andis and stood behind their products as they do  so i purchased this hair dryer in march 2013 and i need a new one already   while it worked it was good but then things went wrong as i dry my hair i see a spark like when you pull a plug out of the wall   i don t know if it is because i use a metal brush but it snaps and then sparks not so great  very good buy is what i was looking for gifts  it is in very good condition and i have no complaints  thanks  i bought this for travelling  and don t use it at home  and i love it   it is very light weight and small when folded   this is important to me as i have started travelling using only a 21 rolling bag for shorter trips and the 21 bag plus a carry on for trips longer than a week   when trying to save space and weight  every bit helps  br    br   i have used it for several trips and absolutely love it   i use it on the low setting plus add a diffuser and it dries my hair as well as the large one i use when at home  br    br   would definitely buy again  this was a top beauty buy of 2012 and it is a cheap and great buy for a hair dryer works great buy and deal i bought this hair dryer two years ago  and it worked great for its tiny size  however  after flipping the voltage switch to 220 for trips abroad and then back to 120 for domestic trips several times  the switch got misaligned and it was stuck on 220  i figured i d just have to keep it at that setting  as it still worked okay  but a week later the entire handle fell apart in my hand  we had an oster wall dryer for 10 years and it finally died   this new one fit our old oster wall plate for easy installation   power cord can be fitted to correct length so you won t have any excess cord laying around   dryer is strong and not extremely noisy i bought this in late august 2012  i take very good care of my hair products and this barely lasted a year  recently it has overheated very quickly and today it went out and started smoking from the inside and through the cord  pretty disappointing that it didn t last more than a year but you get what you pay for  it s powerful hair dryer  and there re many buttoms to secure the user s safty  i like it  br   while  it s a little noisy  best hairdryer ever my only complaint is that mine cracked after a year  but it still works so i guess not a problem  i do not speak english  but i ll try  very good product  works well  has the necessary heat levels  i have not submitted any flaw  i recommend  is light  not heavy  my experience has been good with this product  i am very happy with this hairdryer  it is very powerful  i have a long hair and it usually takes me a lot of time to dry my hair  but with this hairdryer i m done for 5 min  it is also very light and comfortable  i would definitely recommend this product  it is not light weight  and does not blow dry hair fast  the only thing it has going for it is it s quieter than the one i have  br   i was looking for a good lightweight blow dryer  it does not compare to the t3 good  dry fast  except for the size  it is too big to take it on travel  it can t be folded  i owned the model before this one for about 8 years  it was fantastic and worked as well as it did the day i bought it  until its coil lit up and a curl of smoke came out the blower  alas  it was a sad day  i specifically bought this one based on the performance of the other  and it s not lived up to par  by a long shot  br    br   i bought this dryer 6 months ago and the retractable cord already doesn t work  that s the whole reason i wanted this model  this one is heavier  hotter  and the cool shot is really just warm  not to mention  it s hot pink  br    br   in all  i m very disappointed with this dryer  and will look for another retractable one next time  i don t recommend getting this one  if that is the feature luring you  br    br     update   sept 2014 br   this hairdryer totally died a month ago  i d had it 18 whole months  and it completely quit working  no fireworks  no warning  just plugged it in  and nothing  i tried several outlets throughout the house  and it would  not  work  br    br   i contacted conair  and based on its model number  which indicated it was well within warranty  they would replace it for free  sort of  i had to pay  15 in shipping to return it to them  i think that s totally bogus  given that the unit shouldn t have had any problems in that timeframe  hopeful  i sent it along  in about three weeks  they sent me another dryer  same model  br    br   having used the only other dated dryer i had in the house during that three weeks  i can firmly attest that all dryers are not created equally  i recall now why i i loved the predecessor of this dryer  and this one  before it became problematic  it s quieter  the temperature is more controllable  it s well vented and easily cleaned  also  the refinement attachments actually fit the former model  snugly  they fall off this one  the one from the deceased predecessor  and the one that came with this replacement  it s virtually no use to me without the attachments  br    br   but honestly  i am not motivated to rate it any higher  because i don t have faith this one will last  that it works well is only part of what makes a product great  longevity is part of the equation  as well i am not motivated to rate it any higher  because i don t have faith this one will last  that it works well is only part of what makes a product great  longevity is part of the equation  as well  good power  light weight  nice long cord  only drawback is cool shot button is sensitive and in awkward place  otherwise great dryer   i am a woman of color and i have to say i am very  very impressed with this dryer   rarely can i just buy a product like this one that actually works on my hair  especially when i have to do it myself and i have a very nice grade of hair    it get really hot and actually drys the roots and straightens my hair   i wish i could say that for the numerous curling irons i ve bought   the one   34 con  34  i have is that if you are not proficient in drying your own hair with this type of dryer you can get burned and you should take your jewelry off  i suggest you get some kind of attachment to put on the dryer to assist in drying your hair  i received this a day ago and it works well  is quiet and my hair is still on my head     i really like the controls   it works like a charm  i don t like that high pitched whine that comes from some blow dryers  i had to rely on reviews here to feel comfortable enough to make this purchase  so i am returning the favor  br    br   this blow dryer is sturdy  substantial and quieter than any dryer i have owned previously  the price was reasonable and the shipping prompt  note it doesn t fold for travel  but that wasn t a factor for me  hair dryer works fine and  is powerful  however it is a bit loud and the retractable cord is a bit difficult to use at first  i have had this dryer for about a year now and it has held up great  has great power and is hot enough   i have medium length   thick hair just past my shoulders and my hair will dry completely with this dryer in 7 minutes   my only complaint is that the plug is really loose to the wall so i have to plug it into an adapter i have otherwise it will literally fall out of the wall plug   also it is very short cord even when pulled out all of the way   sometimes when trying to retract the cord it gets stuck and wont go in all of the way so i have to keep pulling it in and out to try to get it to reel up all the way   when it does this it makes me just want to wrap the cord around the dryer negating the whole idea of the reel   overall its been a good dryer though and am glad i have it and it was a good price  this dryer is good enough  although the switch that controls the power of the wind feels a bit unstable  the wind power is just perfect  and the price is really reasonable  i ve had many good hair dryers and this one might be the best  lightweight  powerful and it makes my hair so smooth  this was a replacement to my old one which i had for a very long time  the old dryer was dropped too many times that the plastic cover around the power plug was exposed   my husband didn t want me to continue to use it for fear of being electrocuted because of exposed wires   dryer was still working though   the new one works just fine  i will be taking this with me when we go to u  k  looks good easy to install fast ship like the fact you can take off vent and clean when its time also cord has not tangled this is the best hair dryer by far   it dries my hair perfect without it burning my hair or getting too hot   the vendor delivered the product in perfect condition and in a timely manner   i couldn t ask for anything more   i am definitely going to buy a second one for my mother as a christmas present  i have only used it once but it was quiet  didn t feel too hot or blow too forcefully  i still had to use a curling iron briefly to curl short hair which slipped through  dried hair in good time  i have a bob   i liked the reviews it got and was from japan  took  a while to figure out some pictures which were not explained on the english page  i am happy with it  no issues with light  some people mentioned it died    been working ok for almost a month now  br   does the job and does it quite well   quite powerful and dries hair well   now for the price its great  the reason i bought this particular one was because i used it at a hotel and liked the product   br   now the reason for 3 stars  br   the quality of the stand and the plastic itself are quite inferior  feel like it gonna crank in about 3 months  the first one i had received had a mold defect and there was a huge dent in the middle so i returned it and got another piece from amazon  easy  and free  return i should say    but the fact that its quite plastic ey and the second one i received had the same dent  just smaller  so the finishing is not that great    but i should add it works and does what it should efficiently  i think i would give it 5 stars if it was  5 more expensive but was better quality finishing   my main complaint about this product is its strong plastic odor   i ve let it air out for days and it still smells    it s a good product  and it is very quiet compared to other hair dryers   i ve own it several weeks now and the plastic components still really smell  i got this for an overseas trip after searching through dozens and dozens of reviews of travel hairdryers   that come with diffusers   for my curly hair  i figured  why drop much   on this if they all are mediocre   and indeed i am glad i did not spend much on this one   it does have strong airflow for such a tiny dryer  which is great for non curly purposes   but the diffuser does not slow down the air flow very much  and on top of that  the diffuser is so tiny    no more than 3 inches in diameter   the low setting does not generate quite enough heat  but the high setting has too much air flow  i end up switching between low and high to build up some more heat  and only stick the diffuser into the roots of my hair so it doesn t totally blow out all the curls  br    br   so if you are picky about drying your curly hair with a diffuser  this probably isn t the travel dryer for you   if you just want to give your curly hair a head start on air drying because you will be somewhere cold  it s probably fine for that purpose   might be ok if you have very strong tight curls that don t get blown out as easily   or maybe you can get crafty and block some of the holes in the diffuser    br    br   the dryer did overheat a few times when using it on 220v with an adapter in europe  but i think as long as you are conscious about not using it on high setting for too long  it should be ok  i always wanted one of those hair dryers like in a hotel  now i have my own  conveniently hung at the side of  my sink  plenty of power for drying hair  easy installation  i got this a while back and its still working just like new  i love it  i wish the cord was longer but its pretty great and still living strong  i thought it was a bunch of nonsense when i read this hair dryer did all these awesome things to your hair  but it actually reduces frizz  i m not sure if all hair dryers do this or if it s just this hair dryer  but whenever i use it i notice my hair is a lot smoother and easier to brush through  i ve had it for 2 years and no problems  definitely would buy again  as far as i know so far this thing is better than anything my wife has tried before  she loves it  i ll be under there forever and when i get out my hair is still not dry  maybe it s my hair but i m nor 100  satisfied  have been using now for 2 weeks  good quality  blows plenty  of hot air  the cord winds well into the dryer this item was exactly as described and the price was great   i would definitely recommend it and purchase this item again  it has useful function to me  good product at an affordable price i do not regret buying it  like it  love it i love it because it s like a package  with a zipping bag  it s small and light and easy for me to carry around  this was my second of this hair dryer because i accidentally left my first one behind at a hotel  i love all of the features especially the cool button for that last blast to set my style  my hair is wavy curly and i love the diffuser  my hair always looks good when i use this dryer  this is my second dryer  the first one broke in half   i used duct tape to make it useable until i received the new one  the motor continued to work well  br   i ordered the same model hoping i could use the same wall mounting   but no  they had redesigned slightly and just enough that we had to remove the first mounting and replace it   i like the convenience  but i would really like to see them redesign it with a few more features   keep it compact  wall mounted  but add a cool function and make it quieter                    it is very loud  even though they advertise differently   i would recommend it as is  but would love those additional features  was concerned about purple color  but it is not bad  it is a darker purple that looks more regal than gouche  the blow dryer itself is powerful and effective  good buy  great hair dryer   i use it when on the road or at the gym   i like the powerful yet quiet air blast it emits  when compared to a previously owned conair that died    this is definitely an improvement and i recommend this effective product  works perfectly to dry my curls without frizz   in half the time of my old hairdryer   perfect size and weight for me   love the bright red color too  this is a great product for the price  it was very easy to put together too  i would order it again  i purchased the hair dryer to use in england   it performed quite well   it s very light and i look forward to using in future travels in the us and abroad  not very travel friendly   i was hoping that it would fold up   it doesn t   it works great as a back up to my normal hair dryer  i researched a lot of hair dryers before finally deciding on this one  my priorities for a dryer is to not be too loud  and to dry my hair fast  i have thick long hair  and it can take 10 15 mins to get my hair completely dried  my old conair dryer was working ok  but it was very loud and was taking a lot time to dry  aesthetically  this dryer is very cute  it is quite large  but i love the texture and the pink accents  some people had said it was a bit heavy  it is heavier than my conair  but not too much where i feel like i have trouble holding it  it comes with 2 attachments  a diffuser and a concentrated air nozzle  i use the concentrated air nozzle every day  it is easy to attach and easy to come off  the best thing about this dryer is that it is not very loud at all  and yes  it does dry my hair a lot quicker  with the help of the concentrated nozzle and a round brush  i can get my hair dry within 5 10 minutes  this is a huge improvement  it comes in 3 settings with 3 levels of heat  as well as a cold air button  the back of the dryer is easy to twist off for you to clean  overall  i am very pleased with this dryer  remington also has a 4 year warranty  which is very comforting  very high quality product   it arrived very quickly and was in excellent shape when received   god daughter really enjoyed getting it and uses it constantly  i had this dryer for a about four months until the motor fan began to spark and i decided it was no longer safe to use  prior to this however  it worked wonderfully  shame it broke  the unit does the job of drying hair just fine  but would be easier to use if the dryer hood height was adjustable  installed this a few months ago   super convenient and looks good too   i love the night light feature as much as the hair dryer itself   power is good with 2 watt settings   iconic dryer does dry hair faster   it was a little hard to get to the tiny screws in the back to get to the faceplate to attach to the wall  but it is sturdy   i love the design and function   i want to put one of these in the guest bathroom too  this product is awesome   mount it in your bathroom on the wall and no hassle finding and using it  br   we have now bought 4 of these  3 for our home and one as a gift to a house guest who loved it   br   highly recommend  so  we bought this dryer as a replacement for my wife s old  loud unit  br    br   unboxed it  and it felt nice and solidly built  and it was about mid range  volume wise  also a good selection of heat and fan speed adjustments  but  the first morning of use  it ran for about 3 4 minutes  then the breaker plug began to buzz loudly  and emit smoke  br    br   all use was discontinued  and was returned for a refund  br    br   i award it 2 stars for it being a potentially good unit  but subtract 3 for failing  this seems like a fluke  as most of the reviews are positive  but i m going to be searching for a different dryer anyway  i ve used it only a couple times  i like it  it gets the job done  had no problems with packaging or delivery  it arrived fast    works great  and the cord winds up into the handle at the touch of a button  plus the handle folds down so it takes up less space when it s put away  solves my pet peeve about hair dryers  i wouldn t use anything else  so i bought an extra one just in case they stop selling these  heaven forbid   this is a great product   perfect size and very powerful and dual voltage   i would recommend it highly  it would make a great travel gift  i recently purchased this hairdryer after my previous one started to sound like a dying cat and was extremely hot to touch after use   after a week and a half i love this new one     i greatly enjoy that i can dry my hair on cool and high  with the temperature choices of cool  med and hot  as well as low and high speed settings  and cool shot to set   it s light weight and efficient   i d buy it again easily  i love this blow dryer  it straightens and softens your hair instantly leaving it with no damage   i use it every day  works great   does what it is supposed to do and is compact and easy to use with good features too i m a hairdresser i have try different brands this the best so far  the price is right n the brand is good  got it  exactly as advertised  prompt services  recommended  br   perfect for everybody in the family  just a handy gadget    br    br    thank you very much  my daughters aren t strong enough to hold my hair dryer with one hand  this is cute  lightweight  feels like a toy but is a real hair dryer that will dry your hair  wonderful  very light weight and worked fine for my hair which is mid length   easy to switch voltage which i did before going to italy  i did use it on high and had no issues so did not experience what some others posted   you will need just an adapter  this very good for that price i thought it was a little bigger but is fine for me  bye and thank you for the product  i m not that impressed  i didn t notice a difference in the time it took to dry my hair  and it s heavier than my old dryer  however i did notice that my hair does look smoother  even though heavier than my other travel dryer  this one worked well on my last trip  i like the ion technology  it does seem to eliminate a lot of the frizzies  i also like that it has three settings for blowing  since my hair is fine  the lower setting is perfect for the round brush  the retractable cord made is easy to travel with  very easy to install br   works great and the led light is great  br   it looks very neat on the wall  br   the different settings are perfect  this is the best hairdryer i have ever purchased and used  i feel like i am in a salon every time i blow dry my hair  it is definitely salon quality  totally worth the money  it dries my hair well and quickly  br   i would definitely recommend it to a friend  i love it  not sure it s a professional grade dryer  but i have trouble working with the heavier ones so this is perfect for me  br   also  the price is right  love my blow dryer   it dries my hair asap  good dryer  recommend  works well in all levels  love the attachments  i had purchased one for my wife to replace another brand that had quit after two years  she loved it and it does a great job drying hair  br    br   i have added another one on my side of the bathroom so we don t have to share  you ll love the fact that it is so small hanging on the wall and out of the way  ready to use at anytime without have to untangle cords or put it away  it becomes part of your bathroom accessories  love it  love this hairdryer   i had no idea that there was such a big difference in hairdryers  but let me tell you  there is   i had a ceramic heated conair hairdryer   while visiting family  i had to borrow a hairdryer because i forgot to pack mine   the way my hair looked when it was dry was amazing   it looked so smooth and shiny   not the norm when using my conair   i looked at the name brand and took note right away   so glad i was able to purchase on amazon  we purchased two dryers and love them  my wife was in a chicago hotel where she them  after she got home we decided to order this dryer  this a great dryer for the price  we would recommend the andis dryer to others  this hairdryer is amazing  it is fast  efficient  and doesn t dry outta hair  i m very happy with this purchase and would recommend this product to a friend  we saw this in our hotel room and decided to purchase one for home and it worked out great for the guest bathroom  blow drying my hair is by far my least favorite activity everyday so i like to get a powerful blow dryer that can help speed up the process    this one is great  i strongly suggest to anyone looking for one with power  i use this everyday and absolutely love it  nice color  light weight and love the retraction cord  awesome blow dryer i love this hair dryer  it has amazing power  yet is drying my hair very gently  my hair feels smooth after drying it which is a huge improvement compared to my previous hair dryer  a great budget hairdryer and its also pink  that in itself is enough to love  glad i got this product and it shipped fast  who knew there could be such a big difference in hair dryers   well it s true   this hair dryer is so powerful  it dries my hair much quicker than other models   i love it  this little dryer fits the bill perfectly   it is one great addition to our bath room   don t know why we didn t get one sooner there are four thickmaned  long haired females in our household and this hair dryer has been fantastic in tackling drying and styling  it s also surprisingly quiet which is a bonus for early  5am  hair prep  when our other hairdryer goes up in smoke  i m going to get a additional conair  there s really nothing bad to say about this blow dryer  it s great for the price  and the compact feature comes in handy if you travel a lot  i purchased this hairdryer by a recommendation from my hair stylist   he suggested it would work perfectly for my naturally curly hair when i decide to blow it out straight   this dryer works extremely well and helps cut down the drying time without frying my hair   it s definitely worth the money  beyond my expectations   i have had vidal sasoon dryers  for many years   they were reliable and very good  i will continue their products  the hair dryer works well  i purchased it based on the 5 star reviews it had received from the few reviewers available at the time  light weight    various heat settings    positive and negative ion adjustments    etc  my only disappointment is the price  i ve tried better or comparable professional hair dryers that are about  20 less expensive  i thought this dryer would be better than those  given the price and excellent reviews  it isn t  oh well  still keeping it  rationalization  it s a perfectly good dryer  i have the wall mounted turbo  and decided to purchase one for our new camper   i do prefer the wall mounted one but didn t want to mount in a camper  i bought this hair dryer about four years ago and it s been great  i m really fussy about the air flow  most dryers don t seem to push enough air through to satisfy me  but this one is perfect  it drys quickly  and the heat settings are perfect  the only problem i ve faced is about 6 months ago the product starts to make high pitched screaming squealing noises  and they are loud  i like to dry my hair upside down  and i can t anymore because the dryer is especially noisy  i believe the fan unit has come lose and shakes around in the barrel which leads to the screeching   besides that  it s lasted a long time  and it s a great product at a price you can t beat  after 4 years my current one is probably unsafe to use  so i am ordering my second one soon  this dryer is really great and simple to use  nothing fancy but def gets the job done  i luv the color and has a hook on the bottom to hang    i originally rated this a 4 star but am now changing it to a 1 star because this dryer broke quickly   i would re done the review sooner but didn t think of it   don t waste your money     i have very curly hair  and the finger diffuser is perfect for dryer my hair without messing up my curls  i would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality hair dryer that works for all hair types  bought this for my boyfriends dad for his birthday   he loved it  the cord retracts great  and it works great   its not to big  and great to take with you on the go   plus it gets the job done  i purchased this hair dryer to replace a chi dryer  one almost twice as expensive as this one  that was none too impressive and had broken on me twice in a year   i was somewhat skeptical of spending even  80 on a dryer as my last adventure had not been very successful   however  this dryer does not disappoint   it s reasonably light weight  powerful and easy to grip for self done blow outs   i will say  it s not particularly quiet  but i am a consumer level user so i could really care less how much noise it makes   all in all  it s a solid purchase  highly recommended  love love love  it seriouskl y dried my hair half the time made it feel silky smooth its quiet compared to my drug store ones  omg it s awesome  buy it exactly what i wanted  very small and very powerful  perfect for travel  amazon should make it easier to go back in and order another  no option for that on your confirmation site after you get the product  i got this blow dryer on christmas of 2011  after a good year and two months of use it started making a shrill sound and started squeaking  i ignored it thinking maybe something was what could i do about it  but then after that in the 3rd month of year two  15 months  i started sparking the coils turned bright red and literally shot fire through it at my head  this brand is supposedly a good brand but i disagree  a blow dryer should last longer than 15 months  especially one that was used maybe a total of one week a month  i would steer clear here if you don t want to light your hair on fire i went thru chemo and my new hair is frizzy so i needed a special dryer and the onei mk is it  it worked beautifully in calming the frizzes and finally being able to style my hair  this ceramic  ionic blow dryer is great   it has awesome power and dries my thick hair very quick  its the only one its size that has a retractable cord  i love its size  performance  this one seems to work great  however  i do think the level of the wind is a little bit wired  nothing special here   just a very basic hair dryer   i like the color and the cord  but not the drying power  love it   works fabulous  not too hot and does everything it says it will   i m no hair pro and only use it for my 4 year old daughter but it works great for us     also love the small size for storage and the retractable cord rocks  this dryer is very compact  and has good power for a little dryer   i purchased it for my travel bag and used it for the first time this weekend   i was very impressed with how hot it got  how small it was  how well it worked  and how fast it cooled after using it   i would highly recommend  there is a big difference in my hair using an ionic ceramic dryer  i would give this one 5 stars except for 1 thing  a blue light goes on when using the ions  shouldn t be a big deal   however  it s right in your eyes as you dry  i use this blow dryer daily  it works for me  that way i won t have to borrow my daughters on  a good price as well  i purchased this to replace a 14 year old conair sufferering from heating element failure   the old i got for its claim that it was quiet  to use near my sound sensitive husband and hoped that this would be the same   it is and more   it does not claim to be quiet but it is   it is delightfully light to hold too   the 6 setting options work well   i am more than satisfied  i now hope for a long lasting relationship  the blow dryer works great  so far i have had no issues with it  the retractable cord is convenient  it al o is not as noisy as some other blow dryers  aside from being a bit heavy  i love this dryer  to be fair  i had been working with an ancient blow dryer that didn t have ceramic or tourmaline heating plates so of course this would work far better  and i ve been using the argon oil that came with it which is a dimethicone based product    of course my hair would be silkier than when i use my homemade aloe   grape seed oil concoction  so whether its the dryer  the products or the combination  i m not sure  but in either case i am happy with the results each and every time   i ve used it 4 or 5 times by now   this is a great hairdryer for the money  it s light weight and has a cleanable filter which should extend the life of the dryer  i like the folding handle  saves space   expected to be smaller but since it folds  br   the hairdryer is a good quality and dries my thick hair pretty fast and gives a br   silkier texture  i absolutely love this dryer  it was very easy to assemble and gets extra hot  i would definitely purchase from this company again in the future and would recommend anyone who is in search of a good quality hair dryer to give this one a try  the number of heat and airflow settings are exactly what i need   the purple color is beautiful  br   it uses toggle switch  instead of sliding switch  control and is very easy to change modes   airflow is adequate in high setting   i expect this to last 2   3 years  based on my experience with conair hair dryers   always wanted one of these and this one is great quality so far  my hair is so straight and tangle free  so much easier than using a comb and dryer with both hands  the hair dryer died on us after using it for a month  all style but no substance with this product  the slide switch almost came off and will not work  no air for my hair  the only thing that worked well on this dryer was the night light  br   not recommended unless you want to throw money away  light  powerful  plug a little big  but over all a great buy  and easy to use  easy to pack  does it s job  the hair dryer is very nice  just one drawback for me  as the standard voltage is 100v  in north american  i do no dare to use other level than set  i bought this dryer just because it was my favorite color  it turns out that it also is a wonderful dryer  i love it  lots of power and quiet   quiet enough to use on my puppy who no longer is frightened of being dried after his bath  we receided this product  at the garden hotel  in perfect conditio ok it was ok i will recommend to may relatives and friends i really enjoy this hair dryer  i needed it to straighten my unruly beard  i don t just it everyday but its loud fast and efficient  i was looking for something nice but quiet  this isn t bad   doesn t have the high pitched sound some of them have   though it s still a hair dryer so quiet is relative  both attachments are easy to use and overall very happy with this dryer  especially for the price  the temperature and speed is just right   it doesn t dry out my hair   i would highly recommend this hair dryer i was expecting this blow dryer to be hot really hot but it s not  i don t know maybe is just me br   that thinks that way  it gets the job done so i shouldn t be complaining  this dryer is wonderful  the power you have is second to none     a little heavy but worth it for the results it leaves  i am very happy  this one is good and gentle on the hair  however i have not used many so cant really compare  br   this one is nice and cheaper on amazon so go for it  i have been getting this dryer for 5 yrs each  time i get it i love it more   i have now got my sisters using it  i have limited strength in my hands and therefore needed the smallest and lightest weight hair dryer i could find and this fit the bill   the main brands seem to no longer carry one this small  so really had to hunt for this one   the low speed seems more like a medium speed which i liked  i purchased this to replace my old conair folding handle dryer  that one was a bit more compact  which i liked  but this one isn t bulky and works really well  i appreciate the ability to control both the temperature and speed of the air  i would definitely recommend it  great dryer but the first one lasted a couple of months  the second died after about 5 blow drys  so listen to the other reviews  i didn t and now i have to buy another dryer  update  tried a third  it died after 3 or so blow drys  clearly defective model  it can t handle it s own heat  i am very happy with the dryer so far  it fits in the limited space i have in my salon  i love the way the controls work and i was very surprised how much heat it generates  i am very pleased that it works on a 110 plug as opposed to a 220  i do feel that this is one thing you need to add in the description of this item  i almost did not purchase it because i did not know this piece of information  excellent item  already bought one  not too big  good power  good handling  wonderfull on the wall  very good item  very recommanded  makes a good dryer for my daughter to take to college with her     would recommend it again and would buy again  this is my third yellow bird   i keep one as a spare just in case    air flow and heat are superior to any product  including the conair family  that i ve ever used   i ve bought them for both daughters  who will also continue to use them as long as they are produced  this dryer dries hair fast with various heat options and speed   the retractable cord is very convenient   i bought this dryer after i used a similar dryer in a hampton inn hotel and loved it  i am surprised at the complaints about this dryer   i have used it for a year with no problems and i still love the dryer  i came across this hair dryer at a hyatt hotel and i was impressed with how quick it dryes my hair  i have lots of thick hair  leaving it looking shinny  this is the best blow dryer ever  gets super hot i was using the chi deep brilliance dryer for my dominican blowouts which was good but this twin turbo cuts my blowouts to half the time and gets far more straighter with just the blow dryer  you ve got my vote  drys hair quick  a little bulky but worth it   the other reviews were worth reading for this item  thank you it was great when it worked  but it went completely dead without any warnings in less than 12 months   so that speaks so much about its quality  this is a great hair dryer for the price  and was sent out and delivered to my house ultra fast  i like this hair dryer  it comes with a defuser which i love  also it has a cooler setting which lets me style without the heat  the price is great and the dryer is top quality  the best l have ever used   can see and feel the difference in the way my hair styles after drying   not too heavy and the controls are placed conveniently to enhance changing the temp and air velocity   reasonably priced and with amazon prime     no tax and free 2 day shipping    hard to go wrong  extremely loud   the concept of the side usage is fantastic and that is what i am searching for   this product is just too loud  i like this hair dryer but the hot setting on it is beyond hot  it s brain boiling   use with extreme caution  my old blow dryer was really bad  so i looked up to read a lot of reviews  this one had quite good reviews  and i m quite satisfied with this purchase     i really really like this product  it does a great dryer my hair  i definitely get a salon quality finish with it   br    br   however  this is the second yellowbird i ve bought in 2 years  both of these stopped generating hot air within 9 10 months  just blows cold air  it s the oddest thing  good product  relatively light weight and dry faster  i love the metallic look purple  i found it s better to use warm temp i o hot temp  my hair become less fuzz and more shine and smooth  i absolutely love this hair dryer  i have long curly hair that i blow out every other day and this hair dryer has been perfect for that  the one downside is that it only lasts about 2 years  i just ordered my fourth   but that s actually pretty awesome considering the price  and it s so small that i can take it with me whenever i have to travel for work  rather than risk whatever the hotel might have  i definitely recommend this dryer  i can set my hair and fall asleep while drying with this hair dryer  it s everything i was looking for and more  perfect for get sets and tight curls  my wife remembers her teenage days when this was all the rave    now she uses it after shampooing and is extremely happy    she swears this was the best product for the job and at a great price    if you want to get something for the missus   this is it  you can t go wrong this is the best hair dryer i ve ever owned  it dries my hair in 5 minutes compared to the 20  minutes it use to take me  i have very long hair   the only reason i gave it 4 stars is due to the location of the settings button on the handle  when holding the hair dryer it is easy to acidentally change the settings but you get use to it   overall great hair dryer     so fast and lightweight i love it even my hairdressing blow dryer was slower than this one    i am glad it blew up   love love love this product liked it   the cord is definitely shorter than normal  liked it because i feel it dries well but not at the expense of my hearing  my daughter has enjoyed using the hair dryer  she wanted a blow dryer that could handle her thick hair  and this one does  excellent performance and quality  heavier than many other dryers  but with a solid feel and excellent fan performance   i like it more than other dryers i have used  used at the beach in the hotel  loved it  am going to buy one soon  thank you barb  dont have to spend a lot of money  my elchim hair dryer is a very powerful product that helps me style my hair with ease  it has many settings and temperatures  i highly recommend this item to laymen and professional stylists  very easy to install and works very well  better than expected  the only reason i didn t give it 5 stars was because it is a little noisier that i would like   br   but its great  the old hair dryer that my wife and i used was old and started giving off a burnt electrical smell  while i was online ordering another product from amazon  i decided to give the hair dryers a quick look  after looking at several  i chose this one because of its features and low price  i must say that we are quite pleased  this blow dryer is great for traveling   the fold up handle allows for easy packing   the cord retractor is great but somewhat noisy   this is a big improvement over my 15 year old conair with a higher volume of air pushed out   works like a hair dryer should with a compact form  i ordered this from amazon and got it really fast  br   i used it today  and it made my hair nice and smooth  br   it s seems nicer than i thought it would be for  20 00 my previous conair had more power  i really don t see how this is 1875 however it dries my hair just fine excellent hair dryer   bought this t3 featherweight journey travel dryer at amazon com with  zadro next generation lighted travel mirror   12 inch brown faux crocodile pattern 4 extendable trays doctor style makeup bag   so looking forward to my next trip     thanks amazon  i like it so much  i bought two  for two separate bathroom  it is good for the price you pay  i like this hair dryer very much  it hangs on the wall so one does not have to get it out and plug it in  it also has a nice nightlight built in and that s handy in a dark bathroom  i received my conair hair dryer and i love it  i had many other conair dryer s in the past and i find this one is a sure bet  those flexible ones just don t do the trick for me anymore  i like that it s sturdy and it blows really well  i bought this hair dryer because of the price  it dries my hair nicely  it claims to have ion technology but i think it is a gimmick  my hair dries frizzy with this hair dryer like it did with my previous one that was old and didn t have ion technology  used this at a hyatt resort in ca   i immediately bought one through amazon on the stop   works great ad is compact  i love this nice looking hair dryer   it s powerful  yet sized perfectly for home use   i highly recommend this product  great dryer causing less frizz and easy to use  relatively lightweight with two good setting  a minute or two on high followed by brief low and shoulder length hair looks fab  i would have preferred to have an in between setting but am adjusting to the high speed low speed  it is very light weight and small which will work great for traveling  great product  lives up to its name  it is compact  lightweight  plenty of power   i would recommend it to anyone that travels with a hairdryer  my other ionic hair dryer just quite  so took a chance on this brand and not sorry what so ever   fairly quiet and love the optional speeds and temp s that my other one didn t have  was recommended by my hair stylist and i love it  i have thick curly hair and needs a hair dryer that can handle that in a jiffy     found what i was looking for  thanks  i bought this to replace the exact same model we had for the past 6 years  my wife had dropped our last one for the last time  it didn t stop working  but had so many cracks and was so loose  i was working she would electrocute herself sooner or later  br    br   anyway  we she liked it so much  we bought the same model  i like this kind of hairdrier  it leaves my hair a little frizzy but it is light and easy to handle  i purchased this hair dryer for it s ionic qualities   i live in an extremely dry and often windy climate  and my hair tends to get fly away very quickly   after using this hair dryer only once  i noticed a great improvement in that my hair was no longer as fly away as before   the dryer has great features  and does the job extremely well  none available  andis hair dryer is very good product   protects your hair  the hair dryer is very neat  and it gas a long cord  i love it   also  very good price   i  recommend it  nice  i had one of these hairdryers for several years and had to get another when the old one quit   easy to use  i have owned an older version of this sunbeam hair dryer that worked well for many years    i m thinking at least 10   unfortunately  this model was purchased just several months ago and already the on switch will not always catch   i have to keep pushing it or the off button to get it to work  often i find  also  that the red reset switch was triggered   i haven t yet contacted the company  but hope very much that they or sunbeam will make a complimentary replacement   if so  i will write a new review   if not  never again will i buy a sunbeam  br    br   new review   the company from which i bought this hair dryer stands behind their product   i have been sent a replacement as well as prepaid postage to return the original   i am very pleased with this company s customer service   i do hope that this sunbeam product is free from defects   a wall mounted hair dryer can certainly be convenient  it works so nice and does not take up much space  we love it  the tow speed also is really nice i love my hair dryer   i was only looking because my mom needs a new hair dryer   i saw a few negative reviews about the quality   so since mine is pretty old  i can t vouch for the current quality standards of this product   i ve been super lucky with mine   it gets daily use if not more  i always wished it had additional heat settings but using the cool burst has worked well for be  my cord has never frayed as others reported  but many times the last few inches of cord don t retract  i keep it clear of lint and i think that is a huge saver on its useful life   i hope everyone has the excellent experience i have had   everytime i look at a revlon or conair hair dryer  i cringe  i ve never had one of those last more than a year  after 10 years  i would purchase this product again  but mine just doesn t want to die just yet  excellent product     it heats up super fast and is lightweight for easy use   this dryer would ve cost me a fortune at a local beauty supply place  my  160 blow dryer burned out on vacation   i really could not afford to spend that kind of money again  but i have curly hair so having a good blower to straighten out my hair is important   this one was cheaper  but i had never heard of the brand before so i was hesitant  but after researching and reading the reviews  i figured i would go for it   all i can say is i love it   it s quiet  it s light  it has alot of heat settings  the buttons are positioned well  and it works better than my old blow dryer as far as straightening my hair   my boyfriend who also uses it  even commented on how much he likes it  and he is one picky kind of guy  excellent the product br   the goods came complete with all accessories in very good condition  br   the dryer works great and is equal to the image that is published this hair dryer is powerful and does s great and quick job of drying my hair after a shower  the price was right and it was shipped quickly by amazon  br   it is an excellent value for the money  conair use to be a great product  and due to the fact of personal use over thirty years of different hair dryers  i purchased this model  the folding andel  and retractable cord were attractive to me  but the dryer did not last a year  i used it every morning for three to five minutes  but everything now a days is built cheap  and doesen t last  same with this model  great size for travel  or small storage  but don t expect it to last  i bought 2 fhi heat nano salon pro 2000 w  nano fuzeion   one was a gift   i used mine and it s great   i have dry frizzy hair and it s the first dryer i ve ever owned that made my hair straight  soft and shiny with little effort   my daughter thought i used a straightener  i highly recommend it   it s well worth the cost  i wanted a hairdryer with decent power air output  that was fairly quiet  at a decent  consumer  price  i was tired of other weak hairdryers that didn t have enough air output  and found this one had the power to dry my thick hair  the finish is a nice rubberized maroon color that looked good too  it s pretty easy to hold  smaller in size and weight  and has a long cord  the lint screen on the back is easy to access too  which is often what causes a hairdryer to lose its air flow  so that s super handy   i actually purchased a second one of these online  the first one broke  my fault  after i slammed it on the counter oops  s  after wal mart stopped carrying them so i m a happy customer reviewer  and i m pretty picky  this is a good dryer  i gave it 4 stars because it doesn t get as hot as i would like it to  but that s just a personaly thing  definitely gets hot enough for your hair  i wanted this style hair dryer which is very hard to find in stores  this one fit the bill perfectly  have only used it twice but appears to work fine and was exactly what was advertised  so far i am very please and happy with this product  i m in love with this dryer   my hair usually takes 45 mins to dry and with my new dryer it takes me 30  it is very comfortable and with all the space inside the air gets through quickly having your hair dry pretty fast  i would totally recommend this to everyone  it s at a good price also  great hairdryer with twin fans  does make a scary screeching sound if the power drops  the hair dryer is not red  it is pink  also it does not have ionic drying which is a good thing in my case  i love this product because it does a great job at drying hair with multiple drying settings  but mainly it is great in that it is not bulky like most hair dryers  it folds in half  has a retractable cord  and is fairly light  this is second time i ve bought this dryer  after first one servced me well   it s powerful but not loud with that annoying whiney sound they usually make   i love the recoil of cord   happy happy  for second time      i wanted a smaller hairdryer to take with me while traveling and this is perfect  i couldn t believe how small it is when folded up  only reason i haven t given it 5 stars is because i haven t used it yet but for travel purposes  it s well worth the money  i took one hair drier from my country  but it doesn t work because of  different voltages  br    br   so i had to buy a new one  then  i select it   i got it in two days  it is so fast  br    br   it is perfect   this is a great hair dryer  and not just because it keeps the chord inside    many hair dryers get super hot even on meduim heat  this has a very soft medium heat  and is hot enough    and i am not sure what all makes it work so well  but it dries hair fast  i got this hairdryer for my daughter and after seeing the results had to get one for myself   i have very curly hair that is always frizzy in summer so matter what products you use   this is the only hairdryer that seems able to dry my hair  in hundred plus degree summer heat and humidity  and keep away the frizz   best investment every  first the price is really good  i ve used it frequently several months and it works well  a little loud but just as most dryers kept looking at different ones and finally decided on this one  i have hair i blow straight everyday so i need something that will last and so far no complaints on this one  good output and a nice weight  i bought this model for the retractable cord and folding handle   after using it 2 3 times week for the last 2 1 2 months  the cord has frayed in one place and it has stopped retracting   on the plus side  it was an effective hair dryer  but there are several that work as well  i had one like this for about 8 years  even though it still works i figured i should retire it as an extra or back up  i searched everywhere and bought several new hair dryers but none compare to my old one  i googled the serial number of my old one and with awesome luck i found the exact same hair dryer that i loved for all those years  thank you amazon for the quick delivery and the great product  design is ugly  cord to electic outlet is great lenght  heat settings are fine  setting for blowing are fine br   the curly cord from the unit to handle is way to short   will not reach more than 2 1 2 feet br   hard to reach mirror and dryer is handing on wall only 1 inch from the mirror i like this dryer  compared to its price  it s worthy and both simple and useful  the shape and its power are impressive  this compact hair dryer works very well and gets hot quickly getting the job done   the diffuser was too tiny fro my long hair  would buy again  excellent    a                it works perfect and is very hot to dry hair   excellent article  very low price and ussesfull  thanks after buying cheap  but high watt  dryers for years  i am a convert  this has cut my drying time in half  i bought this for the diffuser for traveling   the air flow is so strong that it doesn t really diffuse very well and my hair ends up being blown all over   if you just want a compact dryer for traveling this would be fine  while this is bigger than the very small dryer it replaced  it is a light weight at the other  drys hair in minutes  and overall is exactly what i wanted   i read most of the reviews of this dryer and others before ordering   i know conair products are good and a good value   i m satisfied with this purchase in every way  this is a professional hair dryer that works with hair stylist is better than ever i guess   because i didn t hear any complaint or comments from my wife so far  she needed a new one  so i surprised her with this one  she absolutely loves it  its the only thing she uses  my husband and i used this dryer at the ritz carlton naples   we liked it so much that we ordered four   two for home and two for the gym  i have curly  coarse hair   this hair dryer allows me to have straight hair and maintain the natural volume in my hair   i ordered two  just so that i would never be without it   love this product  works great drys hair fast like the long cord should of purchased this dryer a long time ago  had many other hair dryers this one is the best for the money  packed easily in my one carry on bag for flight to ma   was strong enough to blow dry my hair straight just as my larger home dryer does    might have taken a few more minutes but perfectly satisfactory    it will work when i fly to europe also  which is very helpful   seems as reliable as my previous conairs  have always liked this brand  this is the second one i have had   the old one finally gave up after many years of use   it is the right size for me and not too many features to confuse me but enough to do the job   and nicely   i think i ll purchase another one to keep in my rv  this is my second one in 8 years and i think it is great  this new one is for a new home  this is the noisiest hairdryer i have ever used  apart from waking anyone who might have been sleeping  it was headache inducing  it operates well and looks good but the noise factor was unbearable  i am not a whinger and am pretty easy to please but this was not worth keeping and was returned  this dries my hair very well  and doesn t cause any frizz  i have naturally thick  long  curly hair  so whenever i decide to straighten my hair  i need to ensure that it dries halfway straightened  i use a flat iron after i am done drying   the concentrator does an amazing job straightening my curls while leaving my hair without frizz and fly away hair  i also use one n  only argan oil to help control frizz   i use the diffuser whenever i want to dry my curls  and i love the way my hair turns out after a few minutes of drying  br    br   this purchase was definitely worth it  it does exactly what its supposed to  perfectly dries your hair in no time  br   fast and furious  no frizz love it you don t need a flat iron after using that tool  it looks nice and its really affordable    glad that i got it  this was the first time i spent  more than  40 for a hair dryer  so i was expecting it to be great  but after about a month the attachment nozzle kept following off  however the dryer works well  it is still aggravating for the nozzle to fly off while drying my hair  i should have returned it  too much money for an okay hair dryer  hair dryer was amazing until it started to struggle and make sounds after 2 months of use and completely stopped   broke at 6 months  contacting the company direct for a replacement since amazon could not help  br    br    135 is too much to pay for a hair dryer that lasts 6 months     even if it was amazing when it worked  my wife likes it very much  it s better than the last one she has that got too hot  br   thanks  br   jim this is the only dryer i use  i love the force and power it has  if you want volume this is the way to go it does what it is supposed to do  and reasonably priced  i don t see any difference from my old dryer though  dries hair fast enough  has three heat settings and 3 speeds  wow  she is awesome woman say that it doesn t take long to dry there hair  i need to order one more for my daughter  this is a great product  the instructions are very clear and it was super easy to put up  def  recommend  the perfect dryer for travelers   i owned a earlier version of this compact dryer from the mid 90s until 2013   used it everyday   extremely powerful for its size   would still be running if i hadn t plugged it into 220 volt outlet in europe before flipping the switch from 110 to 220 volts  i have never owned an professional hairdryer  mine are usually fairly cheap  under  25   that  being said  this is the best i have seen in it s price range  the attachments fit without being whipped across the room for no reason like my others and it dries hair twice as fast as my previous  i don t have as many split ends either  for durability it has held up fairly well being used at least once daily by a complete klutz who drops things  never any damage  cracking  or peeling  it is also quite pretty  some say it is heavy in the reviews  while i was used to a lighter one  i only noticed a weight difference the first few times before it seemed normal to me  the only issue i have had with it is that my long hair will sometimes get sucked in the back  i have learned to keep it held higher  and since it is slightly heavier than my last i guess i get a light work out while doing so  lol  overall a very good hair dryer and i would recommend  this hair dryer was loud and cheaply made  i returned it  the fan was rattling and very loud  i would not recommend  small hair dryer  perfect to put on you travel bag and use anywhere  works perfectly  i recommend this product to anyone i was happy with my new dryer but totally burnt after a month use  lucikly we have not any injuries    bought it when my other one broke  love it  i recommend everyone to use this product regardless of the hair type you have  used this dryer in hotel and liked it so much that i searched online and found it at great price on amazon   dryer is compact  dries hair fast and heat setting is not too hot   you have option of mounting on wall bracket or not   i use as home dryer and also take with me for travel   great little dryer and prefer over many other name brand hair dryers i have purchased in the past  this is my second one  had the first one for many years and now replacing it with new one  was so glad they were still available as my family loves this blow dryer  it is so handy and ready to go when ever we need to use it  love   i dry my hair almost every day as my hair is rather long  this little beauty does its job  and does it well  there are plenty of settings and options to choose from  depending on what you want and what is best for your hair  i have no complaints whatsoever  br    br   update  it s been several months now  and i still use this product almost every day  and it still works great  this is easily the best hairdryer i ve ever purchased   strong  fast  and definitely good quality  i really like the hangup dryers because they save counter space  i don t like this as much as the  last one i had  when it stopped working i threw it away before writing down the manufacturer so i couldn t reorder it   but i m sure i ll get used to it  it s heavier than my previous dryer  and i d really like a setting that s between low and high  temperature wise  fairly easy to attach to the wall  although the template wasn t of much use  i love that the cord is kept inside the hair dryer   no more tangled cord  glad i bought hair dryer  this blow dryer is light weight  easy to use and quiet   i love it and it s a great buy for the money  my last one burnt out after 3 years of use  hope this one will last longer  it works very well especially when 3 people use it daily  this is not as good as the hair dryer i use at home  a conair 225np comfort touch tourmaline ceramic 1875 watt hair dryer  for compact  portable  it is not that small  for use as a regular hair dryer  it takes awhile to dry  and just hi lo heat and volume  my previous portable one was smaller and dried better  this works ok  these are great our other got used so much   it finally quit  reason 3 girls enough said  so go buy one  the dryer does its job well and despite its large size is fairly easy to handle   speaking of the handle  it stays cool  as does the rest of the casing   it is a bit noisier than i thought it would be but it has a deeper sound than our previous dryer    which kind of whined  just what i was looking for  had one almost identical but fried it in iceland  shopped all the locals and could not find this really small size  bought one with a folding handle thinking that would make it workable but not so  found this one on amazon and it is the perfect replacement  blows like a fool and is small enough to pack  i bought this blow dryer to replace another one that i bought online  the previous was not powerful enough   i really like the cord feature but it can hurt you if you aren t careful  it retracts very quickly  overall  i love the blow dryer and am happy with my purchase  i love andis products  they all tend do a great job heating up quickly and drying and straightening your hair  br   also  their flat irons are great as well  my daughter just loves this small hair dryer   however  it is advertised on amazon having 1200 watts   i have a kill a watt s meter to test the house wattage  and this hair dryer reads 981 watts on high and 255 watts on low setting   however  it works great and saves some energy  i have had the blow drier for almost a year   i love it   i shut the bathroom door because the light is a little bright however it is great for those middle of the night potty breaks   it works great for me and i use it every day  one thing that i dont like however it could be because i dont know what i am doing   every time i go to use it i have to click the switch on the mount   it does not automaticallyclick on when i pull it off then push the on on  i have to always click the switch  this blow dryer works great for me  i am african american with natural course hair  it has the perfect amount of heat to my hair to straighten just enough so i don t have to use a straightener  but  when i do put heat to my hair after using this blow dryer it lays down so beautifully  i highly recommend this  i bought this hair dryer because it was small and lightweight   it also was touted as saying it worked on dual voltage for traveling   i tried it in the u  s  to make sure it worked   the first time i used it in the u k   after switching the voltage  it got very hot and stopped working   so disappointing  i only rated it one star because the color was nice  it s a good hair dryer  works great on all settings also a great price can t go wrong for the money  believe it or not  i actually bought this to replace an 1875w dryer by revlon that was at least 10 years old  i was used to having a button for heat and a button for speed of fan  i see only the one button and it has heat and speed together  i think  there is a cool shot button too  guess i could read the direction booklet if i did not throw it away  either way  i like the dryer  it has a trip button on the outlet plug that is a safety feature that helped once on the old one when a thunderstorm went by and i was using the dryer   a good feature  the dryer is lightweight  a little larger than i thought it would be  very easy to place on the wall  i would recommend this item  i never want heat  br   i just want cool air blowing hard  br   but this dryer will not blow cool air on high speed  br   it blows cool air softly just fine  br   but  if you turn up the speed  then you get hot air  br   so  for me  this dryer gets 1 star  br   but  for the other people in my house who want hot air  it gets 5 stars  br   so  i am settling on 3 stars  love it love it love it   the hair dryer with attachment works great and dries my hair fast   buying one for my sister the first conair i ever owned lasted me almost 22 years  so i definitely wanted another conair and was willing to give the infinity 223xr a try  i loved the  cord keeper  idea and the power provided by this model  but after going through two of them in a three year period  i cannot recommend them  normally i wouldn t write a review  but this is the second conair infinity 223xr model i ve owned that has exhibited identical problems  the cord stops retracting properly after a few uses and then the dryer one day simply ceases to function  the first one i purchased lasted almost 2 years before it stopped working  because i take good care of my appliances and they tend to last a long time  i thought i had simply gotten a lemon  it happens to the best products every now and then  unfortunately  the second one did not perform any better and stopped working after only 7 months  the problem doesn t appear to be motor or fan related  rather  my husband suspects an electrical issue with either the cord or the plug  regardless  i am done with this model  this product is geat pushes air fast and hot  three speeds to suit everyones needs  light weight  not too bulky  best blow drier i have ever used  dries hair fast i was hoping that this revlon drier was a great bargain  and that its price of  12 wasn t an indication of a cheap or shoddy product   when it arrived  i was chagrined   it was a very light  very cheap feeling product  which also only had two possible heat settings   all in all  a very unimpressive hair dryer  i guess sometimes you do get what you paid for  after the first exact same model stopped working after 18 months  i bought another since my wife liked the style  when the new one came  it fit the bracket exactly as the first   the only difference is that the new one is noisier than the first one   not sure why  but it is annoying  especially in the morning  this is my 2nd  one  my first one broke where the hair dryer hooks into the mount  i would make that area stronger  i love this dryer  my old remington was amazing so i knew i wanted to stick w  the same brand  its amazing  works great and the color is the best part  plus it feels like velvet   this is a good product   i ve been using it for a month   it installed well and is easy to use   i knew when i bought it that it only had high heat and low heat settings  but i ve been surprised by how much i ve missed having a cool air only option   if they had a version with that feature  i would give it five stars  this hair dryer is great  i have very thick hair and it dries my hair quickly  very nice   good price too  i m very happy with the hair dryer   i like a wall mount hair dryer so it is constantly out and available out and yet off the bathroom vanity   i ve had this for a while and have no complaints   i didn t buy it for the nightlight but it s still working after being plugged in for 24 hours a day for awhile  this blow dryer works great  my hair looks really shiny after using and soft  the blow dryer is a little heavy  i would buy again  you can choose hot  warm  or cold air in high or low airflow  the long cord allows you to move freely  my hair is very thick and curly  i used to to blow dry my hair as straight as i possibly could  and it did a fine job of achieving the results i wanted  it s sturdy and i love the attachments  i like simple  lightweight and efficient and this was perfect   like the lighter heat option for finer hair like mine  this works very well   fits nicely in my hand   good for travel and   or  as your main hair dryer  although ferrari is a car s brand it s been known for some decades specially because of the design it s cars offer and now they applied it to the hairdrier  br    br   it s said to have a professional quality and it does  the item works amazingly well and looks very beautiful so as you ll when using it  br    br   the hook on its base makes it easy to keep the cable together after the use  the unit is very compact and travel is quite easy as well  ihave 3 indoor cats and only one of them likes this bed   but the one who does loves it   i bought two and the other goes mostly unused   will saved it for a spare for the one who loes it  br    br   the hair dryer that hangs is good   i love that it hangs out of the way including the little piece to keep the cord up  i bought it mostly to keep it out of the way of my grandson but like that it cuts down on clutter   the high speed is good and dries well and is pretty quiet   the low speed is very  very low and not much good for anything but final dry of bangs or ends   i have fine  thin hair so it works ok for me but i doubt it would do the trick for someone with thick hair   i usually dry my hair with the high speed until it is mostly dry and then use the low to style it  have a small bathroom and use it a lot outside of my house  great for travel  wish it had an intermediate setting  only low and high   it dries my hair with speed and leaves it with shine   it is fairly compact and quieter than most dryers  found it to feel heavy and the buttons change speed and temp easily while drying hair  does dry hair quickly is it s good feature this is a nice hair dryer that does the job quick and well   i didn t know what a ionic ceramic hair dryer was when i bought it  but it really does dry my hair quicker than my last hair dryer   and it really does leave it fuller and shinier   i wouldn t have believed it if i hadn t experienced it myself  but i ve been very pleased with the results  br    br   as mentioned elsewhere  the switch button design makes it a little difficult to adjust the settings as you re drying   but the chosen settings do stay in place once set  and the design of the sliding switches does make the handle easy and comfortable to grip   so there is both good and bad points with this sliding switch design  br    br   finally  the three heat and two speed settings give me more options than my last hair dryer did  which is very nice  br    br   all in all  i m happy with this purchase   it s a good hair dryer that gets the job done  very lightweight  easy to use   exactly what i needed   the attachments and travel case were an added plus   perfect for people who need power plus a lightweight design  this product was easy to mount on the wall and works perfectly   the temperature settings are easy to select and change  good deal for the price  could use increase in blower speed  like the ability to change heat setting  would recommend  it was delivered within a few days and i really like it   it was really nice to be able to hang the cord and get it off my counter  my old hair dryer was a conair 1875 that i purchased about 10 yrs ago and still works but started to make noises  so i figured it was time to look for a new hair dryer  i purchased this conair 22np comfort touch tourmaline ceramic 1875 and it is even better than my old one  it s light and comfortable to hold while styling and drying my hair  it dries my hair in 1 2 the time of my old one and my hair looks a lot better  i would recommend this hair dryer to anyone who is looking for a new hair dryer  it s a great product and you won t be disappointed  this is an exact replacement for our old one  makes it easy to replace  our small bathroom has no place on the vanity or drawer for it  wallmount makes it handy  clip that holds handle broke  but dryer still worked  this is a great hair dryer   very professional results  several heat and speed settings   really worth the amount spent   thank you  love it  excellent product  very good power as i expected since it is a professional product   i hope lasts forever as if used in a salon it is wonderful  i have spent a lot more on my other hair dryers and this one is great  it is small  lightweight  and dries my hair in less time  i will recommend it to others and would buy it again  this is a solid hair dryer  the settings are sufficient  and it will blow your hair dry fast  i use it on my short hair  and it dry and voluminous in less than a minute  my wife uses it to do her long  think  asian hair  and she is very satisfied  no complaints about this dandy little device   update on july 2015 after 2 and 1 2 year using about 2 times a week  it started to break last month and we re getting a burnt smell sometimes  while in using  the power would go on and off  it s a good price to start with  i think we got good value out of it  awesome product  pretty much as described  does exactly what it s supposed to do  if you want a good ceramic product  then this is it for you  compared with its value  i liked the small size and almost cheap and high quality  br   overall i am sure all products japanese great this product  love that i don t have to worry about cord  quick free delivery through prime account  would recommend to others  love this powerful dryer   it s pretty heavy duty  and it s a little heavier in weight than any other dryer i ve had   but it has the cool setting medium heat and high fast dry mode   pretty loud  but what hair dryer isn t it   it smoothes the hair too   removing the frizz   combine with correct hairbrush and you will have salon results  not only am i happy with this hairdryer  but i ve already had a houseguest that is coveting it after using it  it has great power  is small enough to consider taking it when i travel  and was really reasonably priced  i hate to admit it  but it s better than the  150 italian hairdryer that i was replacing  small  cheap and works well for what it is  don t expect the power from a full size dryer but this works great as a mini dryer for traveling  love it  very powerful for something that small  wish it could fold up  but still it is an awesome product  i really like this conair hairdryer   i ve had it for several months and use it most every day   it s easy to use  dries my hair quickly and i like that i can set the temperature and speed separately and that the cord retracts  i was really impressed with this andis 80405 lightweight ceramic ionic blow dryer  my hair was more straighter than i thought it would be  i  also love the comb attachment  this hair dryer is pretty good for the price  i previously had a conair ceramic hair dryer with a retractable cord  it did a good job  but was heavy  and ultimately it was the retractable cord that caused the dryer to stop working  the conair 256p is nice and light  i have curly hair and do not dry it completely  so i put the heat on the warm setting and the blower on high and it works great for me  it doesn t come with a diffuser  but i don t use one  it does however come with the vent attachment so you can direct the air flow  my son uses the dryer as well and likes it  the only complaint i would have is that it is noisy  basically  it s light and does a great job and the price is right  works great    better than advertised  i would have recomended this product to others and it works like a dream on my daughters hair too  i was very pleasantly surprised by this hair dryer  i am not willing to spend  50 or more on a fancy hair dryer  so i hoped this one would be close enough  it works great   better than expected  dries fast and gets plenty hot  it comes with several attachments which fit securely and don t fall off  also love the miles long cord so i can stand anywhere in the bathroom while drying my hair  i bought this after my last conair blow dryer pooped out  br    br   pro  dries quickly  silky  smooth hair br   con  none yet i have really thick hair that needs a lot of heat to dry and be styled  i was pretty disappointed right away by the  hot  setting   didn t feel very hot to me  the only time the air actually felt hot  rather than warm  was when i turned the setting up to  high    and then i had to work so fast to dry my hair that if i made a mistake  i would have to wet my hair and start over again  the  high  setting is no joke  it really moves the air  but i can t use it every day or else i d look like i just walked out of a wind tunnel  br    br   also  i didn t find the switches very easy to use  especially if my hands were even a little damp   was hard to get a good grip  maybe i m just a weakling    i much prefer switches that actually protrude from the handle that can be flipped with your thumb  if that makes sense  br    br   anyway  it s not totally useless  i just had some issues with it  i will say the concentrator and diffuser attachments are great  but with the heat speed settings  just not a good match for me  we re in the health care industry  often times after our patients undergo mri and other brain imaging procedures  they need to shampoo their hair  this product is just right  works fast  i recently bought this onei mk l air ionque hair dryer and it s the best ever   it arrived so fast to my door and i use it on my shampooed  hair and it dries fast and my hair is not dried out like my other hair dryer    my hair actualy feels like silk  very smooth     i would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends  br    br   thank you   br   linda br   ri this was to be a replacement for a sunbeam dryer we had in our home which is now working  surprise   we arenow  thinking of putting it in our vacation condo   these dryers are absolutely excellent and we will buy another as a backup in case you all stop manufacturing them   highly recommend this product  nice size  convenient for travel  powerfull and light  dual voltage is very beneficial if you travel to europe  very happy with the purchase  this dryer  has good  strong air flow and is conveniently small for traveling   it is a good bargain for the price and i would recommend it  a great dryer for me  i have arthritis   not heavy and does all i need for  drying and styling my hair  bargain priced too  i enjoy using this product   dries long hair very fast   i have no problem recommending this product to a friend  we were concerned to begin with because of a post about weight but found that this was in fact the perfect size for us  it seems to be well built  our issue with a different brand had been that the cord would break where the cord met the handle and it seems as though this one the cord is a little more protected  we will see how it holds up over time but as of right now i m very hopeful  i like the dryer  good quality  but heavy  can recommend the product  was delivered faster then expected  usps delivry guy did not ring the bell  just drop the dryer next the door i really ordered this for the price and color   i was very surprised to realize how hot it gets  br   i never use the highest heat setting  i don t think i could stand it  br   this dryer gets hot and very rapidly  i don t feel the need to go above the medium setting  br   don t want to trip a circuit or melt it   pretty powerful  the blow dryer came before expect so thats great  everything was great br   my only complaint is  i have thick hair so im scared i might break the combs br    br   great product this is a great hair dryer  it is quiet and has a powerful fan blower   it has 3 settings each for heat and blower speed  br   there is also an instant cool button to cool down the air no matter what heat setting it is on   it has a long cord which br   is nice   it is a litlle larger in size than some and somewhat heavier  however  the heat and blower features and quietness br   more than offset this  my daughter in law recommended this blow dryer  so i purchased it   it dries my hair in half the time than my other blow dryer   it s light weight and easy to use  yet powerful  i really very much liked this hair dryer while it lasted  which was about 6 months   if i had written the review earlier  i d have given it 5 stars   but  suddenly  the high speed fan stopped working  the low speed works  but it s hotter than it was  which scares me a little    it gets such great reviews  both on amazon and consumer reports   but why did it die so soon   my previous cheep hair dryers have always lasted for years   now the best amazon can offer is approx  50  refund if i send it back since the 30 day return policy is past  i liked the concept of this portable hair dryer so i purchased it before a trip  i m not sure why  and i could have ended up with a faulty model  but it broke after being used three times  the plastic near the handle broke and got sucked up into the motor  rendering it unusable  i love this   it s just what i wanted when i decided to buy a blowdryer   fast shipping  too   good buy  fabulous little blow dryer  small  compact  great for packing and travel but still has plenty of power to get the job done quickly   worth the money  seems sturdy like it will go the distance  a bit on the heavy side but very well made   wide range of heat and blower settings   works great   when was the last time that you bought an electrical appliance for under  30 that had a four year warranty    i ordered this conair hair dryer back in june of 2012   i have had many conair hair dryers over the years and have always been very happy with them   i would get many years of use out of them before they finally succumbed   when my previous hair dryer died i again wanted a conair since i had good luck with them so i ordered this one   i loved this dryer all the way up until today   while drying my hair it just died after about 5 minutes of use   my hair is not long  just below my shoulder  and usually takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to completely dry depending on time of year   i thought that maybe i just blew the alci so i followed the operating instructions to try and reset it   no luck   so i let it sit for a couple of hours to then try again    still no luck   it is dead   again  i have had other conair hair dryers that lasted for many years with no problems  br   so because this particular dryer only lasting just under 13 months i am giving it the one star   i haven t given up on conair   i will continue to buy conair hoping my next one will last longer  i bought this to replace and supplement a 1980s version of these compact hairdryers after trying one that advertised as   34 compact  34  but really only featured a folding handle that was prone to folding while in use  this one is the nice true compact type i like   it also has decent quality of wire  some of that cheap wire nowadays hardly bends   and the cord is a generous 6 feet  the long cord is also a big selling point since a lot of the newer dryers have 4 foot cords   i cannot comment on the international power settings since this will probably only be used in north america   it does have 2 separate blowing speeds  the high speed is good  but my older dryer is just a little more powerful   however  this one is good enough and the controls are set up for easy one handed usage  with high  then   34 off  34  then   34 low  34  all on one simple power button  my hands are arthritic and this is much easier button placement than having the buttons on the front of the handle   also has a hanging loop as shown in the photo and i will be using that rather than folding the cord up after each use to store it   overall  this feels like a high quality product and over the past month or so i have used it  has been excellent   i would buy it again  and no stupid folding handle to try and get   34 compact  34  rating  i had no problems with this  it works  the diffuser was what i really wanted  the concentrator i haven t tried  and that works too  i bought this specifically to work on repairing my inflatable kayak   heat the fabric when patching   works fine   good value for the    this dryer is easy to hold and has alot of power and force   i have thick hair and it dries my hair very quickly   a great buy  i have really long hair so i go through blow dryers like there is no tomorrow   this one so far has lasted over 6months for me which i think is great    it does have a funny way of turning it on  but once you figure that out you are good to go  i have a revlon 1875 which i have had for years and love it   i wanted something similar to stay at our trailer and to be used at weekends   this fits the bill exactly   low price and does the job perfectly   i would recommend this to anyone  this dryer is compact but heavier than i thought it would be  i like the way it folds  the retractable cord makes packing easy  the dyer is fast  a stylist recommended this to me as it is the model they use   it is lightweight  compared to what i had been using  is super powerful and does my hair faster  love this dryer have been using the same kind for several years  lots of power for straight hair and low is also great for curly hair  i read reviews on this that said the night light was too bright   i don t agree at all  besides  i would not recommend ever leaving a blow dryer plugged in all the time   it s a great little dryer   no more having to keep in a drawer  taking it out  putting it back  every time i want to use it   it was a snap to put together and get on the wall  this blowdryer has great wind power and delivers a lot of heat   both make it great at styling my very curly hair   it is a reasonable weight and fits comfortably in my small hands  which makes maneuvering it easy   i only wish it came with a diffuser attachment  i love the size  power   settings  also  the browdryer has a really nice look   is powerful too  i feel it gets hot enough on the hottest setting  medium heat on the medium setting   low heat on the low setting  i also like the cool air button too  i m black with relaxed african american hair and it works just fine for me  2000 watts makes a big difference in how quick n easy straightening your hair is  perfect for coarser hair types  i have fine   thick hair and this product has cut down 50  of drying time   it is a great product for anyone who has limited luxury time to spare  just received the elchim professional 2001 2000 watt classic hair dryer and am very pleased with product  dryer is quiet and hair dried much quicker than before  br   would highly recommend      i liked it for performance and hot cold options  the different speed options are also good but its so big  not convenient for travel or to carry around it has no heat selection  only settings of high or low for air flow   high almost burns my scalp   low works but is slower   must open vent at top to make it tolerable on either setting  the bonnet tore after three uses so that air flow was impeded   after the tear  the air would not flow to the top of the bonnet   i could not find a replacement bonnet when i searched online  this dryer is powerful but light weight and easy to handle   the diffuser is large and the settings make styling easy  this is not the best hair dryer that i wanted but its still does its job  cute  handy and affordable  nice work i pretty love it  low price and good function  not loudly  and i recommend you to buy it and you will not regret  this blow dryer is compact  so it is very easy to travel with  it has a lot of power and dries my hair very fast  it is also very cute  my wife was trying different brands of blow dryers for years  she was not impressed at all  till our hair stylist receommended elchim professional and my wife noticed the difference right away  she is very pleased  one of the greatest features is the retractable cord   no more having to try to wrap cord for travel  dryer is better than most hotel dryers   it is a little heavy for a travel dryer   however  i feel that the trade off for speed of drying is well worth it  i ve been using this hair dryer for quite some time and have never been happier   wall mount keeps counters clear and i love the small size and light weight   thanks very much v r susan two year old dryer quit  exploded inside unit with a bright orange fireball  cord was melted at handle  returned to authorised service centre  andis sent replacement free of charge  they make good on their five year warranty  now there s another warranty with this new one  br    br   hopefully i shan t experience that type of inconvenience  or mind you  danger again  noticed before dryer s demise   cord was hot to the touch  br    br   used the   asin b0009xh6tg andis rc 2 ionic 1875w ceramic hair dryer with folding handle and retractable cord   whilst awaiting replacement  noticed it didn t have the heating capabilities as the 75370 has  glad to have it back  easy to use  easy to handle  easy to hang up when done  works very well  fairly loud but not obnoxious   seems very well made  i love it  dries hair so fast  very nice condition  great i can remove filter and clean it  i think this will keep it working efficiently for longer  i like that this hair drier is quiet  it has multiple heat settiing with a good high heat setting   it is comfortable fit for my hand and not heavy which makes blow drying less toil some  although not heavy it does not lack in quality and durability   i have owned several dryers and refused to setlle for a poor quality  this is superior in quality performance and durability compared to the typical conair brands i have owned for several months now and have no complaints and works as well as the day i purchased  if looking for quite and quality i would recommend remington   well worth it  i love this hair dryer  if you have straight  no volume hair  this hair dryer is perfect  it gives me the only volume my hair will ever see  i have two houses and have one of these in each  my first one lasted me 4 years before i took it to europe and all of the added voltage was too much  i highly recommend  bought this to replace an old sunbeam that burned out  looks exactly like the sunbeam one and even used same mounting plate already on the wall  nice   this is the second one of this model dryer  revlon travel 1875w i have purchased  i bought this one for my mother because she was dying for it since i got it and it worked so well  i bought mine in 2009 and it is still going strong  i have pretty thick long hair  about chest length  and this dryer is by far the best one i ve ever had  i always bought conair in the past but saw this on sale and decided to get it to travel with  it ended up replacing my full size dryer because it works better than my big conair  dries my hair super fast  5 minutes or so  and is really light  i dry my hair almost everyday in the winter and only a couple times a week in the summer to give you an idea of how much i use it and it still works like a charm  revlon for me from now on  br    br   summary  best little hair dryer you will buy  powerful  light  and great value  the product is ok  and does the job  but compared to other infinity hair dryers by conair  this one isnt as powerful and thus takes longer to dry the hair  i do love the fact that it has a retractable cord  love the nite lite and the heat settings  but after having it now for almost a year the motor is starting to make a noise    it stops  working every now and then  i would order this again if it burns out  lightweight and effective   i d give five stars if the cord was retractable or had some easier mechanism to keep it tidy  but as a hair dryer it is a great deal for the price   thanks conair  my hair gets caught and yanked if i get the dryer to close to my head  also  it weighs too much  low air on the first but the 2nd was great  it is in the guest bath so know one evr has to pack the monster blow dryer  the dryer works well for the price  but unfortunately after only a few weeks of use  the button that controls whether the dryer is on off and the speed came off  i took the dryer apart and set an interior switch to the   34 high  34  position so that whenever i plug the dryer in it will turn on at the high speed  i m not sure if that s safe  but it allows me to continue using the dryer  since the dryer was so cheap when i bought it  under eight dollars   it s not such a big deal  so i give it three stars  e ereally worth the money paid i m happy with the product a must buy my top list loved it wow fully trust in the brand and the model powerful and good i first used this brand of dryer at  barona casino hotel  it worked so good i ordered one as soon as i arrived home  i thought it would be really expensive but it is not  does it s job  temperature settings are awesome  you won t regret buying it  i havent tried in any of the extra style dryer  i love sitting under the dryer and being able to read or do handwork and getting my hair dried hands free  i do wish it had 3 settings instead of just the two  it is either hot or cold and i would love to have medium as it does get quite hot but i love being able to do something with my hands rather than holding the dryer  i have had one since 1998 and loved the size and ease of use mounted on the wall  so when it started acting up and i needed to replace it    i was not sure if i would be able to find a replacement that i liked as much   but this one was perfect     i didn t even need to remove the old wall mounting hardware  it connected right to my old hardware    very happy  love this hair dryer   my hair is silky smooth using this   the multiple heat settings are really  helpful and it dries my long fine hair very quickly   plus it is a great design   super happy  not crazy about the diffuser  which is what i bought it for   i have wavy hair and this doesn t really work for my hair   it leaves it looking limp and seems like it takes longer to dry my hair than my old hair dryer   it is lightweight   maybe it works better for straightening  worked great              better then my other ones and i had a lot of them ranging from 10  100    this one is the best so far   it takes some time to get your hair dry  depending on how many rollers you use and your hair type  but it definitely gets the job done  it is sturdy and hot enough without burning you to a crisp  this is a great product for home as well as hotel  i have one in each of my 3 bathrooms   i have frizzy and curly hair so it is hard to find a blow dryer than can straighten easily and quickly  this pro blow dryer definitely does the trick  it is strong and gets the job done  good and powerful  i think it is enough for boys and guys to dry their hair within 2 or 3 minutes  great price  it s a good brand  i did my research and its easy to control because of the different heatsettings  i recommend   others brands are expensive when you could just get this product for less  the greatest thing this dryer has is the retractable cord   and  of course the varied choices for temperature and blowing power  compact size  powerful dryer  light weight  super cute hello kitty and pink  dries my hair quickly  i highly recommend this product  i originally came onto amazon to search for  a dryer that i had found in a store that was out of stock   once logging on  i decided to peruse the selection of hair dryers in the same price range   this dryer had the largest number of reviews and the highest rating   i was replacing an old dryer and was looking for something that would dry my hair quickly and leave it looking smooth  br    br   other reviewers commented on how great the onei dryer was  citing it s speed in drying  it s ionic component that left hair smooth  and several even mentioned how quiet the dryer was   the dryer arrived faster than anticipated and i was in love the first time i used it    it did dry my hair quickly  the same or faster than other dryers   my hair doesn t require a pass through with a flat iron on most days as it usually did  and it s actually really quiet  like  abnormally so    while i don t have to worry about waking anyone up  it s quiet enough not to drown out the phone ringing or my music playing while i get ready  br    br   the attachments are great   as is the long cord   i really love this product and hope it lasts as long as other reviewers said it did  i got this hairdryer because it was cheaper but still had great reviews  i would agree with some of the reviews in that there is not a very good medium heat  its either too hot or cool  but i still think it works great  i love it  this is a truly fast dryer  it met or exceed my expectations  i have had it for about 6 months and love it  this replaced a conair wallmount dryer without the led night light  br   found the andis model to be compact especially with the unique cord hanger  br   does not seem as powerful however  br   bright night light a real plus  this dryer is powerful enough it just produces luke warm air   it was very convenient to install as clippped right on to the existing sunbeam plate bracket  i loved my new hair dryer   it way 2cute    it looks like a cute toy but works pretty good   i think it is pretty powerful  it dries up my hair extensions good    really love this hair dryer   it is super lightweight and sleek   dries hair quickly and easily   the price was on target and the shipping was ultra fast    very pleased with the seller as well  highly recommend product and seller  kudos to both    i bought one of these in 2001 for a 3 week trip to europe   it s still going strong   so  i purchased this for a young friend  just graduating from high school and headed to spain for some future studies  hopefully  she will have as good luck with her s as i have had  it is convenient and one doesn t have to bend a stretch to locate it   it hangs on the wall and the night light is great  the styling of blow dryer is great  the functions are not  the cool down button feature was pressed once for use  but got stuck inside of unit wobbling around  but would not release back so the warm mode  the 240 v option only worked on the low feature  also  i found the brush attachment flimsy  not firm and would eventually wear out quickly  sub stand features ruined a great looking unit  quality would be the remedy  this could have been a winner   sad   this is the only hairdryer i ve ever seen that has a cool blower setting as well as a cool shot button  i like the cool blower for finishing when the day is hot  i keep pressing the cool shot button accidentally  however  because it s so darn convenient  the cool shot button is exactly where my thumb naturally rests and i have to keep that in mind  the cord is shorter than i d like  and a good bit shorter than my last dryer  the sliding controls aren t wonderful  the friction ridges are quite flat and the two slides mesh so well and are so narrow that my thumb can t tell them apart  i have to press those flat ridges so hard that it hurts my thumb  so i use my   34 off  34  hand to slide the controls  there s some kind of thin  plastic like finish that s slowly peeling off  but that doesn t bother me at all  br    br   my last dryer was a black   decker  it was very small and compact and did the job for many years  possibly as much as 20 years  i do still wish i could have replaced it with the same thing  br    br   all this sounds like complaining  i know  but they re trivial complaints  except the cord length   i ve never had a diffuser attachment before but i found it worth learning to use  i used to dry and style my short  curly hair in about a minute on the hot setting  but now the diffuser and the warm setting do it just as fast and better  the conair hot setting is pretty hot  so if you need that you ll be happy  best of all is that  even in the winter  my hair never gets flyaway with static electricity  br    br   i ve had this conair less than a year  so i can t comment on its durability  br    br   btw  i bought this upon the recommendation of consumer reports  they called it a good value and i certainly agree  br    br   i ve had it almost 4 years now and it s still trouble free  long and heavy duty cord  powerful  great attachments  enough settings and the buttons are a little recessed so you can t mistakenly hit them while you re drying   fees sturdy but not too heavy   good product for the buck  never heard of this brand before  but found it in a boutique hotel and was very pleased with so i ordered it from amazon   really reduces drying time which results in smoother hair   highly recommend  there aren t too many of the soft bonnet hairdryers available  so this is the one that i ve had the most success with  i just wish it were easier to get replacement bonnets  i recently ordered 3 for the dryer that i already had  but the bonnets have been on   34 back order  34  for months  so i had to buy a whole new dryer  i love this hair dryer   there are more settings on this dryer than i have ever had   it seems to dry my hair quicker so far  this is the first time i ve purchased the real pro with affordable price   it dry fast with impressive speed    love it its brand new  just as expected  works perfectly  it fits all of the descriptions of when i purchased this product  handy   convenient   love the cord hanger  i use it to hang my flat iron   very good product for the cost  this unit performs well and was easy to install   we especially like the magnet   34 latch  34  which holds the dryer into the wall mount   there are no plastic latch parts to break and you don t have to push the dryer into the mount to lock it into place  i bought this for traveling  i have very thick hair that takes a long time to dry  this blow dryer is light weight but still does a good job of drying my hair  i actually use this in the garage for drying glues  paints and finishes  replaced a unit i had for years  works great i bought thus dryer after using it at a hotel and decided i must have it   i love the way the handle folds for easy packing into my suitcase  the cool button is easy to reach and my hair does not get frizzy   did i mention the retractable cord  another feature that i love   i highly recommend this dryer  i have wavy hair that can be coaxed into curls or dried straight  this hairdryer works for both  and dries quickly whether for curly or for straight hair  the diffuser is wonderful  i can put my hair into it and my hair stays without blowing out of it  i get nice  voluminous curly hair  there is a wide range of  blower strength and heat available for this hairdryer  and for blowdrying straight  i need to use one notch below the maximum for both  otherwise  my hair blows everywhere  despite the blower strength  the hair dryer is pretty quiet and fairly light  the cord is nice and long  one last thing  i already knocked this hair dryer off my counter top  and it survived  seemingly without any problems  not using is regularly but its serving the worth of the price  its is small and easy for carrying during the travel  love it   lighter th an i thought a dryer could be   lives up to it s reputation   dries my  thick hair in record time hot but not too hot   lightweight   compact   only flaw  would like more focused air stream   otherwise   just right   hope it has a long life  i m traveling to europe and i need a hair dryer with diffuser  i really like it  is not heavy  easy to handle  is hot but you can change it to a low temperature  best part  voltage for us and europe  just love it  very cute  my wife love it she try it immediately on my daughter they love it  really worth your money try it  i bought this based on a recommendation from a freind  i think its a good haridryer  i have had no issues  my last one that just stopped working was considerably  more expensive than this one so just comparing the two this one comes out on top for sure  lots of air flow and a large handle thats comfortable in the hand  lightweight and compact but powerful   used one in a hotel and immediately ordered one when i returned home  after years of using a hair dryer  this is myall time favorite   i use it most every morning and love it   plus  it was reasonably priced  this is not a compact travel hair dryer  but for home use it s sleek  lightweight  and powerful  it has all the features anyone would need  and it s easy to handle  the dryer works efficiently and is easy to pack  the unit does not have the power of my older traveler hair dryer  but is more than adequate  br    br    i would buy this product again  this hair dryer is light and easy to use   it met my expectations for drying medium length hair   very pleased  i love the ionic conditioning feature of this hairdryer  it works  other than that  it s pretty much your average hair dryer  i do keep accidentally turning it off because of the way the switch is located  but i expect i ll eventually adapt to that  my wife used this brand she saw at disney while on vacation last year  she liked it enough that she decided she wanted one like it  after searching amazon i was surprised to find it and order one  works well and wife is happy  seems to have a stronger air output than more expensive brands  i love this vidal sassoon dryer  do not be fooled by its size and   34 full size  34   it is super light and dries my long hair in minutes  it has 2 heat settings and a hot and warm mode for drying and setting respectively  it has the option to turn the ions on and off which helps in a good blow dry  it comes with the nozzle attachment for focussed drying and prevention of frizzies  it also comes with the curl enhancer which helps in creating voluminous natural waves  br    br   i was pleasantly surprised by how light it is and i manage to dry my hair with only one hand  while combing with the other hand  my dream hair dryer    great product   this hair dryer dries my hair quickly and gives me the smoothness that i want   i enjoy using this hair dryer because it gets the job done in less time   my hair is thick and it takes forever to dry but not with the andis 82005 professional 1875 watt ceramic ionic hair dryer   i bought this because i could not use my conair infiniti pro hot brush when i travel to other country  fortunately  this performs much better than the conair hot brush  aside from providing me a good styled hair  my hair also shines better after using this  this product is very durable  it shows on the design  i ve been using this regularly for three months now  the dryer is very quiet  gets hot quickly and has three levels of speed  but the fastest speed still seems a bit slower than other pro dryers  but i am happy with it and got a lifetime warranty for giving feedback to the site  we went out west traveling  i took this mini hair dryer  it worked great  it was small but it worked better than my full size one at home  it didn t take up much room  and it was light  would recommend this to anyone traveling   perfect  since switching to this hairdryer  my drying time is significantly less  it has good air power  without over heating your hair  plus the attachments are great since i like to switch between curly and straight  my wife is very happy with this purchase  i chose the product because the ad stated it was quiet  light powerful  professional quality  i have found everyting to be as advertised or better  hairblower is very quiet and light to hold  these were impotant factors in choosing this prduct  price was very reasonable  delivery was quick  product was received in pristine condition  i highly recommend this product and seller makes my hair shiny and soft   i love this flat iron   great deal compared to other quality flat irons   i would highly recommend to anyone  a hotel we recently stayed in had this hair dryer and i loved it so much  had to buy one when i got home  br   dries hair quickly and is nice and light too  the first two did not work and were replaced by amazon  the 3rd one worked for 14 months and then burned up   after turning on by itself in the middle of the night  luckily  we were home and unplugged it before it caught fire  like the fact it is so compact that it is not difficult for travel as it takes up little room  has a nice quiet sound and drys my hair very nicely   also the retractable cord it great so you don t have alot of cord that you have to wind up  this item also works well in a small drawer if being used at home  i felt this dryer was great for the money  it is not one of the best dryers out there but i felt it was sufficient in getting my hair dry in a short time period  i am not one of those folks who wants to wait very long for my hair to dry but i also didn t want to use a towel either  that s why i love this dryer  it is low cost which should be great for those people on a tight budget  this hair appliance works well   no issues to date   it came with two  2  attachments  both of which i use intermittently   it is lightweight and easy to handle   the button that changes the temperature of the drying air is in a bad spot and every now and then it is easy to switch the drying temperature   easy enough to change it back  but it should be in a different area  after reading all the reviews  it seemed as if this dryer would perform well for my hair type  i have thick  coarse  asian hair and a lot of it  this dryer is nothing special though  it s not that powerful  and nothing worth raving  br    br   pro  three heat settings  the fastest speed though is not that powerful  br    br   con  retractable feature makes the cord quite short  br    br   however  my roommate who has thin hair loves this hair dryer and is even considering getting her own  i ordered for this hair dryer because of the advantages i saw i have had a revlon dryer i had used for a long time and i guess i was due for a change  br   i really looked out for one very good and with very advanced settings i was able to get this dryer down to africa from the u s however on receiving infiniti conair dryer i was so anxious to use it like my custom has always been  i read the manual and was so suprised it was a 125volts i was so dissappointed   i have not been able to use the product since i received it  br   my question is how do i use the product since my country has a voltage of 220volts i would really love to  brought this to thailand  although there were blow dryers in the rooms  i always prefer to have one that is powerful enough to dry my hair quickly  this is awesome  compact and worked great  just make sure you read directions before using in a 220 v outlet  my hair is super thick and in the past when i used to blow dry it never came out soft and smooth like after the salon  it was always dry and frizzy  a beautician friend of mine recommended switching to a ceramic iononic conditioning hair dryer and recommended the brand hot tools  i had purchased a ridiculously over priced hot tools hair dryer and i figured you have to pay more for results  i no longer had dry frizzy hair after blow drying  it was silky  soft and smooth just like after the salon and i was overjoyed  several weeks ago my hot tools hair drier broke  i couldn t afford to replace it so i looked for a cheaper alternative  i found this dryer for more than 50 dollars cheaper than the one i was trying to replace and it had very similar specifications  so i took a chance and i ve never been happier  it does such a better job than the over priced professional hair dryer  my hair dries in nearly half the time  it s never been smoother or softer  br    br   the drier is much lighter than my old one and comfortably fits in my hand due to its ergonomic shape  it isn t very loud like most driers  instead of a high pitched whiny sound it s nice low whooshy sound  i always compared hair driers to sounding like a power drill    well this one doesn t sound like a power drill  it sounds like a device that blows air  like it should  the included attachments  concentrator and diffuser  are an added bonus  i ve used the concentrator with great success and i haven t used the diffuser yet  since i recently cut my hair very short and only use a diffuser for my natural waves when my hair is long   br    br   for the price the blow dryer definitely exceeds expectations  i m going to buy the other remington tstudio styling tools just based on my experience with the dryer  dryer is good if you have thick hair   dries your hair very quickly   it is a little heavier and larger in size than i prefer   i like the attachments that come with it as well   very well made and good cord quality  i had a little difficulty finding a surface to put it on that would match up with a seat that i had to be high enough up into the hood   if you re short like me  5 2  34    you can t just put in on the dining room table and use one of its chairs   it would be helpful if the advertizing text stated how high the top of the inside of the hood was from the surface on which the dryer rested  i really love this hair dryer  my old dryer died and i needed to get a new one quickly  i wanted one that was quiet and dry well  i have an onei flat iron that i m very happy with so i was happy to buy the hair dryer  i love the low volume of the hair dryer  love the ionic switch  and it really does dry well  i am happy with my purchase  i have very long  to my butt   fine  wavy hair  being dominican  i remember going to the salon every saturday morning since i was 10 with my mother so that we could pay 20 30 dollars for our lady to blow dry my hair  br    br   fast forward a few years  i m 30 now   i work full time  am married  and went back to school  so  i don t have time to go to the salon and sit there for hours until my hair gets blown out  br    br   thankfully  with my hair  all i have to do are rollers and sit under the dryer for 40 minutes and boom   no salon  nice waves  better than blown out  much cheaper than going to the salon  btw  br    br   i looove that the dryer has a timer  which means i don t have to watch the clock constantly  the dryer gets very hot  almost too hot  i used the highest setting   but that means i spent less time under the dryer  it s not very loud at all  which i also like  also  in order to adjust height in most dryers  one needs to turn some sort of knob  right  not with this one  i just push it down as low as i need or pull it up as high as i need  and i m done  some people may not be used to his  but it works for me  br    br   when i do rollers  i only use the jumbo extra large ones all around my head  even so  i m still able to fit under and inside  the bonnet  br    br   i took off one star b c it was a bit challenging putting it together  the materials seem a bit cheap  but overall  the dryer gets very hot  is not noisy  and makes it look like i went to the salon  br    br   good buy  great value  wife loves it as does my daughter  bought another one for her  br   fast drying with out the frizzzzz     light and easy to hold  br   great price  fast ship  great product  i was so tired of cheap hair dryers breaking and decided to purchase this dryer  i am very pleased with this hair dryer  it is much quieter than most dryers and dries hair quickly  i would recommend  my daughter had gotten an ionic hair dryer and told me how much she enjoyed it  so  though my hair is much shorter than hers  i decided to give it a try   i ordered the onei mk ll  a different brand than my daughters   i loved it the first time  i used it   i color my hair and it is on the thin side and this dryer tames the frizzies and adds body and shine  br   my daughter tried it when she came to visit and  of course  loved it   so  i bought her one  too   she claims that it is light  easy to handle  dries her hair quicker and over all  does a much better job than her old one  br   the delivery was prompt and product was in good condition   no problems  i bought this dryer because it came with a diffuser and i needed a dual voltage dryer for travel to europe  it folds down and is great for travel  it works well on both 110 and 220v  reviews of other dryers said that they only worked on high when using 220v  but this has both low and high on both voltages  the diffuser does a decent job of diffusing the air and dried my hair well without firzzing it  i only plan to use it for travel and only used it for 2 weeks overseas  so i can t vouch for its durability  at this time  though  i am very satisfied with it  i ve had this hairdryer for less than a year and its button functions  are not working anymore even though the hairdryer itself is in perfect condition  br   it is a shame that conair uses such cheap materials for their products  what can i say about hair dryer why do you insist on making people write long review about somthing when i say it was good isnt that enough now if it was 1 000 000 than that is different but it was not and i am done wether you like it or not by far the best hair dryer i have owned  i have very frizzy curly hair and this dryer definitely does its job  i can tell a huge difference after using it the first time  we hung this in our small bathroom   it s powerful for a small hairdryer   the night light is super bright  a little too bright  i was little skepital for spending  70 for a hair dryer  i thought there are no difference between  30 dryer and  70 dryer  this hair dryer is very quite  light weight  dry quick and well made  i got it for two weeks now so far so good  this is my third andis hangup pro turbo hair dryer of this model over the past 15 years or so  my husband and i use it on a daily basis and love the convenience of having it on the wall for easy access  product is very reliable  must keep dust screen in back of handheld unit clean  it is very easy to clean as it unscrews  wall mount has a reset button if unit shuts down due to overheating which doesn t usually occur if screen is kept clean  would purchase another of this product when needed  i use this hair dryer every day and i don t feel as if it s doing a   34 great  34  drying job   i previously had a revlon mini which worked just great   in any case  will continue to use this one until it dies  great blow dryer  but does not hold tight in the holder  but rather loosely   after using it just a short time the plastic piece that holds the hair dryer in place broke off  now it is disconnected and sitting in the basement not being used  i loved this travel dryer when i first used it   however this morning  i plugged it in ready to go and there was no response   i tried using several outlets in our house and got no action   my last hair dryer lasted 8 years without failing   this is very disappointing  i really loved this hair dryer for a long time  it worked just fine  and was a good price  br    br   then one day my mother in law got her hair caught in it  how does one do that  anyway   and now it only seems to work at half power  and can get really hot really easily   i suppose it would only be an expensive hair dryer  if any  which could take preventative measures in their system to more effectively deal with that sort of thing if it were to happen  br    br   even so i m satisfied with it and might buy a new one for myself  and pass off the old one to my mother in law  bought this hair dryer for my wife to replace her old one that was starting to physically wear out  this one dried her hair several minutes faster than the old one  even with hair dust cleaned out of the filter   highly recommend  the finish is a soft touch   satiny plastic paint   coating that feels good to hold in your hand  this is a a wonderful dryer  and it didn t cost an arm and a leg  why didn t i buy it earlier  after much heavy use by two people daily  my original remington ac2015 finally bit the dust   it lasted a good long time   i loved it so much i ordered the same one as a replacement   i didn t even see what else was out there  which i never do   i m the research queen   i figured why look for something else when this one has everything   it s quiet  has perfect temperatures and it dries fast   leaves my hair silky and shiny  it is a bit heavier than some but you get used to it quickly   feels solid and has a nice no slip texture plus an extra long cord   highly recommended  the dryer is quiet and powerful  there are three heat speed settings and one without heat  the dryer has silky touch surface for smooth handling  we have used andis hair dryers for years  they are used in upscale hotels  this is a great product   i didn t really believe all the ionic hype  but it really does seem to make a difference   my hair is smoother and softer and dries in much less time  i d say 30 40  faster    it is a very hot hair dryer  so be sure to keep it away from your scalp and face   but  i love it  excellent my clients love the way theirs hair look and so fare the best investment that i made this year the dryer is stylish and works well but is on the heavy side and takes some getting used to  overall a good purchase for the cost  i did a bit of research on the web to get a good price  this does look to be similar to the andes product with the same features  but the sunbeam hospitality is the dryer i have  i chose this based on 1 retractable cord  am using with the stowaway tray and wanted to be able to adjust the cord length so it didn t get caught in the cupbaord when closing  2  tourmaline 3  not too gigantic  br    br   this is much chunkier and larger than i anticipated from the photo  but not enough to annoy me   mainly becuase this is one of the fastest dryers i have ever used  seriously   and  added bonus  the sound is not obnoxiously high pitched  my hair is dry in like 4 minutes  with my older hair dryer s     usually after 10mins i stop drying and i have mostly dry hair    with this  i have it on for 4 5 mins and it is completely dry  love it  you should buy one  i got this for my daughter cause i have one and she loved it   it got here fast and in perfect condition   she loves it   loves the power  i was excited to get a   34 turbo  34  dryer  when i used it for the first time  i was disappointed with the pressure of air flow  i thought it would be more powerful  it is a good hair dryer but not the greatness  i was expecting  the style is fine  there are enough heat and power controls for my liking  it is too noisy when you go to the higher speeds  i am still keeping this and not using the higher speeds  this hair dryer is a bit heavy and large but has good power and i really like the retractable cord  this mini blow dryer is perfect for traveling  i used it with the diffuser attachment for my curly hair  and my hair dried faster than it does with my regular dryer at home  don t let the size fool you  it s small but high powered  i will never travel without this again  this is an excellent  compact  easily installed and easy to use dryer   this is the third of these units we have owned  i like some heat from a hair dryer   this one has a position that reads   34 hot  34  but  it falls short of that  i m assuming because of our litigious society and that someone might drink a blazing hot cup of mcdonald s coffee while using this hair dryer   the buttons on the interior of the handle take some getting used to as your grip may have a tendency to change the heat setting or turn it off   i m adjusting and am getting along with this hair dryer for the most part  love the dryer  a funny thing though  i have short hair and the attachment that fluff s up your hair  i have not mastered using it yet  i am afraid i will knock  myself out  my hairdresser and friends laugh at me when i tell them about it  otherwise  easy to handle and quick to dry  i m happy with this product  i have long thick hair that normally takes forever to dry  this makes it easier and faster to dry my hair  i m very satisfied with the andis dryer  this product got fast in a new not opened package with instructions and everything  it is usefull and very light i love it  don t use it for more than 5 10 minutes week   but works great  very comfortable to hold   just what i needed for my purposes  i picked this hairdryer because of the high reviews on amazon  and i was not disappointed   my girlfriend loves this hairdryer   it feels like a quality item when you hold it in your hands  this dryer is a great device and works well  it s small and can easily be transported while travelling  it s also powerful and helps to dry hair out  i bought this for my 5 yea old daughter because she always wants to do things for herself and i wanted to encourage her independence  this is so small and light  she is able to handle it easily and even though i still have to watch her and help with the use of a hairbrush  she is well on her way to independence  it is very powerful for its size and comes with a nice bag and accessories  fits well in the rv  works but have not been on a trip yet to use it   amazon c s was great to look up measurements for me to make sure it would fit in the space we had   i had ordered 2  previously and they would not fit   vendors need to put measurements of units in descriptions  i needed a basic  reliable hair dryer   that is what i got  and i did not over pay for it  br    br   the option for air only is convenient   in a pinch i was able to dry out a nearly ruined paycheck without damaging it  this is a nice blow dryer  it works well  is very solidly built  somewhat heavy for its size  but that doesn t bother me   it is comfortable to hold and just the right size  medium   not to small or big   the highest heat setting is too hot for me  which is a change from my previous blow dryer  but tells me it has good heating elements   so i keep it on medium  for some reason  i thought it was black when i purchased it  but it is a very pretty dark plum color  with pink accents   very   34 stylish  34      oh  and i love the   34 cool shot  34  feature  i have very thick  curly hair and the power in this dryer does the job in great time   thank you  i love this hair dryer   i love the retractable cord   the high speed is great   i was surprised by how quiet it is  i love this hair dryer   it fits well in my hand   drys my hair beautifully and quickly   i have fine hair and this dryer is not   34 too much  34    it has several speeds and heat options   would definitely recommend  when i opened the box i was surprised by how nice it was  it has 3 different levels and the directions even recomend whates better for your hair type  their is no problem with it its just i thought it would give off more heat  my hair is thick and it took longer than expected for it to dry  i am just gonna use it till it breaks i guess  we liked this so much  we bought another for our daughter s bathroom so we could get ours back  very quiet and a reasonable value  the wattage is fine because any higher just cooks your hair anyways     time will tell with durability   its slightly big  but not heavy that its aches my hand of anything  the ionic technology completely renders my hair soft and smooth  never going back to normal hair dryer again    just discovered this  have to buy travel size as well  but this product is good  this is a great design and a good hairdryer for people with short hair  like me   but i cannot recommend it for people with long hair  since it would take forever to dry anything longer than shoulder length hair  br    br   we bought this to replace an old sunbeam 1800 watt model that finally gave up the ghost after about 8 years of hard use  br    br   this compares well  except  it only gets about half as hot as the sunbeam did   on the bright side  this won t burn your hair   will dry without damaging your hair   personally  i like it   hubby complains  because he wants to turn on the dryer  sweep it over his head about 6 times and be finished   no go   what used to take him a minute now takes 3   but i think his hair looks healthier   he could care less      he s a man on a mission and wasted time frustrates him to no end   patience is a virtue  i say  as he rolls his eyes  br    br   it has two speeds  i use low    it was easy to install  i did it myself in about 3 5 minutes  really easy    you use 2 screws to screw a small metal plate onto the wall in your desired hanging location  within reach of an electrical outlet   then just clip the dryer body onto the plate  plug in  and done  br    br   the design s great  because the dryer can continue to cool  even after you hang it up  so you don t have to pre cool it or worry about it overheating in its stand   it has a nice little blueish white nightlight built in  a pleasant plus  br    br   would i buy it again   absolutely   do i recommend it   wholeheartedly for short haircuts   i like it  the quality of ionized hair drying you get with this dryer is no less than top of the line salon dryers like chi  the build quality of this dryer is better than my chi that died on me  when i opened the chi to attempt to repair it  i couldn t believe how cheaply made it was and i was amazed at what the retail markup must be  it s like jewelry  they must be making a fortune   the only reason to buy a chi over this dryer is if you are a stylist and you have an image to uphold  i e  pretentious clientele that would look down on you for using a remington  i love this powerful light weight dryer  it leaves my hair shinny with lots of body  my granddaughter recommended it to me  she loves her dryer also  no complaints  it s light and not too noisy  it has 2 blowing speeds and 2 levels of heating which is enough for me to adjust as i need  i am using it for the last 6 month with no problems so far  i got it thru amazon and happy with it  after doing some research  i decided to go with this blow dryer because it had all the features i wanted and i was able to get it at a reasonable price  i ve had this dryer for just over a year and up until today  i only had one minor issue with it  the cord would not always reel in all the way when i pushed the button  br    br   well  sadly  today it decided to die on me  i plugged it in and it was working just fine when all of a sudden it made a weird sound  shut off and caused the outlet to smoke  i tried it in other outlets to be certain and sure enough  it will not longer turn on  i did use it pretty much every day so it had heavy use but i expect a blow dryer to last at least several years  i put this in my gym bag and the features make this perfect with folding and retractable cord  love it  i would highly recommend this  it is really powerful which is handy for someone with frizzy hair like mine  good value for such a good product  this is okay  just not like the one i am use to using  it does the job  sort of but l must air dry my hair first or if i force dry it it becomes fuzzy and i dont like that  other wise it is ok  i was worth the price i guess  this design with the hook to hang the cord on is great  but the dryer itself only has two modes    34 off  34  and   34 burn your scalp off hot   34  i needed to replace my professional grade hair dryer  and i was considering all my options  i wasn t sure that i wanted to spend a significant amount of money  so i tried this model  which had fairly good reviews  br    br   it s fairly quiet  it is not as powerful as my old dryer  but it is significantly lighter and seems to be constructed well  so far  so good  works great   just the right temp   hair never looked better with just a brush and dry   love the retractable cord   definitely the best dryer i ve ever had and at a great price to boot  the brush was really  not made well   it was not packaged well  the brush    the vents should be on the top not on the side   it will catch your hair  hardest blowing hair dryer for the price   this is the second one we bought  works great   can t go wrong  x who does not need a blow dryer to dry ones hair  it is an okay blow dryer  it will suffice for now  i had the old silver bird and it was so much better than the new one that is being sold now in some stores  the old one was really hot and straightened my hair so much better  this new one seems to even vibrate a bit when using and just feels cheap  it takes longer now to blowout my hair  you can tell if it s the old one because the word silverbird looks like the one shown  i have very thick wavy hair  and this has been the best hair drier ever  i bought two in fact so that i do not have to carry with me when i visit with my friends  i love using this hair dryer  it s simple to use and has a clean design  if you google the reviews for this product  you will see that many people recommend it  i bought this conair when my old one finally blew   after 10 year mind you   i have short hair but need something with a couple heat and blow settings   this does the trick   there are two speed settings and three heat   that gives you enough combinations to do the trick   takes me only 5 minutes to dry and style my hair   it also has a   34 cool  34  button which is easy to reach   the hook on the handle makes it easy to hang if you need to  after my blow dreyer of 10 years stared to loose it s   34 umff  34  i turned to amazon of course so look through some reviews and came across this blow dreyer  my hair stylist  who is a trusted friend even recommended it  and of course even she couldn t beat the price  it works really well  my hair is much smoother after using this dreyer versus my old one  it was definitely time for an upgrade  the power is great and i didn t find it to be to heavy  i have long fine hair and it dried very quickly so that s nice considering i m a mom with a 14 mo old who doesn t have to much primp time in the mornings     i would definitely recommend this dreyer  i recently bought the hsi flat iron   i liked it so much i bought the dryer   i like the dryer just a much   it is light weight and powerful   i have long wavy hair and this dryer works quickly without adding frizz  this is a wonderful product  i like how it has a   34 coo warm hot  34  switch and a   34 low high  34  switch and not just one switch making you choose low and cool or hot and high  i also love the little attachment it comes with to give a more concentrated blow to a specific section of hair  i would definitely buy this product again  definitely more convenient thatn going to a salon all the time  i love doing my own hair at home now and this has allowed me to spend less time blow drying and styling it  came quick  work fine for about a week now won t suction or stick to any thing  my grandson has arthrogryposis and it worked great for him but now it won t  sad  this is the 2nd or 3rd conair i ve owned  and i ve found them all to be durable  well constructed appliances  this hairdryer  maybe even more than the previous model  leaves my hair especially smooth and sleek  it dries hair quickly  and the concentrator attachment really works well so that you can put the dryer right next to your brush  my two complaints are related to the retractable cord function  1  the dryer is heavier than a usual dryer because of the cord reel  and 2  the cord is not very long  maybe only 3  34   neither of these things may be a problem for you  if you specifically want a retractable cord  the extra weight is worth it  otherwise  it s just extra weight  and if you don t need a long cord  if your outlet is right next to your mirror for instance  the short cord is no big deal  but just keep these things in mind i needed a light weight dryer because of an arm injury and this one is indeed light   i like that   i wish the cord was either longer or not curled so it didn t have to be so close to the holder  love this blowdryer   compact  yet powerful  br   typically i can t find anything that blows the air strong enough  this is by far the best dryer i have had  don t let the cheap price draw you in  this hair dryer is not worth it  i tossed my still working hair dryer that i had owned for 8 years when i bought this  6 months later it caught on fire  yes caught on fire on the inside was a bright blue flame and a burning smell  frightening  do not buy  it was a bit to powerful but it was good  as good as i d been expecting it to be  it was worth the money  this hair dryer was too heavy  and  although it claims 1875 watt  it was neither as strong or hot as the ion i had been using this hair dryer is powerful  quiet by hair dryer standards  and has a solid quality feel to it   i spent a lot of time researching different options and am happy with my purchase  great dryer if you don t like the newer types which have gadgets added to them and are very powerful   this has a powerful setting but not extremely strong so that your hair is getting a beating  powerful blowdryer  super light  my mom took this from me  i bought this dryer in 2009  she took it in 2011  and it s still going strong  my mom uses it along with my sister  my niece and 2 of my cousins and they all love it  one thing though  it is so strong you need to make sure to not burn your hair by leaving it on one strand for too long  it s not like a conventional dryer  it will cut your drying time  so use it with that knowledge  if i didn t love my current dryer i d definitely buy this one when if it dies  from amazon s description     34 guaranteed authentic  never counterfeit  4 year warranty   34   when i went to fill out the warranty card it states one  1  year warranty only   what happened to the other 3 years   my wife likes it and would rate it 5 stars  my wife was tired of have a dryer on the counter and of dealing with the wire   she loves this   the night light is too bright   i put a piece of white vinyl tape over the led cut to fit   it is still bright right through the tape   made it acceptable  though  i have a full sized chi hair dryer  which i like   i was looking for a similar dryer that i could take with me when i traveled    hotel dryers were ok  but i missed a better dry    br    br   this dryer is fine   the handle collapses so it is easy enough to stow  and it also comes with its own little cloth bag which is good to keep the cord from getting tangled up during transport  br    br   my hair is dried well  though not as well as my full sized dryer at home   no complaints  however  br    br   i would recommend this for size  easy of use  and the nice added accessory of the bag  i love it  my hair is so shiny  it dries faster and i love the attachments  i use the diffuser for my curly hair and the other for my daughters  straight hair  all around great product  bought this in july 2012  broke after 9 months worth of use  not sure what the reason was  and i didn t bother to take it to the repair shop so it s going to the recycle bin  there were sparks of fire in the wire inside the hair dryer and i did not know what to make of it  decided to give it up oh my i am so pleased  i had my other vidal sassoon hair dryer for 22 years  it went through me and 2 daughters and still works  i don t think it gets as hot as it used to  but never the less  this blower has large shoes to fill  if it last half as long i will be very pleased  love this hair dryer  light weight lots of power   great value for the money   i have paid alot more for other hair dryers with less power  awesome  dries my hair faster than any other drier i have   and my hair is thick  i would recommend this  no complaints here  i say buy this one   its a great hairdryer  and i go thru them  so good product   this is a great dryer   the three settings  low  medium and high allow for more flexibility when styling your hair   my hair  is fine so the low and  medium setting work great for me  this hair dryer was worth the money  the quality is good without breaking the wallet  also  the size is optimal  very small  easy to handle and operate  ordered it online as ssonas i returned   i love the retractable feature  it is the best hair dryer i ve ever had  i bought this for my daughter 5 months ago  she loves it especially over the one she used to borrow from me  it dries her hair very fast and the folding handle and retractable cord make it great for travel  i am thinking of getting one for myself once mine dies knowing this is a good one  great price  great item  she loves it  this is professional quality   she uses it at home and for work as well  i really like that the cord retracts   good force of air   nice that you can change speeds and or heat settings   i like that you can set it to cool or if you are using a heat you could do a blast of cool with the button   slightly heavier than i would like but not unreasonably so  my experience with this hairdryer is nearly identical to that of a previous reviewer  it s easy to install  and handy as all get out  however  almost on its one year birthday  the low setting stopped working  and within minutes it went from blowing on high regardless of the setting to becoming a fire hazard  the handgrip started heating up as i held it  and when i tried to turn it off  the switch was frozen completely and it continued to overheat even more  since it had taken on a life of its own  i had to unplug the unit and un install the whole thing  this is a great concept for a hairdryer  it can t be beaten for convenience while still being stowed out of the way when not in use  granted  an appliance that retails for less than  30 can be expected to not last forever  but i ve owned hand held hairdryers that wouldn t quit for years and years  i m disappointed  my first thought was to purchase another just like it  but since this appears to be a problem for others as well  i ll look for another solution  i love this little hairdryer     travels well  small  and lightweight   it is powerful enough for me  and has diffuser  too   has 2 settings for temp   good value and easy to handle  i am in hotel industry   i could buy thousands of these  super cheap  very quiet  with a nice night light  barely use any electricity  great heat  simple to use  very comfortable in hand  i ve never seen a guest use their own brought hair dryer  they always elect to use this   and it s obviously installed very conveniently in the bathroom   good screws and installation instructions that come with it  never falls off  always there when you need your hair fluffy  i love to keep my hair looking shinny and healthy and in the winter it gets dull and in the summer it looks fried   i live in california   this neat little gaget givese the conveinceof doing a deep condition at home for just the cost of the conditioner and a shower cap instead of paying those heavy prices at the salon  and it onlytakes 15 minutes and i can do it my pj s instead of getting all dressed up and and over paying a salon for what i can do for a few bucks  hey all  br   i am not so blessed with fine  thin hair that unless its pinned up and perfectly coifed its a frizzy  fly away mess   this hair dryer changed that  with its settings and cool air  i can dry it and leave it  no more constant pinned up hair  i can let my locks down  so yes  i highly recommend it  its not perfect  its a little bulky and takes some getting used too  you might have to change how you dry your hair  and i don t recommend traveling with it  but for a good stay at home dryer that works like a charm  has easy to use settings i love it  so much that i sent one to my sister    this hair dryer has a nice color  and has been working so good  br   so far so good    br   the turbo velocity is quick drying  is comfortable to use and easy to handling  i have had a dublduck blower for over 30 yrs           looks very similar to this one  still works  however one day it will stop and i wanted something reasonably priced that will fit the bill            so far this one is  but i rather doubt it will have the longevity my original one has had  wow for a small  compact hair dryer its great for traveling  i have little time and thick  curly hair and it does a great job and very powerful  reasonable price  traveling case and attachments  very happy  having used numerous blow dryers in my business  i have to say this has been one of my favorites for so many reasons  it s lightweight and i can actually carry on a conversation with my clients without having to lower the speed   love the design  i highly recommend this product and would purchase again  it s the little amenities that make a big difference  our club shower room was bare bones  so i decided to splurge and add a few things including this dryer   it was easy to install  and the night light is a great feature for people who use the shower room after dark  so far it s working fine  i just love my conair 1875 blow dryer   it s more powerful than any blow dryer that i ve ever purchased   i have long hair that generally takes 15 minutes to dry with my revlon 1875   the conair is three times more powerful and dries my hair in less than 5 minutes   and it s great for travel because it folds in half and is very  very light in weight   i happily give this dryer 5 stars and would give it 10 if the option was available  very heavy and bulky   does dry pretty quickly  but really can t tell a big difference from previous dryer   not bad  but just okay  andis makes a great product  and i have a white andis full sized dryer for the house  but i needed a smaller one for on the road travel in my semi truck  this also has dual voltage for overseas travel  so yay  get one  the dual wattage feature saves you from having to use a converter  the unit is very small yet plenty powerful  and way better than the dryers provided in hotels  for my hairstyle  the air concentrator attachment is a must  i m very pleased with this dryer  salon quality dryer   great size and color  love that its so quite  i ve had to adapt to the controls being on the outside of the handle  my old one was on the inside  but it s well worth it   my hair dries so fast i have extra time in the mornings   love it  love it  love it  br   i would reccomend this dryer to anyone that wants a quality dryer  four year warranty  where can you find that on a hair dryer  love how quiet this dryer is   it feels good in the hand however it is a bit on the heavy side   you get used to it after using it for awhile   other than the weight issue it is an amazing dryer  great product i recommend everyone get one  it is a good compact devise that is easy to travel with  you can put it under your seat or just hold it in your lap  it s just okay  it s kinda loud  but it gets the job done   i do however prefer the carel dryer that i had in the past  its light enough and only takes up a small space from my luggage   its good for both 110v and 220 volts  though if you will use it at 220v  you can only use the low setting   so make sure you put a tag or you might forget   it does a good job in a short amount of time and that it exactly why i bought this   good dryer had one that finally wore out and loved it so much bought another one just like it  you don t have to worry where to put it  it s on the wall  returned this as the hot was lukewarm at best  i then bought a conair infinit pro at a local store which seems much better heat wise  br    br   edited may 19  2013  returned the infiniti pro as well and bought a remington d3020 volume and shine hair dryer  as i posted in my review for the remington  which i didn t buy on amazon but was so happy with it i wanted to write a review about it   br    br   i bought this hair dryer locally after 2 strikeouts on other dryers  first i had purchased the revlon matte chrome full size turbo hair dryer   rv473v1 on amazon  but sent it back as it only got lukewarm  then i bought a conair infiniti which i also returned because even on low the intensity was so strong my shoulder length hair kept getting all snarled and knotted  i figured it was because the opening of the nozzle was too big  so i set out to find one that was narrower  this dryer works perfectly  doesn t get too hot  has 3 temps and 2 speeds and a cool blast if you need it  good attachments  lightweight  not really loud  removable filter  ionic ceramic  the color is not my favorite  but what matters is it works  love this hairdryer  using it in the uk so had to purchase suitable adaptor   works well with attachments and is very easy to use  only issue is that even on minimum setting it gets quite hot so i won t be using it with the attachments all the time as i don t want to damage my hair too much  great dryer to replace an old wall mounted one  heat settings are very good and installation was easy and fast i truly don t understand anyone who would pay more or could want more than what this hair dryer offers   it s fantastic   the settings  noise level  weight  what it does to my hair   all of it   it s great  i cannot believe i spent this much on a hairdryer  but i do really like it much better than the one i got at the large chain store  wish it cost less  but would probably buy it again        i received this product and am very happy with it   it is so powerful that even with my very think hair  it is dry within minutes   by far the best product i own for drying my hair  this was purchased to replace the one that got stomped  by accident   it is of a very professional quality  without the high price tag  great hairdryer the wife is very happy  i went with this one because it had many reviews and seemed popular have only used it twice but is doing the job   it is definitely not like the ones they used to build before   the old styles were more sturdy and strong   bought this for my mom who had a westinghouse model that had been with her for over 30 years and now is when it broke   but for the price it is all worth it   i like the fact that you can fold it and close it  i love it    it is just perfect  my daughter and i are in love with it  i recommend this product 100  this thing packs some blowing power for a small sized hair dryer  i m happy with it  plus it was really inexpensive  i don t use my hair dryer for much more than drying purposes    lol    it s simple  in expensive  and it blows a lot of hot air       br    br   it serves its purpose well    i hesitated to spend this much money on a hair dryer  and i am so happy i did   i have always purchased the cheaper drug store ones and they not worth it  my hair is so much smoother and healthier with this dryer  loved the color  works amazingly well  dries your hair very fast  i love that there are multiple setting for temperature and speed i am a hairstylist  and i love this dryer  it is lightweight  and it dries my hair incredibly fast  the cord is a little short for professional use  but i love it for myself  i m male with long hair  this dryer works just fine for me  i read the good reviews on amazon before i bought it  i feel the dryer is adequate in every way and a lot better than most i ve had  so  why not 5 stars  i don t know  maybe it is the look or the feel  but whatever it is  this dryer does a great job  for me it is just not easy to love a hair dryer  this hairdryer is a super product   i would recommend this item to everyone  it is light weight and has a strong enough power to take my frizzes away in just a few minutes   this hair dryer replaced one my mom had been using for the past 25 years or so  i finally convinced her it was time when the old one was broken in so many places i just could not fix it anymore though the motor was fine   she loves the new one because it resembles the old one in so mnay ways but with improvements   she is delighted with this conair hh320lr   could not be more pleased  this was perfect for my trip   even when i did not realize i had to turn the dial to a different voltage in singapore   it just flipped the breaker and did not burn out the dryer   when i was finally smart enough to realize i needed to select the voltage i could not have been happier   i have long hair and like to dry my hair upside down at times   i hate when my hair gets caught in the fan   this dryer had the perfect cover and my hair never got caught or tangled   it folds up for easy packing too  i am very happy with this hair dryer  i must agree with others  though  the night light is very bright  i read other reviewers who said it was bright  but i couldn t imagine such a small light being so bright  my dryer is in a bathroom off the bedroom and it lights up all the bathroom and part of the bedroom  i covered the light with 2 thickness of duck tape and it is still very bright  i like having the night light  but it could be a   34 bit  34  dimmer  the dryer works fine and i like having a place to hang the cord on the dryer so it doesn t lay on the sink  that is a great feature  fantastic little hair dryer i bought for my trip later this year  i ve only been able to work it on the 250 setting here in australia  but it seems great so far  make sure if you re australian and you plug it in with the adapter that you don t put it on high  i didn t read the instructions and nearly blew it up haha  can only be used on low here  but that s fine as it s for my trip to the us anyways  was quite powerful and i think it ll be perfect  i bought a cheaper model elsewhere but my dog chewed  the cord  liked the other better   takes longer to dry hair i use this hairdryer 3 4 times a week  great power and is quite nice   plus it s in my favorite color  red  kind of weak  i m not sure why they dont make a 1800w model  the night light is kind of cheesy too  overall good product though  i m very happy with it  its good  dryes my hair really fast and its cute too  i got 2 one for me and one for my friend she loves it as well  i use foam rollers to style my hair overnight  and sometimes they re not quite dry in the morning   so i pop on the bonnet of this hair dryer and voila   half an hour later my hair is all dry  br    br   this product is pretty lightweight so it s easy to travel with  and it seems pretty well made   i ve used it about a dozen times without any problems  br    br   one thing i ll say though is that it s kind of hard to squish all the stuff back inside the carrying case     i bought this for a trip to italy and it worked great for me   it s very small but also very powerful   i have a lot of thick curly hair so a need a good hairdryer   i also bought the diffuser attachment   i actually think it s better than the hairdryer i use at home   you will need an adaptor but it has a voltage converter so it works much better than hairdryers that don t have a voltage converter   worth the extra bucks  this is a nice little unit but only time will tell how it holds up   while conair calls it an 1875 watt hairdryer  my kill a watt meter measured 1200 watts   i suspect that the other manufacturers claims are just as misleading   i wouldn t be surprised to see them adding a shunt resistor to increase the power drain so that the unit would appear to be even more powerful   but  if they did  sooner or later the truth would be uncovered  i first used this hair dryer at a friend s cabin and i was hooked  the motor is quiet  the dryer itself is pretty light  the blow is intense  and the best part  it gets super hot  you can barely hold your hand under it for too long  i immediately went home and bought it online  i have a medium bob and the dry time was cut in half  my hair seemed fuller and shinier  my roommate was so jealous that she ran out and bought one as well  we both are big into hair tools and are now the biggest fan of this hair dryer  i came upon it in costco for such a good deal  that i bought another one  br    br   the only downside to this dryer  is that it does not come with the defuser attachment  please  conair  gimme a defuser  br    br   i would recommend this dryer to anyone with hair  i purchased this hairdryer because it s the one my beautician uses  i loved how fast it was to blowdry my hair   i got the travel one too    love it love    fast shipping too    thank you    i love this hair dryer  i bought one for myself and others as gifts after trying this at a marriott hotel  it dries my hair so fast and for the price you can t beat that  it is light and love the retractible cord  after a while you have to push the cord in yourself but i ve had it for over a year and use it everyday so it is definitely durable  i wish it came with a diffuser and other nozzles like some of the other hairdryers but if your looking for an inexpensive but reliable product  this is it  works great for me  i dont need anything fancy but this one has everything i needed  the attachments help for random things as well i have a previous conair blow dryer and it works great  it has so much power  the only reason why i purchased a second one is because i wanted a concentrator nozzle which mine did not have and i never found one wide enough to fit my dryer  so that is why i gave it a low rating  dries my thick hair in no time   i love it and wish i would have bought it sooner   it s worth the money  this does exactly what i need it to  it s really quiet which is nice  but still does it s job  quick drying process and i have notoriously hard to dry hair  so i m please with this purchase  it doesn t get too hot like other dryers i haven t had any issues with burning myself by staying on one spot too long  this product arived on time and is a very powerful dryer for the price  all the pieces are very sturdy as well  what i did not like was that in the picture the pieces looked white  which was my main reason for the purchase  but the pieces  obviously pink up close  this is one of the best blow dryers we have purchased   i am going to buy another one to keep in our travel bag  works as advertised   can t beat the price for a quality product such as this one   one of the better buys out there  it has a lot of power   easy to hold and small enough to be easy to pack for a trip the settings are wonderful and my hair did feel a lot softer after using  the heat setting are great too    i like the option of having cool  warm and hot    the dryer is super powerful and definitely cut down on drying time  and the retractable cord is great  i would definitely recommend this blow dryer to a friend  pros  br   not to hot on hot setting br   retractable cord works great  keeps clutter off the counter  br    br   cons  br   none really to mention   br    br   edit  05 06 2013 br   i have noticed when i use the blow dryer now that there some some air escaping from the slider controls on the handle  this is nothing to really change how i use the blow dryer  but this should probably not happen  ive always really liked the travel sized blow dryers  and this one is wonderful not to heavy and drys my hair in half the time  it works fine but i wish it had a hook on the handle so i could hang it up  also so sometimes my hair gets stuck in the top of it when it is drawing in air  my old hair dryer died a rather spectacular death with sparks and smoke   i hadn t researched hair dryers before  and i only wanted something that would dry my hair   so i randomly picked a conair from a local store   i used it a few times and was not happy with the results for the conair   it turned out to be loud as all get out  and my hair turned out flat   i felt like i was in a deafening windstorm   so now i had a criteria for research   something that was quiet and didn t blow my hair into a limp state   that s what lead me to this remington   it shipped and got here quickly   yes  it smelled a bit funny as all new hair appliances do when first used  but i was impressed   it was easy to handle   i liked that i didn t have to keep sliding buttons up and down to change settings like my old hair dryer   it was relatively quiet as hair dryers go   the drying process went very quickly   my hair had plenty of volume with a smooth  soft feeling when all was said and done   i m very happy   no flat hair and my ears aren t ringing   i highly recommend the remington hair dryer  googled hair dryer  found it at amazon com one of my trusted sites  ordered it and got it 4 days ago  it is better than the old one as this model has an led night light built in  great product  working fine  br    br   thanks br   amazon i love the blow dryer it works great  it was a little heavier than i thought it would be but is great  product arrived as expected and was a bargain price  i just used it for the first time and am very happy with purchase  i kept it on low setting  which was enough for my hair  the cooling button works fast to cool off curls created by your brush  would highly recommend item  best hair dryer i have ever used   i bought it b c i used it at a hotel and i love it   i have had it for about a month and it works great   it dries hair quickly  but is gentle and doesn t damage my hair   i would recommend this product to anyone who doesn t want to spend a fortune on a hair dryer that is great for your hair   works great and my little girl loves having her own blow dryer  it is a very cute and functional blow dryer  good  powerful  adjustable air flow efficiently dries hair  easy to mount in bathroom although i put in an extra screw to increase wall mount security  fabulous   had one before that lasted 9 years   hope this one lasts as long   so easy just to grap off the wall instead of searching through drawers for regular hair dryers  hotel style   very convenient  i have had the dryer for a few weeks  and so far i am loving it  it is lightweight and great at transforming my coarse  curly hair into sleek  shiny  and straight hair in a short amount of time   i have paid 2 3 times more for hairdryers in the past only to have them lose the ability to stay hot   i am hopeful this dryer will last a while   my hairdresser recommended it highly   if he loves the product in a high volume salon  then i look forward to owning mine for a long time to come  this product was worth every penny  it will work for any hair type and saves so much time  there s nothing better than not having to use your arms while drying your hair  the ionic button is the best feature  which helps prevent all frizz      spends most of it s time in my drawer taking up space and collecting dust now   it is definitely not analogous to having a third arm  i was previously using a compact hair dryer that did more damage to my hair   with the included nozzles  the adjustable temperature and adjustable air power  my hair is smoother and dries a lot quicker than before   the cold air button is also a plus if you re round brushing your hair   the non slip coating on the dryer makes holding the device very comfortable   hsi is powerful and works wonderfully   love it  i had read the reviews saying this blow dryer was small  yet powerful   i had a little chuckle when i opened the box   it reminded me exactly of a blow dryer that barbie would own and even comes with it s own zebra bag for storage   i am very impressed at how well it works   i travel for vacation at least once a year and am never that impressed with the blow dryers the hotels provide   i have very thick wavy hair that takes a good 10 15 minutes to blow dry with a decent dryer   this little dryer is comparable with my full size blow dryer  if not better   i would definitely recommend it for travel   i have not yet used the attachments so i cannot comment on them  however i did use the bag for added storage of my hair brush and hair accessories  for home use  this dryer is okay  it works fine  i like the retractable cord  it s bulky and would take up way too much room in a suitcase  the diffuser barely fits in my bathroom drawer with this dryer  i m either returning it donating it to a homeless shelter  the hotels i normally stay at carry this brand of blow dryer   after a few tries and loved the power and level of dry time  i just had to order it   i got the regular and travel size   love them both  this is a great product i would recommend it to all my friends that own salon it s easy it s lightweight and it last shonnila br   excellent product at an excellent price  the first time i used it my husband said my hair looked like it had a salon finish     love it  this is a great dryer  as a male  i don t use all the   34 fancy  34  options that this hair dryer comes with  i simply use it for 30 seconds after i come out of the shower and it works great  the two selling points that i bought this dryer is because of amazon prime and the low price compared to other hair dryers  gets way too hot for something to be used by a child    we turned it on and visible red hot coils could be seen within seconds   and the air was blistering hot   i cannot see a younger child using this without adult supervision   we returned it  i never actually thought that a hairdryer could be different from any other hair dryers  unbeknownst to me  i was sorely mistaken  this keeps the static out  and i admit that i have quite a mane of hair  and this drys it in record speeds  a lot of customization with temp speed air flow  highly recommended  this hair dryer is amazing  it has the perfect temperatures and blow strength  for thick hair that takes long to dry  this is a miracle  and it s very sturdy  firm  robust  it seems that a made a very good choice  so my previous 1875 watt ionic dryer started making my hair frizzy and finally died on me  i was looking around for a new one and found that my favorite brand in hair products made a cute stylish hair dryer  it doesn t just look nice  it works amazing too  i love how it has a setting for hot and warm  i haven t had a hair dryer with that option yet  i also really like the switch  rather than a sliding one  i have no complaints and i highly recommend it  it dries quickly and i have no frizzies and my hair looks so much better with this dryer compared to my old revlon  it s great for drying my curlies and works just as well for blowouts  too  looked nice   didn t even turn it on as it was too large for my space to hang it   need to have dimensions in description  i bought this for my mom  who has had issues with blow dryers melting her fine textured hair  she loves this one  it dries her hair very fast and doesn t melt your hair like other blow dryers can  the retractable cord is very nice as well and the dryer doesn t feel cheap  if you re in the market for a new dryer  give this one a try  purchased this blow dryer based on a recommendation from my hair stylist  one of the best investments i ve made in years  powerful but light enough to maneuver easily  it doesn t weigh your arm down  worth every penny  i purchased this hair dryer after seeing the raving reviews and it is indeed true  i have long thick hair and it certainly dries my hair a lot quicker than the other dryers  in addition  the heat is not too strong and this is helpful as it does not dry out the root too much at the same time dries the hair just right with a good flow of air  i m very satisfied and highly recommend  this is a good buy    i read the reviews on this product from other customers before i purchased this dryer   i absolutely love this hairdryer  i have owned several hairdryers over the years and have even been known to burn up a few     this dryer gets my thick hair completely dry and frizz free in under 3 minutes   i use product and a round brush and have been very pleased with this dryer   it is quiet and doesn t get too hot   i love the adjustable heat and speed settings   i also use the concentrator attachment to channel the air   i was unable to find this product at any local retailers  walmart and target are the two i checked  and i think it is better than the conair infinity x pro model   if you need a dryer that gets your hair dry quickly and with minimal frizz  this is the one for you  has a nice holding grip   makes alot of noise and pushes very little heat  could be that i was just unlucky with this one  this hair dryer arrived in good time and worked as advertised  my wife loves that it hangs on the wall in our bathroom  she finds it very convenient  would not hesitate to deal with this company again  i purchased this item from super pharmacy unica on february 26  2013   i received this item at the beginning of march 2013   i have used this hai rdryer probably six or eight times since receiving   yesterday i had to dry my hair ao i turned the dryer on and smoke began to pour out of the on  off switch   i immediately turned it off    i sent an email to the seller and i have not received a reply   i have used yellowbird hair dryers which i have purchased from other vendors for many years and i have never had a problem with this brand of hair dryer   furthermore  this seller has not replied to any of my emails   i want my money returned so that i can purchase a new yellowbird hair dryer from a reputable company  i ordered the onei mk ii air ionique hair dryer for my wife just over a week ago and she is thrilled with it   she loves the variable temperature feature   the first time she used the dryer she said   34 my hair looks great   34   i would certainly recommend this dryer   the price is excellent for a professional quality dryer and it s strongly constructed   also  the shipping service was amazing   i ordered standard shipping  thinking the dryer would arrive in five or ten days  but it arrived in just two days  this is a very good hair dryer  it doesn t mess up my hair  very good product  i would definitely recommend it  ok  so we all know that we can t pack a lot of heavy things  br   this little dryer will save a lot of pounds and it works great  this hair dryer is the best i ve owned   i have dry  curly hair and this hair dryer is powerful enough to straighten my hair without burning it    i m very happy with my purchase and will tell all of my friends about it    i moved to usa recently  and needed everything for my house  this dryer was a perfect combination of price and quality  this blow dryer is very efficient  the retractable cords are convenient and i have no malfunctioning problems at all  the colour is bright and pretty  i think i got my money s worth  i was looking for a folding handle hair dryer with a retractable cord and this one is perfect  it has more features than i expected  based on the online description  i was pleased to find out there are multiple temperature and speed settings  and it is so much more quiet than other hair dryers i ve purchased  i love it  this dryer arrived quickly and was packaged well   i replaced my old dryer that was similar to this one but this one is lighter and easier to style your hair with   itdries your hair quickly too   i don t need it on the highest setting for too long   it came with a concentrator and a diffuser  it s a blow dryer   i have never noticed any difference of any dryer from the ones my mother used on me as a child in the early 90 s to all the new   34 amazing  34  technology   let your hair air dry until it s about half dry  dry the dryer with a paddle brush and only point the dryer down on medium heat   it s all the same   i like the cord keeper and the bright color  this hair dryer is awesome  i read many reviews about it online  and i am so glad i listened and bought this  you will not be sorry    it s great  it heats up  has a retractable cord and folds for easy storage  i m very pleased with this purchase for the price   the hairdryer is powerful and heats up quickly and the concentrator nozzle is just the right size for drying your hair with a barrel brush   i also like the look and feel of it   the coating on the handle makes it easy to grip   the only con is a very minor one  and why i rate this as 4 stars  is that it s a little heavier than previous hairdryers which i ve owned but this wouldn t put me off purchasing this model again  as other reviewers said  it is light and quiet  these are two things that really impressed me  plus it does a good job drying my hair  i forgot to take my hairdryer with me when visiting a friend   she had this dryer in her guest bathroom and after using it for a few times  i said   this is the most wonderful little dryer    i have to get one   it is so powerful and makes drying not only quick but blows in lots of volume   i bought one for my home in fl and a second one to take home to my mi home this summer   i was so happy to locate it so easily by just going to amazon  i discovered this while on vacation recently   all of the hotels we have stayed in recently have had this blow dryer available for guests   it s light weight  fairly quiet  and the variable temperatures sold me   it also has a cool button which is fantastic when it s hot   i actually ordered this from amazon while still on vacation so it would be at my home when i returned  it works with it s 3 settings  hot warm and cool  it s also pretty strong and dries my hair quickly  i have long hair   i only wish it came with that angled head attachment so you can blow in a direction  so far so good   the light weight and speedy dry time help me reduce stress to back and neck muscles  it s a very powerful hair dryer  which is fine  as i have a lot of hair   it s not too heavy and there are two settings for low heat and high heat   however   the retractable cord stopped retracting within 30 days   and the plug is very clunky   it s something that would be needed in a hair salon  not necessarily your home   but it was only  14 95 and if it lasts 5 years  i will be happy   the one that it replaced was a vidal sassoon  remember him   that i bought 15 years ago for about  12 00  so i way got my money s worth out of that  i have only used it in the low setting  and it works well for me  it is a bit big  i have to find a way to easily manage the cable easily after each use though love it left my hair sooooooo beautiful like in the salon br   does not over heat br   and its small lightweigh powerful but dont let the size and weight misguide you its a powerful thing like a plane or car or boat    love it  i use it on my hair on m moms hair on my cousins hair and on my sisters hair and on my 2 dogs hair i would use it on my dads hair but hes bald lol love it     get it asap you cant go wrong the dryer was advertised as being much lighter than other models and i can t honestly say i have seen any difference in weight  i like using the dryer as it has several settings that help dry my hair  i highly recommend this hair dryer for anyone  it is light weight and dries my hair very quickly  br   it does not burn my hair like the old hair dryers  arrived and works great   good power  great price  and arrived in the exact time frame and all intact   good buy  i like it very much  for hair drying  it works very well  the two accessories are not so often used anyway  i have quite a bit of hair and it has always taken me a long time to dry it with a dryer   for as small as this baby is  it does a great job of drying hair   it is probably not for someone who styles and brushes out their hair while drying  but i am a simple person and it suits my needs   love that it doesn t take up a lot of space and love that it s pink   if you re not looking for anything fancy  travel quite a bit and want a dryer for basic hair drying needs  i highly recommend it  bought this product for my mom for christmas  she needs a new one every year  i dont know what she does but they all end up going out  this andis 8200 hair dryer has hung in there and it still works great  i would highly recommend it  its also very pretty in person  the color is great  looks good  but stopped working after 3 months  it s beyond producr return time  so i cannot return and waste of money  love this dryer  i have very thick  unmanageable hair but with this bad boy it goes from super frizzed out to soft and shiny  it s not heavy at all and i haven t had any problems with it overheating or shorting out  sounds like operator errors to me   definitely worth the money and the wait  works extremely well  dried my hair in a third of the time it takes with my old hair dryer  i recommend you spend an extra 20 bucks and buy this hair dryer instead of buying a cheap brand  it s a great deal     we have had numerous hair dryers  this is def  one of the best  forceful air and the cord retractor has worked great so far  very satisfied  one note is while pushing the retract cord button  hold the cord as it goes in so it doesnt whip around  i love this blow dryer  helps me when styling my hair  comes with 2 connectors for styling and love using them both  great product for the value and i like the color  the retractable cord is a big plus too  it was not the powerful motor ones at the salon she was expecting  however it more than meets her needs at home which was why i bought it for her in the first place  a decent price for a nice looking blow dryer  there are three speeds  three temperatures and a cold button  it comes with two detachable mouthpieces and a sample oil product you can rub in your hair before you stylize it  br    br   i m not sure how it stands up to the remington for the same price  that one looks more powerful from the description  i would not recommend this product as it is not well manufactured nor does it last for a good period of time  it is not a good investment of your money  no problems and drys my hair well  there are only two settings  however the temperatures are great  the low gets hot enough and the high gets hot  the shipment was really a big surprise  i received this product within two days time from ordering it  i used it in new zealand and australia and it worked great with plenty of heat and power  i was glad to have the voltage change switch  my twin sister loved it she need one so i gave it to her as a gift thanks i would give it as gifts i battled with myself over spending this much on a hairdryer  and i m so glad that i did  twice i have used it to blow out my hair and my thin  fine hair looks amazing with little need for touch ups with a straightener  no fly aways   when i decided to try the diffuser and wear my hair curly  i was hesitant because my conair would leave my hair super frizzy   not with the t3  i had beautiful curls  frizz free   don t let the lighter air flow throw you  this little baby has lots of drying power   great size  lightweight  and the velcro cord keeper is helpful when ready to put away  super sleek looking  br   works great  br   cold air gives out cold air n hot gives out hot  if you know what i mean  not like those hair dryers that give warm air when you want cold  br    br   good investment i like this dryer   it is nothing fancy  but it does everything i was looking for   it is powerful enough to dry my hair quickly  as well as lightweight and space efficient  small bathroom counter    i like the cool shot feature   and it was a good value  this blowdryer is okay  i orignally bought it because i heard it was a reliable brand and i also needed a new blow dryer and this was on sale with a 4 dollar off coupon  the filter that the air goes in through and then gets heated and comes out the other end so the back side it my hair gets stuck in this everytime i use it  it drives me crazy  so everytime i have to stop the bblow dryer and cut my hair out of it and clean the filter  the smell also i a dirffernt smell that comes out i dont know if thats just because my hair that gets stuck is making it smell because it burned or that its just a differnt blow dryer from my preivou one but i think i might just have t get used to it  in the days when i had hair to blow dry most handhelds just either were too hot or just plain sucked  i got this for my wife and she has beautiful thick hair if she s happy with it it s a winner  semi embarrassed to admit that i m a guy who uses a blow dryer  but that being said i don t have to use product anymore and my hair looks good after like 2 mins of blowdrying  yay  we purchased these after using in a hotel  br   great and compact  br   just bought 5 more for our second home baths so our guests will have them too  i ve been using the same blow dryer since high school  and recently it caught fire  so that was that  i spent a long time reading reviews and comparing prices trying to find a new blow dryer and i eventually decided on this one after i was able to go to target and see it outside of the box in person  this dryer is really awesome  it drys my hair fast  doesn t seem to cause too much damage to my hair and i love the rubberized feel of it while holding it  it doesn t have a lot fancy options or anything  just your generic three heat levels  three blow settings  and a cool button  however  my friend is a hair stylist at a pretty fancy hair salon and when she stayed over one night and used it after showering the next morning  she came out of the bathroom to ask about the blow dryer  she asked how much i paid for it  and after telling her  she indicated that she couldn t believe how well it worked  she also complained that she had recently had to buy a new blow dryer for work and she couldn t see much of a difference between hers and mine expect about  100  very nice blow dryer  bit of an odor the first uses  it needs to burn off before it will fade  pretty and very happy with the number of speed and heat settings  this little hair dryer is very light weight  nice   small for traveling and just as nice for every day use  it is quite powerful for being so small but drys my hair in no time at all  i love the travel bag that comes with it  this hair dryer is the best one i have been able to find  i have very long and thick hair  it used to take me about and hour and a half to dry my whole head  this dryer got it dry in   wait for it     about 25 minutes  old dryers would leave my hair super frizzy  but this blow dryer left my hair almost board straight  i almost didn t have to use the hsi straightener that i bought along with it  i never used to blow dry my hair because of the time it would take plus how frizzy it would leave my hair but now i have blown dried my hair every single time  totally worth it  i love this blow dryer  it really is quieter than any other one i ve owned  the attachments that come with it are great  and it cuts down a ton on frizz  br    br   i love that the handle folds up for easy storage  and it s really lightweight  you don t feel like your arm is going to fall off while drying your hair  it s also pretty quick  i have thick  straight hair that goes halfway down my back  and it takes around 10 minutes to dry  i only wish that i had bought this blow dryer when ever they first came out   my hair drys in more than half of the time faster    excellent product    considering the lower price this conair turbo slyler does everything it claimed it could do  i used another brand before and wasn t happy with it  i used one of these hair dryers at a hotel back in 2008 and when we returned from our trip i immediately ordered 2  i recently dropped the original one and broke it so had to get the backup second one i had ordered out to use  then i ordered another back up just in case  i have been caught short before  by different brands  and had to go to an event with wet hair  that will never happen again since i always keep a backup now  br   gets the job done and it is a nice light dryer  packs easy  just love these  never stop carrying them  please  this thing pumps out hot air pretty much instantaneously  great for people with no patience  it might be nice if it had more oomph on the high setting  but my girlfriend says the same thing so i guess i shouldn t throw stones  i use it everyday  it works great  no problems  good price  i got one for every bathroom   good power  easy buy  i ordered this product because i heard from a number of friend how great it was  i have curly hair so i also ordered the diffuser to match it  i used it once to dry my hair  it was okay  not as i was told it would be   i then tried my diffuser  i used it 2 times  i went to pull the diffuser off to go back to the drying piece  the blow dryer completely  fell apart  i noticed that the blow dryer is made out of card board inside  that is so dangerous   i tried to get a refund from the 3rd party vendor and they replied by saying   34 throw away the item  we will mail out a replacement   34  i wrote back and demanded my money   i never heard back from them so amazon luckily refunded my money  for a dryer that is over 100   this is ridiculous  br    br   my mistake was to not read the reviews  i am writing this to save people money  don t do it  i believe the blow dryer i got is a knock off and i would hope these people selling them are caught and prosecuted  after spending another vacation week in a hilton using this wonderful dryer  i knew it would be disappointing to go home and not have one  its compact  perfect heat settings  2  and so easy to use  the cord is the perfect length  i never take a blowdryer with me when i travel because i just love these wall mounted ones by sunbeam  you have one button to push to turn it on and then when you re done  just put the dryer back into its holder and it automatically turns off  its easy to clean  and easy to change the wattage setting  i mounted it near my mirror and the nightlight which i thought would not be a good thing  turns out to be so perfect in the middle of the night  having two heat settings as far as inside the dryer to save electricity is great for those that want a softer not as hot two setting dryer or those that are trying to save money among other things  its perfect  i gave away my other dryer and never looked back  br    br   get it  you ll love it  really i promise  i don t have much experience with hair dryers  that s my wife s responsibility  but she has mentioned several times that she finds this particular product noisier than she liked or expected  we have a tiny bathroom with no storage this hair dryer is so perfect it s out of the way when not in use does not take up drawer space even has a night light  update  i purchased my latest replacement  yes  if you buy this product you will need to replace it regularly  on jun 19  2017 and now it has failed on july 27  low speed stopped working so it only blows on high   the product is wonderful when it works but my amazon order history shows it is a consistent failure  purchases on jan 3  2012  mar 5  2013  may 20  2013  jun 19  2017  of the same feature  there was at least one other failure but i complained directly to the manufacturer about the short lifespan in 2013 and was sent a new one and also bought another new one at a local store and these two lasted 4 years  2013 2017  br    br   some people may ask why i keep buying this product and i will say  1  it is inexpensive  2  a few of these units have lasted for more than one year  3  the 3 holes on my bathroom wall where it is mounted are difficult to disguise and each replacement unit so far has fit into these holes  although i now use a slightly larger drywall anchor  and  4  i like having a hair dryer off my counter  br    br   original comment  i purchased this hair dryer more than a year ago and used it nearly every day to dry both my husband s and my own short hair   it is a reasonably quiet but powerful machine that does its job well   the addition of a hanger on the wall mount to wrap the cord out of harms way  since it inevitably stretches out  is a great innovation   i would have given it a 5 star review then  br    br   unfortunately the lower speed  it has two speeds  stopped functioning after a little more than a year  the higher speed is too hot and too noisy to use   i repurchased the exact same hair dryer on april 6  2013   today  3 days after the 30 day product replacement window  the lower speed stopped functioning  br    br   updated 7 14 15   the manufacturer replaced this hair dryer under their more customer friendly policy but i had already bought a new one from amazon so i stored it away   last week  more than two years later  the new amazon hair dryer quit  same reasons as before  and i was able to install the stored dryer in 10 minutes   i urge amazon customers to always consider invoking the manufacturer s warranty and remind everyone that being able to reprint the amazon purchase record provides   34 proof of purchase  34  they needed to honor their own 1 year warranty   i also  am upgrading this product to 4 stars because it continued to perform well for longer than many inexpensive electrical appliances these days and  obviously  i like the style and functionality enough to keep buying the same unit br   i won t purchase a third one   i downgraded my review to 3 stars because  when functioning correctly  it is still a very decent hair dryer   the company needs to work on their quality control issues air dryer quit  same reasons as before  and i was able to install the stored dryer in 10 minutes   i urge amazon customers to always consider invoking the manufacturer s warranty and remind everyone that being able to reprint the amazon purchase record provides   34 proof of purchase  34  they needed to honor their own 1 year warranty   i also  am upgrading this product to 4 stars because it continued to perform well for longer than many inexpensive electrical appliances these days and  obviously  i like the style and functionality enough to keep buying the same unit br   i won t purchase a third one   i downgraded my review to 3 stars because  when functioning correctly  it is still a very decent hair dryer   the company needs to work on their quality control issues  for the price it is really great  i like this product  it would be nice if it could be adjusted more than two settings but it is very handy and dries hair very fast   i suppose the more expensive one have more settings  it does get very hot  when your done it just pops back in the wall holder and the cord hangs up on the knob so it s out of the way  good power with very low noise   robust design   the night light does the job well  the dryer was easy to install  for the price it was worth it  br   i like this product  br   i would recommend it to anyone looking for the same thing  perfect hair dryer  does the job  comes with 2 add on s for scrunching hair or blowing it out straight  the retractable cord is a space saver life saver  i have thick hair and need a dryer with powerful motor and high output  while this dryer is quiet and lightweight  it did not have any more power than the  20 dryer i was using before  i could not find any wattage power specifications on the packaging or in the product manual  i am returning it so i cannot comment on durability or how long it lasts  i saw this in people style and wanted to try it   i have long thick hair and it cut my drying time in half   it s perfect and leaves my hair feeling silky smooth  this hair dryer works really fast on turbo and my hair feels very soft when it s dry   i really like it  having this wall mount hair dryer has ben a real convience  it reduces a lot of cluter around the sink it works and looks well  one of the better things i have purchased  i purchased this dryer in september of 2012  it is now april 2013 and the dryer is on its last legs  it still runs  but it powers down to a lower setting while trying to use the high setting  i expect it to quit all together soon  this pro bonnet style dryer shipped fast from the seller and was easy to assemble   it is whisper quiet and does a great job drying hair evenly   i recommend this product  have been using the yellow bird dryer for a least 20 years   it s the best blow dryer on the market bt conair i have three teenage daughters so recently i purchased three different hair dryers from amazon  imagine my surprise when i realized two were essentially identical except for the price  the length of the cord and the brand name  the pro beauty tools 5885 professional lightweight hair dryer is the exact same as the revlon rv544 1875 watt tourmaline ionic lightweight dryer  silver black by revlon  both of these hair dryers are made by helen of troy  both have the same handle  body  and heat speed options   both have the exact same intertek number  3175842   the major difference is the pro beauty tools hair dryer does have a cord that is 2  longer than the revlon dryer and it  the pro beauty tools  has an extra filter included  for the  10 difference in price  pro beauty tools higher  one can decide if these options are worth the extra cash  in my opinion both of these items are a five star item for price and performance  ok  yes  it is a little bulky  but it s because it has tons  and i mean tons   of power  which you can easily control so you don t burn your hair  the cord can be   34 sucked in  34  in 2 secs and then just put the whole thing away  beautiful  overall  i m quite happy with this hairdryer  i didn t give it a 5 5 because i m not quite raving  it didn t transform my hair  like some people claimed  or dramatically reduce my drying time  but for the price  this hairdryer is a great value and i think i ll be using mine for quite some time to come  br    br   i ve owned this hairdryer for about a month now  here are my impressions  br    br   pros  br     doesn t get as hot  but dries my hair in about the same amount of time as my old  non ceramic  non ionic  hairdryer  if anything  a little faster   lower heat is less damaging to my hair  so since this dryer still gets it done just as quickly  that s a good thing in my book  br     has three heat settings and two intensity settings  allowing for lots of control  br     has a cold shot button that functions well  br     retractable cord is very convenient for traveling and storage  br     design is sleek and attractive  br    br   cons  br     i wish the cord were just a little longer  maybe i m asking for too much  but this one seems a little shorter than my last  and i find myself pulling on it fairly often  br     the hairdryer is a bit heavy  but nothing unmanageable  get that arm workout  br    br   i haven t used the diffuser or concentrator attachments  so i can t give an accurate review of those  but just out of the box and unmodified  this dryer has proved to be a good purchase for me  i bought this hairdryer after my sharper image was dropped after years of service  br   the pro was well rated by good housekeeping  that seemed to bode well  however  after using it 3 times i must say that it is an annoying tool  i use a round brush  and the slightest movement turns the hairdryer off or onto another setting   happens 4 5 times each time despite trying to get used to it   the switch is not designed well  br   it also has a high speed and a low speed  but the desirable middle speed is missing  br   the weight is good  seems very light  and the price is good   the hairdryer does leave my hair smooth  but i would advise you to keep looking  and not settle for the pro  this dryer was not for me and amazon refunded my money immediately  this is a regular dryer  i have fine hair that gets frizzy and needs to dry quickly  i now know i need to stay with the professional models  this is one of my best purchases of the year thus far  i m very happy to have purchased it as it has changed the texture of my hair tremendously  i never knew how much a blow dryer can have such an effect to the results of your hair  my hair is so smooth  soft  and shiny  i use to dread blow drying my hair and instead forfeited it altogether  i would only blow dry on special occasions and preferred air drying because i have very long and thick hair so it would take my full hair to dry 30 45 minutes and even then there would be spots still damp  my hair would get caught in the vent  it was extremely hot under the blow dryer    basically it was more of a hassle to blow dry my hair  with the t3 it is so pleasant and 10 times quicker to dry  i love the efficiency and ease the t3 provides as well as the amazing results  br    br   i had my mother try my dryer out so she could feel the difference and she was instantly converted  she commented she never knew that a blow dryer could make such a difference   we are use to buying cheaper dryers because we didn t think a more expensive dryer made a difference   this is a great investment and what a deal you get from purchasing on amazon  i see the t3 dryers on sale at tj maxx periodically but it is still no way near the deal i got on amazon  right away i bought one for my mother  per her request  and we can gladly say we have never looked back  this conair 1875 watt turbo style dryer really does do a great job ob drying my hair  very quick and efficient  i am happy with this blowdryer overall  i like the smooth coating and the light weightiness that allows it easy handling  br   a couple things that do bother me  the attachment comes off easily  i knock it off at least once during my blow dry session  i m also not cool with the cool button  it is easy to press and i end up cooling my hair off when i don t mean to  this product is excellent  good quality  durable excellent presentation  i had no problems even with quality  thanks you for it i lovedd my blowdryer  i always been useing twinturbo  blowdryer but i love how light this is and even more powerful  the hair dryer looks and works great  but the bright neon green nightlight is truly ugly   thought i would just press the gfci switch to turn it off  but the button has a rubber overlay that is very hard to push   so i opened up the dryer and disconnected the light  not as powerful as i had hoped  the speeds and temperature control are sufficient  still takes a while to dry my long hair  so this is not as impressive as some  still  for the price  it s fine  the true test will be how long it lasts before breaking    the hot tools hair dryer works wonders  it s so easy to use  all you have to do is attach it to the nozzle of your blow dryer and you can deep condition or set your hair  with a conventional standing dryer  the back of my head does not dry evenly with the rest of the hair  but this bonnet gives me all around coverage  drying my hair in 20 minutes  i ve had this dryer for close to 8 months and i ve used it every week after i wash and style my hair  it s survived both my tightly packed suitcases  and my weekly toss into the cupboard when i m through  this may not be the dryer for people who set their hair with large rollers as this fits snug against my head with just twists  but other than that small limitation  this has been the best hair dryer i ve ever owned  i love this hair dryer   it has great power and capabilities   much better than anything i ve found in drug stores  i was never a fan of blow dryers but this one was awesome i didn t like the attachment that accompanied the blow dryer but overall it works and i like it i recommend it  love this blow dryer had the red one before but the wiring was cut   this one is stronger br   works great    good price very easy to mount  even easier to use  the unit automatically shuts off when returned to the cradle  no need to spend money on higher priced units  very nice product do not buy  it was great while it lasted  but it shorted out after 3 months of use  br   quiet and seemed to be quality   until its very early smoking  stinking death  br    br   find another that lasts longer  works wonderful  gets hot and drys very fast  shipped fast  would buy another one if i had to  if you need heat to your hair you wont go wrong purchasing this item  this is a fantastic little hair dryer  i bought it two weeks ago after reading the reviews and absolutely all the positive reviews about it are true  i love the power it throws out  it is quick and nice in doing its business  it is a little noisy but i guess that is something which i felt in my previous dryers from other brands too  a point to note however is that though the product description indicates    and removable concentrator make this a versatile styler     there is no concentrator that i received in my package  so if you are looking for a hair dryer with a diffuser or concentrator  then this product does not come with one and you may need to search and buy one separately  does everything the manufacturer states and the price was well worth it   shipping was quick and product was in good condition   would recommend this hair dryer  i have full size t3 for the home  and i wanted a compact t3 for travel  because no one wants to have a bad hair day on vacation  think of the pictures   i need a decent dryer to handle my long hair  hotel dryers are always pretty cheap  and my old mini travel was useless  t3 travel dryer is pretty comparable to the full size  you still get fairly fast dry times  softer hair  no frizz  and more volume  the only difference between the travel and full size is that the travel drying times are a bit longer  it also comes with a little travel pouch  as an added bonus  br    br   you can certainly get away with buying the travel dryer for home use to save money over the regular one  which normally runs  200  and you really have to wait out the sales   it works better than a typical semi professional dryer in the same price range  works better than my old tool science dryer  which was about  60   br    br   my favorite thing about the t3s is that they can actually handle restyling my hair when it s already dry  none of my old dryers could ever do this  i had to spray water in my hair and re dry   br    br   another review mentioned the drier did not have a serial number on the nozzle  this was not my experience  my dryer had the sticker with the serial number under the nozzle  look for a clear label that says danger   i highly recommend registering your product on the t3 website  i had problem with my full size dryer  not this travel size one   and the t3 co  honored their warranty and fixed it  have used it 4 times  powerful  easy to handle br   and dries hair in half the time of my  easy to hold handle design  best of all  it is small and lightweight  br   highly recommend this dryer  this hairdryer is everything i need  great choice for me  would reccomend to anyone that does not need a professional type hair dryer i purchased the t3 featherweight luxe dryer from a retail store  it lasted about 9 months  i contacted the company but because i didnt register the product  i had to pay another  55 to ship it off  6 weeks later  i received a newer t3 2i model  but it didnt include any of the extra accessories that my first one did  including the diffuser which i use everyday   called the company back   and instead of just sending me a diffuser  they tell me that i have to send the whole thing back and that they will ship out a new older model  in other words  another 6 weeks without a hair dryer to get the diffuser that i need  so   by the time i purchase a new diffuser for  30 and pay the  55 for a replacement  i could just have bought a brand new reliable chi or something  don t buy the t3  it s more trouble than its worth    you can get a cheap one and it will be of the same quality  i have  2 girls and me with long hair in my family  i find very helpful to use for different hairstyle actually with very long hair  br   i gave only 4 stars because it is not the best quality but for the price is good enough  br   was a good buy  try it  i really expected it to dry my hair super fast after reading the reviews  but i would say it takes just as long as a normal hair dryer  i like it  and it works good just not as fast as i had hoped  this is a really good blow dryer  i have unrelaxed aa hair  makes my hair really straight and manageable  the only down side to this dryer is that it s really heavy otherwise its great  but my first one was  300  i was thrilled to find one at this low price  and it has additional features  i love it because it works faster yet quieter than other blow driers  is supposedly healthier for hair  mine is definitely less dry since using it    and doesn t blow my hair all over at the high setting   it is very pleasant to use  also my first one was a featherweight and i didn t notice that this one was not until it was already shipping  i decided to see if it was heavier  and it is not  so i am completely satisfied  i bring this with me to nice hotels because it s always better than whatever they provide  i ve been using this exact same hair dryer for 20 years   there s a reason i keep buying it even though it seems to die after 4 5 yrs of constant use   the nightlight is perfect for the master bath   now we don t wake each other up in the middle of the night by turning on the normal light  have had it for about 2 years  works superbly  has lots of power  the handle still folds as when it was new  the retractable cable mechanism still works like it did when it was new  affordable price  all things considered it is a great product  i first encountered this hair dryer while using one at a hotel   i was so impressed  i wrote down the name of the dryer and searched for it on line   i bought this unit from amazon and used it for several years   it finally saw its last day   i immediately went back to amazon and purchased another one   i received it within 2 days and am once again content  br    br   pros   retractible cord  folds for packing  dries very well  affordable and salon friendly br   con   sometimes gets too hot my husband does a lot of traveling and had commented he liked the hair dryers that are in hotels that hang on the wall  i bought us one and am sure glad i did  it s nice just to reach up and have it there ready to use  instead of having it in a drawer or under the counter with the cord wrapped around it  loved it so much bought our son and daughter one for there homes  they like theirs also  br   would highly recommend  would be great if it had a rubberized grip around the handle for better control  but other than that  it s worked great so far   good power  heat on high is pretty good  the hairdryer works just as it was described   it is small and compact  so it s much more easy to handle than drug store hairdryers   i would recommend this hairdryer to anyone who has long  thick hair  i have long  very thick  dry and damaged hair   br    br   i would also like to say that i will be a faithful amazon customer for any products i need and amazon carries   i was blow drying my hair when the hairdryer fell to the floor and broke   i contacted amazon and  without even questioning me about why the hairdryer broke  amazon replaced it at no charge and it was delivered in two days   i am extremely impressed with amazon   thank you amazon   i really appreciate your customer service  that s what i needed  it s fixed on the wall and always ready to be used  very convenient and efficient  great  revlon rv408 1875 watt full size turbo dryer is ok   it is a little bigger than i expected  but it is also good  thank you   i love remington products   this hair dryer has performed perfectly for the  20 i got it for on amazon  br   i replaced my conair ion shine after 7 years   regret not doing it sooner  br   my hair was frizzing and i thought it was because of my age   nope   my conair was shot  br   so since the on off switch broke on the conair   i finally decided that was unsafe enough to warrant a new hair dryer  br    plus i never like the switches on that dryer anyway  br   i love this tstudio hair dryer   it is not too loud   which is great if you suffer from hearing or headache issues  br   i love the color   it is extremely attractive   it is a dark chocolate brown with a pinky purple accent   goes nicely with my bathroom decor   oh   and the best part   it does not hurt my hands   it is ergonomic   i feels like a dream   it is a perfect fit in my palm and i don t feel the switches are in the way at all   i found that i naturally held the dryer so the thumb was grasping along the length of the switches which is perfect   so excited about that part  br   was going to buy the bablyss  sp   but when i checked that out on youtube  i intensely disliked the noise of it  br   so   remington it is   i hope that i get at least 3 or 4 years out of it and i will be an extremely happy customer  we use this multiple times a day and it is very convenient having it on the wall  liked the idea after seeing it in hotel rooms  so glad i purchased this one  so many options out there  but i didn t want to spend a lot  so i choose this based off the reviews  so glad i did  it works great  is super fast compared to all other driers ive had  which is many  and i love the ion  i wont buy one without it  and can tell a difference with ion  if you hold in the blue button it will give you cold air  which is great  you don t have to change the switch to cool air  just hole in the blue button on any setting  great  it gets hot  but not so hot that it burns your neck  or my daughters neck  which is always a problem with the girls  she used to hate the hair dryer cus it was so hot it burned her neck ect   however it is hot enough to dry hair very quickly  which is a great deal for her  since that was her other problem with them  and its great for me too  since a lot of time i barely have time to even halfway dry my hair  now i can fully dry it in that amount of time  it is easy to hold handle  and has all the options that an expensive dryer would  with the add ons  2 different ones    they clip on and off easy also  it is sturdy  i have had it for a couple months  and i am very rough with them  leave them in the bathroom  laying out  or tucked beside the makeup table  laying in floor  or just through under the cabnit   and i have had no issues at all  it doesn t have a scratch on it  amazing  i would recommend this to everybody  my sis already got the same one  after using mine since she loved it  and still does after a month  and now my mom has the same one as well  and we all bought them on here  to be sure it was the exact same one  since in the stores it gets kinda confussing since so many are similar but not the exact same  so  yes  recommended  love it  love it   love it  was exactly what i was needing  girlfriend has now purchased 3 of these  the turbo option is great and we will continue to get the same model my girl only wanted this hair dryer to replace the same one that just died   found it here on amazon far cheaper than anywhere else and with amazon prime it was delivered to my doorstep in 2 days   great price and my girl loves it  she says it dries her thick hair fast and doesn t dry her hair out in the process   so that s it   highly recommend  i love this hair dryer   i asked my hairdresser how he achieved such silkiness and shine in my hair  when i  using  the same products at home  couldn t   he told me the blow dryer is the key   he told me to buy from amazon for best price  and to make sure i chose the featherweight t3 by  bespoke labs   it is delicate  i keep it in the box and put it away as soon as i m done  which is 10 12 minutes   if it is dropped  the tourmaline technology can be damaged and will not work   it is definitely worth the extra care it requires  it dries my hair fast and leaves it shiny  sealed and beautiful  does not dry out my thick  coarse hair  hair is softer  more manageable  and more conditioned compared to a standard hair dryer  highly recommended  living in the south  humidity takes it s toll on my hair so i was excited to visit vegas where i d heard there s   34 no humidity   34  i planned to use the hotel s hair dryer  mgm  to lighten the packing  the hair dryers they equip the rooms with were amazing and i kept telling my husband how much i loved it and how quick it dried my hair    i wanted to take it home but he wouldn t let me  ha  he told me it was probably just the dry air there and didn t understand my excitement over this hair dryer  long story short  i got on amazon as soon as we got home and ordered it  i am in love  this hair dryer cuts your drying time in half and leaves hair shiny and smooth  and trust me  i have frizzy  wavy hair   i still use the flat iron of course to finish off the job but this hair dryer has been a life saver   highly recommend   well  i had a turbo 1500 for a long time until it died  then i made my research and found this new and powerful version of twin turbo 3500  so  i wanted ti invest in something good  i do my own hair at home  and my hair is curly  i finished to dry my hair so fast  i just  love this twin turbo 3500 and it worth the      i have thin hair and this dryer did an awesome job w giving me lots of volumn  i m happy to have given it a try  keeper  enjoyed this dryer for many cruises and wanted my own  have not been disappointed    powerful and tiny  delivers as promised perhaps i am a creature of habit  but when i dropped my old vidal sassoon hair dryer  for probably the 500th time  and broke the back cage off  i just wanted to replace it with the same exact model   unfortunatley  since i had that thing for 7 8 years  they don t appear to make the exact same model  but this one comes pretty close  br    br   what i like  br     comfortable to hold   the proportion and shape of the the handle are excellent br     lightweight   so your arm won t get tired holding it br     3 heat settings   and the   34 very hot  34  is actually hot enough br     price   under  20  br     color   my old one was grey  but this red is kinda sassy  br    br   what disappointed me  br     speed   the highest speed is adequate  but it s not as fast as my old vidal sasson hair dryer  rip  old friend  br    br   overall  i recommend this to anyone who needs a basic hair dryer for not a lot of money  and if past experience can be repeated  this thing could last you a good half decade or more  depending on how often you knock yours off the bathroom counter  this is the second of this product that i have owned   the first lasted over six years but unfortunately quit working so i ordered another just like it   works great   i don t have to go hunting for the hair dryer and plugging it in and putting it away every day   i highly recommend it  this is the seocnd one of these i have owned and the first lasted over 10 years   gret product  glad i could find it again on amazon  br   the mutipe temperature settings make it a dream to have   love it    it is a simple hair dryer that i think works well  especially for the price  the only gripe i have is that the cord is on the short end  other than that i am happy with it    the one major downside to this drier is that it vibrates in my hand which i don t like  it does dry my hair very fast and the cord keeper works perfectly  this hair dyer works great and i have seen it for more money at local stores  i highly recommend it  i thought this dryer would be perfect  compact  not clunky  and easy to travel with  that s really the only thing this dryer is good for  to travel with  all the main functions  useless when i had the bonnet on  dare i move an inch and that hose would fly right off  and the highest heat settings was not hot at all  i painfully sat there with the bonnet on and putting the hose back on about a million times  to only come out with 30  dry hair after 30 minutes worth of sitting  this product was cheaply made and without any thought put into it  i will be returning   one of those   saw one just like it in a motel while on vaca with my gf a few years back   i thought more of it than she did  primarily because the more things kept off her bathroom counter  the better   br   that s what she thought  too  that i bought this as a  message     which is why she s used it maybe three times in four years since i installed it there for her  br   it s a great hair dryer  i let mine air dry  my hair looks more like michael bolton s  or fabio s  that way   br   this little dryer still works great  i guess  i turn it on every once in awhile to check   br   yay  relationship issues  i purchased thi dryer from amazon based on reviews   my wife loves it   it is light and powerful   a real professional hair dryer   subsequently i purchased on for my daughter  who also said she has never had one even close to this   she said iit makes her hair as when she goes to the beauty parlor   i plan to purchase one for my other two daughters   a superior product  quality  this is the best hair dryer i have used  hands down  my favorite feature is that it doesn t produce a ton of noise like the t3 i previously had  and if you have a sleeping baby in the next room you ll really appreciate the low noise it makes  the performance is perfect and the temperature and fan speed are fully adjustable  i set mine on negative ion  which helps my hair look great before work and after the gym  my wife and i share it and she s as satisfied with the quality as i am  br    br   price  for the price  you can t beat this dryer  i paid over  200 for a t3 and the onei feels  looks  and sounds like a better product  the performance of both are good  but the onei has more adjustment options  so i have to rate it higher  br    br   shipping  i came back from a two day business trip and it was waiting for me  even though i didn t expect it for a week or so  of course the wife got to it first    br    br   customer service  the seller sent me a nice email to make sure i was satisfied with the quality and shipping speed  i couldn t ask for better customer service  br    br   overall  highly recommended  both dyer and seller  thank you  this was a great purchase  the unit is relatively quiet  simple and works better than expected  it is so convenient to use every day  the night light is a small but appreciated bonus  yes  i love it   it is so easy to use and the force of the hot air dries my hair very fast  best hair dryer  definitely worth the money  gets super hot  fast  making it so much easier to blow dry my hair since usually itll take an hour to dry but only takes about 15 minutes with this one  i recently upgraded my old dryer of 8 years  br   1  this was slightly heavier than i expected  only because my old one was super light weight  however  the weight is not noticeable other than that  the material of the dryer is pleasant to hold  br   2  cute design with two optional add ons is a plus  br   3  dries quickly  i can fully dry my thick shoulder length hair in 3 4 minutes  br   4  much quieter than my old dryer  br   5  the only con  is that the buttons sometimes can be pushed when drying the hair because of the way they are positioned on the handle  so  if you do not have a mindful touch while blow drying  you may accidentally switch from high output to low output  this product is very very good  i purchased it after seeing my roommates use this one  it is completely worth the money and it gives a nice blow dry leaving your hair feel awesome  we are very picky about hair dryers and this is the best hair dryer we have ever had  it has a long cord and lots of settings that actually differ which makes it easy to dry hair for kids as well as adults  i have recommended this hair dryer to friends  i thought this would be a bit smaller and had a retractable cable   in the end  it s still a good product  it broke on me on the second use   looks and feels cheap   i rather pay more for a higher quality product  wife wanted a professional quality hair dryer   has been using for over 2 years and still going strong   well worth the money  love it  this is my third one   great speed light weight   only wish they lasted longer   but for the price you can t go wrong i chose this dryer based on product description and customer reviews   it performs well and is lightweight   i highly recommend  love this dryer love that its red  not happy with the concentrater it did not fit on the end  had to use an old one i had  but the andis dryer i had before is on its fourth year  i am a hair dresser so i use it a lot  the only reason i brought it home was because the vent on the front broke  so i can t use it on clients any more  i am sure i will enjoy this one if not i am sure u will hear about it this dryer allows me to move around while my hair is drying  have conversation and  watch my favorit television programs  br    br   you have to be sure that you snap the bonnet seal to the tube so that it locks before putting it on   you may have to practice a few times to know how to lock it  br    br   great product  this is an awesome hair dryer   in fact  the best one i ve ever used to give my hair volume   i m middle aged with fine and thinning hair   a couple friends commented that they thought my hair was getting thicker once i started using the dryer  i wish it were     however  those comments are directly related to how well this dryer works   i ve been using the 2  34  wide attachment so that it really dries the roots  which adds volume and lift  br    br   this would have had a 5 star rating  but as others have said  the buttons are in an awkward place   i m constantly accidently turning the dryer off or the temp to another setting   and  yes  it isa bit heavier than the standard dryers  but not much   it feels sturdy and like it will hold up over time  br    br   definitely recommend this dryer  its a hair dryer whats to say  my wife wanted a hang up dryer and this one works well so far  br   only downside is the night light  its a good idea but is a little too bright and there is no way to dim it  overall a good buy compact size perfect for traveling and powerful enough to do its job  i am very pleased with it and the price is very reasonable  the dryer has a very powerful motor  i ll give it that  unlike some other reviewers  i found that the hot setting was more like a warm  most significantly  though  it left my hair oily er than usual  it basically left it limp  i m confused as to the reason for this  but i m sending it back  regardless  br    despite hating the condition it left my hair in  it did dry it relatively fast   i purchased this mini hairdryer because i travel a lot  and because i have a small bathroom and i don t like taking up a lot of precious counter space  plus  is it just me  or have regular sized hair dryers doubled in size over the past few years  they re huge and over sized  in my opinion  i saw that this came with a travel bag  zebra striped  as well as a diffuser and concentrator attachment  for the price  around  15   i thought this was a great deal  i was expecting to be let down by this little hair dryer  but i was pleasantly surprised with it  it works great  and i haven t had any problems with it  the only thing that would make this better would be if they could include a  cool  setting  but for the price i paid  i m not complaining  br    br   if you travel a lot or if you just don t want a huge hairdryer  this is a great hairdryer  very good  we recommend it for multiples use for home and traveling when the the hotels do not have dryer  a great little travel hair dryer  very light yet powerful  works even better than my full sized one  i use it at home too  i m a hairstylist  this dryer fit me like a glove  love it  concentrator attachment is nice and wide  and the dryer is really quiet  not heavy at all  highly recommend  it was one of the cheaper hair dryers  but it worked as agreed br   it is exactly what i expected and it came fast to large than was pictured after i ordered this one i found a smaller one  the 124 ar vagabond and it meets what i needed every time i use this to dry my hair  most of the time i let it dry naturally  but i use a hair dryer occassionally  i receive compliments on my hair  get it  love the wall mount  turns out it wasn t all that easy to mount  especially if you are patience impaired  four months later it over heats and shuts off  i do have long  almost hip length  and thick  it generally takes 30 45 min to dry my hair  i can t blame the hair dryer for over heating  it usually takes 3 4 minutes to cool down and finish the job  i don t like that it only has 1 heat setting  a   34 cool  34  air setting would be great  especially when it is already hot and humid  the night light is very bright  not a bad thing  but it could be turned down just a tad  i think i ll do more research before i buy another one  but i definitely do love the wall mount  not as strong as i hoped  not as compact as i thought it would be but it s better than my old one which was a lot more powerful in it s better days until it went bad  i really can t rate this one  because it was a x mas gift  but my sister asked for it and she had had one just like it and she asked for another one  so i guess she loves it  worked like a charm  a great buy for a simple  no frills blow dryer  i have no real complaints  i mean  it does exactly what i would expect a blow dryer to do  so    this dryer is very nice  and my wife is completely satisfied   on the other hand  i liked the older one better because it was more forceful and the cord was longer   we didn t have to dim the light on the old one  but this one is very bright and i had to tape something over it to tone it down   i used a piece of thick paper that i cut to exactly cover the light and it is ok now  br   it s a very nice product and i think that we would order it again  love it  the controls are easy to use but do not get in your way   it runs much quieter than other hair dryers i ve used  i love this hair dryer  however it doesn t last    i have had to replace it three times in five years  my hair dresser recommended this dryer   she said it would reduce frizzies   it has and i am pleased   i like the way it folds up for traveling   i will get great use of it  this is perfect to keep your bathroom working area free for other things good power  no more storage problems    purchased another one for guest bathroom     i like this product   it dries my hair fast   the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i have only had it for a month   we will see how long it lasts  bought this for my mom after i used her old one and decided it sucked big time  she said she likes it and uses it everyday  i have yet to use it but she was happy  great product  have had it for about a month now   seems well made  love the soft coating  plenty of power  cool touch button works well   only one slight negative    the placement of the temp  switch is right where my fingers fall on the handle and i always turn it to medium instead of hot heat  but a minor consideration overall  got this with an on line coupon which made it an even better value  i love it   works very well and plenty of air velocity to dry anyones hair   highly recomended for anyone whio needs a good hair dryer  it s noisy   i knew when i bought it that it wasn t silent  br    br   it works great   warms up fast and the attachment it comes with helps me direct the air  so i m not putting air where i don t want it and making my hair poofy   i like that it has separate switches for temp and how fast the air is coming out   the controls are side  by  side on the handle   on the handle there is the option for warm and hot  and the one next to it has low and high   there is a cool button on the back up by the mesh  when pressing this  it takes about 2 seconds for it to blow cool    and on the side of the barrel there is the option for turbo on and turbo off   this gives 4 speeds of air flow  br    br   just make sure the handle is all the way up  otherwise it will start to fold down on you  it does sort of catch in two places  so it won t close on your hand   there is also an inch and a half two inch gap  so it s impossible to hurt your hand  i use it on my hair and also on beeswax sheets for rolling candles   works really well    works good aa bb cc dd ee ff gg hh ii jj kk ll mm nn oo pp qq rr i bought one of these for traveling and my stepmom was visiting and she used it and loved it so much she wanted one for herself so i ordered her one as well  she  loves the power and it s lightweight  it s been almost a year since i purchased this hair dryer and i love it   i love the retractable cord and the different heat settings  as opposed to just having low and high options   works great  compact and light  but powerful for a travel hair dryer  we unplugged the hotel dryer and used this one because it worked better i liked the dryer   while it worked  out of nowhere  it would not blow hot air if it is on high  customer service told me i have to mail it back to them and pay for shipping   the new one cost less than the shipping costs  that is if i wanted to waste more of my money and get another cheap dryer that would not last even a year  so dissapointing i like this hair dryer  i just needed one quickly so i didn t really check it out  i just grabbed it and ran  it dries very well without burning your head off and that is an important thing  i don t want my hair burnt but i don t want to take a long time either  this one does both those things  i highly recommend it  i think you ll like it too  nice unit but not enough room to store everything in side compartment   you can put items in  but unit will not close i fell in love with this hair dryer in a marriott hotel  and took a picture and found this exact model at amazon   it works like a charm for the past 4 months  very good heat  low noise   my 5 years daughter hates hair dryer with loud noise but she likes this one    but it suddenly broke last week   i had to run to a shop to get a hair dryer  br    br   but would i buy it again  may be   since it is so cheap  the price of one of my lunch   i may bought two  in case one breaks   this is just me  the hairdryer is not overly powerful but i have long  thin hair so it does the trick  i wish the cord was a little longer but i m sure it will relax over time  i agree with other reviewers that the night light is a little too bright  i just unplug it at night and since i installed it directly over the outlet this has not been a big problem  overall i am satisfied with my purchase and it keeps it off the counter  i particularly like the little attachment to hang the cord  this blowdryer does work and blows great but the only problem i have is its to small i will buy a new one and give this one to my 11yr old daughter i ve tried the more expensive ones out there  including the gold n  hot  on  wheels   the bonnet dryer    my hair never got dry in the back and in the crown area when using the gold n  hot dryers   for years i used the conair hh320lb pro styler bonnet dryer  and my hair dried very quickly   when mine finally conked out after about 10 years of use  i went to walmart to purchase a new one  and to my surprise  they no longer carried them   i went to sally beauty supply  target  and other beauty supply stores   no success   finally  i thought   34 amazon  bet i can find it there   34   sure enough  there it was   i ordered it immediately   i love the fact that this dryer has the option to open and close the vent on the top of the hood which is where other dryers lack   i keep the vent closed for fast drying   i am a licensed cosmetologist who uses the commercial industrial dryers at that salon  but at home  i use my conair   works just as good   thanks conair and amazon   never stop making this product     i love this hair dryer  i bought it as a replacement after my second revlon dryer bit the dust  i use it on the low warm setting and it s just perfect for my hair type  thin damaged hair   not too hot  but not too cold  dries my hair super fast too  literally under 5 minutes and done  my other 2 hair dryers hardly put out any heat on the medium settings and took forever to dry my hair  very happy with this since again  my hair is already damaged from heat  br   i really love the comb attachment it came with too  i ve never seen anything like this before  after your hair is dry almost dry  if you put the dryer on the low hot with the attachment on  it really helps with straightening your hair and pretty much eliminates the need for a flat iron  another huge plus  it comes with a concentrator attachment too  but i don t use that  br   the dryer is very lightweight  quiet   the cord is short so you re not tripping all over it  but there s still enough length to work with without pulling it out of the wall  br   this is a great little hair dryer over all for a small price  this blow dryer is exactly what i was looking for  it s not outrageously priced  simple  lightweight  and dries hair fast  i bought an andis wall mount dryer 25 years ago and used it every day without problems so i decided to get this model as a replacement when the old one finally gave out   i m hoping that it will give me the same great service   the unit is larger than my original more compact version  but it does work well   the reason that i m giving this product a 3 is because it s more cumbersome  the slide switch on the handle is difficult to operate   it doesn t slide easily  and there is a very bright night light built into it which i was aware of  but was surprised by the level of brightness it emits  it s too bright since my bathroom is part of the master suite without a door on it  i had to put duct tape over the light to try to block it out  this dimmed it about 50   obviously i d much rather not have the light  or at least have an option to turn it off  exactly as described   so small   when it arrived  i thought it looked like a toy  but this little dryer works   just used it traveling and it absolutely beats the standard hairdryers found in hotel rooms   doesn t weigh a thing  takes up no space and works just as well as full size dryers   great decision  it works  i didn t expect anything wonderful since the price was low  you get what you pay for  i guess  i have long dark hair that is prone to grease  this dryer makes my hair manageable and makes it feel clean  i love it i am very happy with my new hair dryer  it drys my hair faster and does not heat it up so that it looks frizzy  i recommend this dryer  it is heavy but that is not a problem and the buttons are fine right where they are  i researched several ionic ceramic hair dryers and ended up with this one and i am in love  i m glad i didn t spend more because this one gets the job done and you can keep some cash in your pocket  i have thick hair and if i were to let it air dry  it would have this ugly frizzy wave to it  i love that this hair dryer came with a concentrator and diffuser  i use the hair dryer by itself first and just finger through my hair with the setting on high speed and high heat to just get the excess water out and then throw on the concentrator and low dry with my ionic brush  i m literally amazed at how fast i can dry my hair with this thing and i m kicking myself for not getting one sooner  after continual use  the cord eventuall stops retracting all the way and that is a disappointment   dryer itself works great but we purchased this because of the retracting cord  it s a great simple hair dryer  works fine  2 speeds  cooling blow button  that s it  can t complain for the price  it s strong and light weight  easy to use  i don t need fancy    dryer  we tried other brands after the first t3 died  but they never matched how well the t3 performed  my wife explicitly asked for another t3  got it  and she loves it  this dryer if fantastic   it works very well with my hair style and even if i used rollers it would comply   set up is very easy   there is great heat control from the top of the hood as well as the knob   easy to open and close i wanted a blowdryer that i could easily travel with  br   this little dryer has lots of power  and very happy that is comes with the concentrator  which many of the others dont   br   only thing is it does get pretty hot  so you just have to get used to getting around that  does it comes with the front piece  i want to make sure before i purchase this dryer  it had happend before to me i ve only had this blow dryer for 3 or 4 days  but i already love it  the older one i was using was more than 20 years old and the difference is amazing  i have no idea if the tourmaline or any of the rest of it mean anything  but the difference between this dryer and my old one was great  my old dryer would almost burn my scalp and had only two settings high hot and low low  after drying my hair with this new dryer  my hair was silky and soft and  yes  no frizz  it also dried my hair very fast  i used the high speed with medium heat and it was perfect for the drying  then i turned it down to low heat and speed for styling  br    br   this dryer has separate buttons for heat and speed  i spent a lot of time staring at the picture that was on this page and could not tell if there were two buttons or just one  so i wanted to mention that  and i uploaded some pictures of the buttons as well  the buttons are next to each other on the handle  on the inside where your fingers grip  the sliding buttons are not easily moved  so it s not likely that you would slide them unintentionally while drying your hair  br    br   i ordered and received this blow dryer from amazon com  but the dryer they sent me was slightly different from the one pictured here  it looks almost exactly like this one  but the silver design on the side is smooth and it says you on it instead of infiniti and doesn t say conair underneath  though it does say conair on the nozzle part of the dryer  other than that  the dryer they sent me is the same as this one  same specs  same buttons  same cord  so perhaps it s just a newer version of this dryer and the photo is outdated  the dryer i received also looks darker than the one in the picture  but it s a sparkly dark teal that looks very pretty  br    br   i m very pleased with this dryer and recommend it  before purchasing  i saw the reviews of some that said it didn t last long  but i decided to order it anyway  since i didn t find another i liked better than this one  only time will tell how long it will last  but for now  i m very pleased  br    br   04 10 2013 update  i wrote this review when i d only had the blow dryer for a few days  so i wanted to do a quick update  this blow dryer is still great  i love it  my hair has never looked better after blow dryer  i still have the same little quibble that i had before  though  the little tie that is attached to the cord is just much too short  it makes folding up the cord a pain  i have to put my glasses on and struggle with it for several minutes  i have a hand mixer with the exact same type of tie on it  it s just a little longer than this one and it s so easy to attach it  if they d made this one even a half inch longer  it would have been so easy to use  i will probably try to find some alternative to keep the cord folded up  but they really should have just put one on that was long enough  br    br   even so  the blow dryer is great  i love having different speeds and heat levels  also  the hottest setting doesn t burn my scalp etter than this one  only time will tell how long it will last  but for now  i m very pleased  br    br   04 10 2013 update  i wrote this review when i d only had the blow dryer for a few days  so i wanted to do a quick update  this blow dryer is still great  i love it  my hair has never looked better after blow dryer  i still have the same little

is great  i love having different speeds and heat levels  also  the hottest setting doesn t burn my scalp  i discovered this hair dryer at a hotel i was staying in and loved it  after i got home  i went on line and found it at br   amazon for a really good price  it is small enough to pack in a suitcase without taking up much room  but heavy duty br   enough to handle my thick hair  i love it  good little blow dryer for travel internationally  worked perfectly with 240v  i have never found a hotel blow dryer that works on my curly frizzy hair so it was great to have this tool along  especially in a very humid climate  lots of air volume and heat  don t bother looking for a transformer for your 110v blow dryer if it s more than 1600w because you will have problems and possibly even damage your appliance from home  i ordered this off amazon as it was half the price of target   i was worried that it wouldn t be powerful enough or hot enough as i have long  middle of my back  thick hair   it works just like a bigger dryer and is the size of my hand   i travel all summer and never take a blow dryer with me because they take up too much room   got this dryer and remington travel curlers   its all good   both are great for traveling and work better than i expected  i have had this for over a year and it still works great br   the cold button works fast br   the cleaning sheild is a great feature to remove lint i am so happy with this purchase   it works absolutely great   i have very thick hair with natural curls   normally it takes me about 20 to 30 minutes to blow dry my hair and then i have to go over it with the flat iron to get it completely straight   it took me ten minutes tops when using this blow dryer and it was perfect when i was done   not only was it straight but i was able to style it as well   i have to say i m shocked    and happy   i would definitely recommend this product to anyone who blow dries there hair straight  this dryer is compact  has a powerful fan and blows a lot of heat  my wife loves it  not really quiet   like most dryers  really good hairdryer  purchased this one after our other conair  who s still going strong   was just getting too old  speeds are nice and it doesn t burn you like our other one did  also surprisingly very light  this is a great standard size blowdryer   it has multiple heat and power sessions  and the internal cord storage helps keep clutter down in the cabinet under my seat  despite the fact that it doesn t have any air temperature settings  air temp and strength are all combined i think  as low  medium and high   i greatly prefer this hair dryer over my old traditional style one  the comb attachments are awesome  and i feel like my hair dries much quicker and straighter now that i use them  the way the dryer vertically spreads the air throughout your hair leads to quicker and more even blow drying times and styles as well  br    br   i haven t used the brush attachement with the blowdryer but actually sometimes use it to just brush my hair when it s wet haha  works like a charm  i bought it for traveling but i use it all the time because it s powerful and lightweight  definitely recommend the hair dryer and the seller  i have no regrets about purchasing this hair drier  it does not frizz my hair at all and is easy and quick to use    i bought this as a second hair dryer for the home   i like the retractable cord feature  and the heating element is pretty good   it could use a little more air flow power though   since my original hair dryer broke  i am in the market for another one    this one still works good  but my older hair dryer broke   br    br   i am surprised to see that in about 11 months time  this dryer has gone up in price by 2 5 times what i originally paid   back in april 2012  i got this for only  10   on march 6  2013  today   amazon is now selling it for close to  25    guess i won t be getting another one of these    i love the hot and cool settings  does a great job overall  and i m excited to try the diffuser it comes with i used the one much more expensive than this before but it broke and i bought this  it works really well so far and its ionic function makes my hair smooth and soft  i m very satisfied with it  this dryer is compact and easily portable   it does an excellent job of drying hair over event the largest curlers  this is one of my wife s favorite presents   it puts out a forceful flow of air  dries her shoulder length hair quickly and fits snugly in her gym bag it s a pretty good sized hair dryer  takes a lot of space to put away if you don t have a large sink cabinet  br   overall  it doesn t seem to require too much time to have your hair completely dry  however i really dislike the feel and design of the buttons  the ones to choose the temperature and the level of drying   they feel really flimsy and like they re about to fall off  i already have one like this  but i bought this one for my mother  and it s working better than mine  thank you  i purchased this hair dryer because i liked the design   sliding buttons on the handle with separate controls for temperature and wind speed are good features   i saw there were mixed reviews  but assumed revlon had made the product well   after two months of 10 to 15 minutes of use a day with the included diffuser  it spit blue fire and turned itself off   i m thankful for the safety feature  but have returned the item for a full refund   i m not willing to risk catching my hair on fire  a great hairdryer at a great price  it s very quiet and powerful  arrived very fast and i would recommend this product arrived when expected and working br    br   this feed back im providing is good    the package arrived when expected and in good shape met all my expectations  small  compact  plenty of air  heat etc   good for travel since handle retracts and is lightweight for travel  great  i used this at a marriott on visits and realized that my hair really looked better than at home   i bought one for myself and now my hair looks good all of the time   thanks  this is the best hair dryer ever fast drying and easy to hold and use   our family has used them for br   a number of years it s very similar to those hair dryer you find in hotel rooms  it does what it s supposed to  but it takes a little longer and it only has 2 speeds  which is on the description   it s a good buy for the price  but it doesn t fold  which would be harder to put in a suitcase  overall i m satisfied  this hair dryer is perfect for long hair   it is easy to use   i am very thankful i got it  this hair dryer is amazing  it s light weight makes it easier to use  it dryers your hair super fast  i would definitely recommend it  i love the different settings and the drying capability   i dries very quickly and is great a creating volume   it is a little heavy  but worth the weight  we have had this for long long time  my wife uses this almost everyday and still works very good  she dropped the other day  and still works very good  since i use this every day  it needs to be a good  reliable product  and that s exactly what it is  it looks like it would be too small to be effective  but not so  this little gadget really blows  and in a good way  the dual voltage aspect makes it good for international travel  get one  you won t be disappointed  i liked this hair dryer so much that when my old one finally died i bought another one  some hair dryers are so loud they sound like a fighter jet taking off  this one is much quieter and is also quite light and easy to maneuver  you can t beat this for the price  it works very well  the three temperatures and speeds give you a good range of options depending on what you intend to do on your hair  the difusor has a good size and it s a great option for curly hair  i just didn t see a big result in reducing frizz  which can be hair dependent    i use this to melt beeswax to help preserve leather   it works perfectly   it was cheap and it does what i needed it to do  i like this item very much  easy to take and easy to control  that s exactly what i want to use in my daily life this is a great little hair dryer and i like the various settings   my only complaint is that it s a bit noisy  but that s to be expected with most compact dryers that put out any volume of air  this is probably the best hair dryer i ve ever had   i have really thick  corse hair and haven t generally dried it much in the past because it would take so long   then once it was dry i d have to straighten it because it would be all frizzy   not anymore     this thing dries my hair quickly and also leaves it very smooth   i love it   now i dry my hair almost daily since it doesn t take me an hour from start to finish  i blow dry my hair almost everyday and it used to be a chore  this hair dryer has made the process time go by so quickly  leaves my hair smooth  and is affordable   if you re thinking of investing in an amazing hair dryer  invest in this one  it s half the price and totally worth it  good hair dryer for the money  seriously  i ve had one just like it for almost 8 years  love it  so this one for less than  10 is awesome  my only frustration is this blow dryer is loud   my four year old now shuts his door just to avoid the noise this dryer produces   i used to have a t3 tourmeline dryer which was good but it d just run it s course   i wasn t in love with it so thought i would try what many reviewers claimed was a very professional dryer for a reasonable price   i also wish it had a medium blow setting as well  as there is a really dramatic difference between the low and high and i have to be diligent to be sure the high setting doesn t make my curls frizzy   i will keep it  but just two things i wish i had known  this product came up in a search for travel hair dryers   it is not a travel hair dryer   on the down side   heavy  probably because of the cord retracting mechanism  which is powerful enough to pull a tooth with   handle is uncomfortable to hold and is very thick   the bulbous end of it is so wide it cannot fit in the drawer where i keep hair dryers  and it s a ittle too loud   on the good side  does a truly fine job of drying and styling hair  and i really like the results  the price is fair  i purchased this and received it two days later  as always amazon com shipping is superior  ive never had issues with an items sold from amazon com although i have with their third party sellers  i thought this was a safe bet  i attempted to use it for the first time today and it caught on fire    i was using it in a bedroom in a safe outlet that i use for chargers and other items with no issue  it was not around any water  my hair was dry and was using it to help make it straighter  at first it had a smokey smell and i thought maybe this is like a new hair dryer smell  my straightener sometimes smells like this if i use with my hair wet so i thought this was fine  i turned it out waited 5 mins then tried again and luckily i cautiously turned the hair dryer away from hair to make sure it was safe and sure enough fire came out i turned it off unplugged it and it patted it down with a blanket till i stopped  i was sooo scared  luckily i wasn t burned but my blanket had to be tossed  amazon com was helpful with processing a return and i still think revlon products are great but something must have been wrong with this particular one so be careful with this  i got this to put in our guest room and then  comparing it to my vintage model  claimed it for myself  i don t know how much   34 times  34  have changed since the last time i bought a hairdryer  but i was surprised at its slightly reduced output  it s light  though  which is an improvement  and it s easy to operate  so i like it overall  this is the best darn hair dryer  my daugthter asked for her own dryer so i didn t want spend a lot of money on her first dryer  this works way better than mine and i spent 3 times more on mine  it dry s faster and isn t as loud as mine  it s smaller and lighter  i think i might just have to get me one of these also  great little drier  heats up quickly and blows hard  i wish it had an attchment to direct the air better  i bought this hairdryer because i stayed at a marriott  hilton   in providence  rhode island  and this was the hair dryer that the room was supplied with  i didn t think anything special of it when i first walked in  or when i brushed my teeth  i didn t realize what a competent little hair dryer this thing was until the next morning  when my hair was wet  and i need to dry my hair  br    br   the andis rc 2 ionic 1875w ceramic hair dryer with folding handle seriously blows  i mean that  it puts out an impressive amount of heated air  the settings are appropriate   low  medium  high  they all provide about the amount of air you d expect  the heat is nice  nothing special there  but it dries hair  br    br   i don t think i ve ever owned a hair dryer i ve liked more  granted  this is only my third one ever  but still  not too shabby  just okay aaa a  a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a just wanna finished this    cause everyone would walk out of my house with it  all of my friends want one   it is so cool  only thing i wish is that it was a bit more powerful   high is what i would consider as medium  but i still wouldn t give it away  every feature is that of style     awesome dryer  handles well  dries the hair fast  very easy to control  the only negative   its a little heavy  love it and would recommend it to all  this hair drier is superb  it is small and powerful  it is great for home or travel  best one i ever owned  pros br     lightweight  best feature  br      trong force of air if you want it br     multiple heat controls br    br   cons br     i don t think the diffuser does much  but i really don t care about that  the clip on our old one finally broke after years of usage   the girls liked it so much i bought another one   definitely a good value   keeps the dryer handy but out of the way   and as a bonus they hadn t changed the mounting system so i just pulled the old one off the wall  adjusted the cord length and snapped the now one in  this hairdryer is quiet and light and dries my hair very quickly   it has cut my drying time in half   i love the long cord  too     update as of 2 26 15  this has been a great blow dryer for just over two years   this morning it died though   i was using it and it seemed like the cord was coming unplugged as the power seemed to be waning and then ramping up   i checked the cord and it was securely in the socket   this lasted for about 10 seconds and then sparks shot out about 6 inches from the handle and it died   i threw the dryer down and yanked the cord out of the wall   wtf   that was crazy   i never expected to have sparks fly at my face this morning   so  it was a great dryer until it almost blew up in my hand   i still give it three stars as it was great for two years  i have owned a hot tools hair dryer    model 30001    but could no longer use it because the bonnet attachment to the hose broke   i was very happy with this hair dryer and therefore expected the same results from a newer hot tools hair dryer  br   however    the thermostat setting is too too hot    i cannot use it at all on high  setting and barely on the middle setting    i have  managed to   34 get the job done  34  by starting on the middle setting as long as i can stand it and then switching to the cool setting  and then manually pulling  the bonnet to a peak over my curlers   my model 30001 had five heat settings  br    br   in addition to this the new dryer is very nosy   almost has a whistle to it   the bonnet is heavier and not as flexible  br   in short   i am not happy with the new dryer   do you have another model with more heat settings  br    br   a problem with both models    the hose easily becomes detached from the bonnet while in the process of drying  the unit quit working on the lower setting  and it blows more than it heats and dries   it has basically quit working  my husband has resumed using our ancient one  which we can no longer hang up  which was my impetus for purchasing a new one    they just don t make things like they used to   we just threw it away  i ve always used kurukuru and i m glad i got it on amazon because it works great for me right now  i don t know what i d do without it  i bought this because i just moved and have been using my sister s hair dryer up to this point  i couldn t afford to spend a lot of extra money and i am already purchasing a million things for my new apartment  but being a female with thick  long hair and bangs  i  needed  a hair dryer  i was skeptical to purchase something so cheap  but really  wow  this is perfect for me  it blows strongly on high  the heat is quite warm  and the cold setting is fantastic  br    br   i bought this for  8 and am so happy about it  don t waste your money on a more expensive one  i really don t see the point  if you really want to dry your hair quickly then this is the dryer you re looking for  it gets very hot and i love it  it is good for my hair  i have very thick curly and frizzy   i love anything that can put away the cord in a snap and dries my hair half the time as my other regular hair dryer   they are right  ionic technology does work   i have no regrets buying this item   it works as advertised  i love the cooling blow drying feature  i don t have to spend hours to get my hair dry  a great buy  i m a professional hairdresser so i need a powerful blow dryer that s light  this serves the purpose it s powerful  light and hat  six of the seven stylists in our salon use it do i guess there s nothing else to say  like many  this was purchased because of the experience i have had with andis clippers   they have lasted 7 years plus   this was great  at first   after a few months use the power started gradually getting lower and lower   now it barely produces enough air to blow a tissue   it is less than a year old so i contacted andis about sending it in for repair   i have yet to hear back   their website points you to the repair facilities in your area   one problem  they only service andis clipper products   it makes me doubt whether andis even makes these or just slaps their name on it   if i don t get a response from andis  i will take this apart and see if there is another manufacturers name inside  br    br   update still no response  so i called again   i was told they do not service hair dryers  they simply replace them   so i am returning it  at my cost  for a replacement  br    br   new update received my new replacement   fyi  use a flat rate usps bubble envelope and shipping will only cost  5  the ritz carlton hotel provides these hair dryers  after staying at one of their hotels i loved the hair dryer so much i bought one  this is great for me because i needed a new dependable hair dryer  conair products are always a great to use this was a great christmas present  the haet adjustment and cord extension were great  the gfci was a good addition and the color was cool  good quality and not expensive price  i would like to recommend you to buy it  a pleasant shopping experience     i ordered this hair dryer when my hair dryer stopped working  i received it in just a couple of days  what i love about this dryer is that it is dries and allows me to style my hair so much quicker than my old dryer  and the price is reasonable  this small dryer really does its job   i relied on other s reviews which were extremely helpful   the most expensive product is not necessarily the best product  and this one proves it   great value  it does a good job with the heat ranges  the only thing i replaced a travel dryer with this and it just seems so big and bulky great dryer  nice and light weight so my arms don t get worn out drying my long hair  great power too  i was a hair cutter for ten years back in the 80 s   nothing has ever beaten the yellowbird as far as power and design  this was my second purchase of this dryer  the prior one lasted many years and was still working when i replaced it  the only problem with it was the plastic buttons were cracking and falling off so i glued them and kept using it  i like the new one just as we ll  it s efficient and well made  i do tend to accidentally change the temperature setting when i m using it simply because of where the buttons are and how i hold the dryer  i recommend this dryer despite that  i use warm setting to dry and style and the cold setting to set  the product works great for my needs  i plan on using this for trips and a back up at home in case my other hair dryer quits working  the hair dryer works well and was easy to install  br   it was a little larger than i expected  br   overall  happy with the product  nice size  color and not heavy weight  it works very well and three options for blow air are very comfy  it doesnt take too much time to dry my hair  folding handle and retractable wire are really useful   very happy with that  i was looking for a dryer with no heat option    those that i have found before have the button that you have to press down in order to get the cool hair   this one is different you can totally dry your hair without using any heat at all because  you can just press cool air button and unless you change it you only use the ambiant air like a very powerful ventilator    i ordered two of these dryers  i had used them before and i trust their quality  but  when the product arrived  i found that there was no  plug on the end of the cord  these units are made to be hard wired into the electrical system  i didn t see that clearly spelled out in the descriptive text when i was looking for the product  as such  instead of going thru the hassle of returning both of the dryers i went to ace hardware and purchased some plugs to put on the cords  now i m just hoping and praying the connections don t heat up and set the house on fire  br    br   but the dryers themselves work great  i stayed at a hotel in chicago that used these in their room  and was so amazed by how much power comes out of this tiny little unit that i googled how much they cost  to learn that they are only around  25   now it s my go to travel dryer  and everybody is always so impressed with it   i will be buying more  and i hope they never stop making these things  great bang for the buck   my hair has never been happier   i wish all purchases were so easy and i wholeheartedley recommend this product  works well  no problems yet  but when it s on the highest setting it still feels like there should be some more power coming out of it  she is a lover of all things hello kitty and this hair dryer just happens to be a really good one   light weight and she still has her style and fun  i had this particular hairdryer before and it had gotten broke  i looked everywhere to replace it  i love the wall mount feature  it doesnt take up space  its compact and has great power  i would recommend it to everyone  dries fast  quiet  sleek  bought for my dad for christmas to replace an old remington he had that also had the dual motor  works very quickly and it very nice looking  lasts a long time too  my dad had his old remington for 6 years  lol it was time for an upgrade  im sure hell have this another 6    ha this is compact and puts out more air than my full sized blow dryer   i bought it because of it s dual voltage settings because i work internationally and will be traveling to ireland soon   i have been using it every day since i got it because i like it so much  i love this blowdryer   i love how i don t have to mess around with the cord anymore   the cord does  however  get stuck sometimes and you have to unwind it and do it over and over again until the cord is properly inserted back into the blowdryer   i also get this burnt smell from the dryer after using it for 10 minutes   still  i like this blowdryer more than the ones i ve used in the past  dries hair in no time at all   great price great product   lightweight and fairly quiet   i am hoping that this drier lasts many years  as did my last conair dryer  pretty good product  low noise  will buy again  pretty good product  low noise  will buy again  pretty good product  low noise  will buy again i plugged it in turkey and it blew out right away  so i didn t have a hair dryer during my stay there  i am giving it 1 star  since i can t seem to be able to choose 0  the only purpose i bought this dryer for  was to use it in europe  the hairdryer had made a strong electric shoot the moment i turned it on  plus i was using it in low tepmreture and it melted the front cover and it was very hot  wont recomend it  this is an amazing product  it leaves both hands free to do your hear  i have my on my mirror and it has not fallen off in the 2 months i have had this product  i am very pleased  this is also great for someone missing an arm or someone who does not have full use of both arms  i m pretty lazy  i will avoid excess walking at most costs  my ass can prove it  br   so  we needed a new hair dryer for the changing table  we dry off our baby after we use wet wipes on her butt  and after she gets a bath   and we had to have one that was fast and could have a   34 just warm  34  setting  this one is so good that i find myself walking from one end of the house to the other in the morning to dry my own hair at the changing table  without a mirror  no less  it s that good  so i just need to get a second one now because i can t keep this extra activity up  br   oh  and it s loud  i don t know how they d make one that isn t   but i love the 4 settings  cool slow  warm fast  hot slow  and hotter fast  and it dries my hair in half the time as my old crappy one does  even though it has the same wattage  br   i also like the fact that it s white  even if the cord isn t  that s actually annoying to someone like me who bought a white hair dryer because there are only bright colors in the nursery     and now i have an unsightly black cord sticking out like a sore thumb   i guess you can t have it all  doesn t blow enough air  i need to buy a better one  great size and i did not have to wait too long to get it  i travel all over the place   this is a great dryer   it packs well  dries well  and  works in all countries  this hair dryer is great  it s lightweight and dries my hair in half the time of all other hair dryers i ve used  thanks successfully received good product  i hope very soon make a new purchase with you                        if you are looking for a good quality hair dryer without too many hairstyle requirements it is a good choice  you have different choices of heat  anyway  it meets my requirement  this hair dryer is compact  folds up  has a retractable cord and is powerful   my husband loves the sleek design and the compactability  this is a great blow dryer for the price although i would like it if the cord was a bit longer  all i know is i straighten my hair almost every day now because instead of the old 8 minutes of drying time  this hair dryer gets my hair completely dry in 2 1 2 minutes   i love the retractable cord and it s small  sleek size   great buy for the price  this was purchased for a trip to italy in february   indeed  i am a woman who plans ahead   i used it sunday  monday and tuesday  but on wednesday it blew out and i had to go to the grocery store to buy a new one  more powerful  that worked very well and cost the same   don t waste your money  i absolutely love this blow dryer and the attatchments  i usually buy chi for my blow dryer but the last one shorted out within a year so i decided on trying hot tools and i was in love  multiple settings so you can dry style your hair just right and the attachments work great for stying my bangs and straighening with the blow dryer  i would definitely buy hot tools and recommend this blow dryer to anyone  this conair wallmount dryer with led night light was my second purchase   my first conair served and lasted me a long time  therefore  there was no question that i needed and wanted to have it replaced with one of the same  it s about time there s a nice working hair dryer that pumps out the heat to dry hair quick  i m a guy with short hair and this dryer does the job in 2 3 minutes  the dryer has a heavy and solid feel to it  not like the light plastic feeling dryers  also  the retractable cord actually works  i ve traditionally purchased conair brand hair dryers  most recently  the conair eco hair dryer  which no longer appears to be available    i needed to purchase a new one quickly  saw this one in a local store  and picked it up  br    br   this dryer has several very nice features   first  it has three heat settings  hot  warm  cool  plus two strength settings  low and high    in addition  you have the option of boost the air flow with the turbo button and also using the cool shot button to set your style   i have found that what works best for me is to mostly dry my hair on the high heat high power setting  then go down to the low power for a minute or two of styling   using this method  i am able to complete my overall drying time significantly more quickly than with my old hair dryer   this dryer s nozzle is a bit longer than that of my old dryer  meaning that i bumped my head the first few times i used it  but i quickly got used to this   for a larger dryer  i find it to be relatively lightweight and relatively quiet as well  br    br   another feature of this dryer is the removable back to allow you to clean the lint screen  although i was attracted to this concept  i am unable to get the back off   perhaps we just have a dud  but it simply does not move   also  i should mention that the attachment is huge   i hadn t really planned on using it anyway  but when i did try to snap it on to the dryer  i could not get it on easily  br    br   overall  i have have been quite happy with this hair dryer  i just wish the back would come off   my final rating is 4 1 2 stars  br    br   edited 4 1 13   good news  i was able to get the back off this morning   it seems like it just suddenly came unstuck when i tried it again  after many tries    i was able to clean the filter and put the back back on  and now it comes off easily with a slight turn clockwise   still very happy with this hair dryer  my wife s blower was sounding like a tractor so we knew it was time   found this very inexpensive blower but ordered it because of the great ratings   it s just the right size  has lot s of power and at  7 77  you can t beat the price   she had purchased one for  30 at a local store before we found this one  but fortunately hadn t used it and was able to do a return   one great feature is that the rear inlet screen can be totally removed to clean out the lint   great deal  have used this for many years and can t live without it  happy to have found it  will continue ordering it whenever needed  br   thanks  as long as my wife loves it   i m happy   she loves red and finally she has one with all the features she desires in a hair dryer  it seems to be doing its job so i can t complain  i don t really use a hair dryer too often and i m sure there is a lot better choices out there but for the price and the size   easy to pack   it seems it is a good investment  i would recommend  this is a 1600 watt dryer with 2 fan speeds   heats up quick and is very handy mounted on the bathroom wall  which  was very easy to do with the supplied screws  i am very happy with this dryer  i like the fact that it s light weight but does the job  shipping was very fast  this will be great for traveling  just got it and works great so far but then the first i got also worked but just after 1 year started to spark and smoke   not a lot of use   thought i would give sunbeam one more try   will update later  this hairdryer is pretty but doesn t get hot enough to dry my medium length hair   keeping it but wouldn t reccomend it to anyone  i used this blower last year when i stayed at a marriott hotel   i needed a new blower at that time and found it on amazon   it works fine and i have no complaints  makes my hair shinier and it maintains the keratin treatment  it is lighter than the one i had before  it is not small  so that s a disadvantage if you are traveling  but it is powerful  recommend it i ve had this dryer for 3 years now  it still works well  does the job   there s nothing super fancy about it  i just like the color  had decent reviews and i like having a retractable cord  this hair dryer has a good weight and feel  solid consistant heat at different settings    a great buy at a great price  love the small but powerful size  used virtually daily for 5 years and just wore out  i immediately ordered an identical replacement   no clutter on countertop  cord hanger  just a great unit  i was not too happy with this hair dryer  it s a nice hair dryer but doesn t blow very hard and it takes me longer to do my hair  i have a hana professional hair dryer that is ten times the hair dryer this one is  i would say it s a fairly good deal for the price  i gave  200 for my hana professional and it is still my favorite hair dryer i m mainly using the t3 bespoke hair dryer for a back up  we were looking for a replacement for our hair dryer that died  it needed to be powerful for long hair  this one does the job  my mom had this blowdryer and i fell in love  it s very powerful and dries your hair super fast   worth the money  it took me a minute to figure out which way to actually use the thing but now that i ve got it i love it  thank you for having this available for me to purchase at a decent price  a welcome addition to my wife s beautiy gadgets  this is exactly like one i used in a luxury hotel   i was so impressed with it that i had to have one of my own  purchased this for during my recovery from shoulder surgery   we used the anchors and screws to permanently attach this to the wall   now after recovery  i still use this when i want a great looking salon style blow out of my long hair   i wish i had purchased this years ago  as it makes styling my below shoulder length hair super easy  i had use one many times in hotels  when i found out i could order one i ordered two  br   i love mine lot of power   blows hair dry great  i am glad i buy two  great price for a great product  has a small light that turns on while your bathroom light is off  i would highly recommend it  love this blow dryer  does exactly what it says   dries fast with less frizz  lighter weight and quiet motor  too  would definitely recommend   it works fine  i am buying a new one  i thought this would be fine for work but as it turns out  its rather loud  has no heat settings  and the concentrator falls off      i ve had it for over 2 months and love it so far   i have no problems with the nozzle falling off  it blows my hair dry in 1 2 the time it took before  and my hair feels so much softer   i love it  we use this in our guest rooms at four seasons   i recently bought it for the gym since it s a full size but you are able to fold the handle   it s really quiet and powerful   great value too   the retractable cord is also great esp  for travel  i have had this hair dryer for about 6 months now and it works great  the night light is still on and works fine  this hair dryer is exactly what we ve been looking for and this is the only place we were able to find it   it was easy to order  and the shipping time was short   i will probably order again from amazon com  it is a good thing that my limited edition revlon blow dryer broke after only 6 months  because i replaced it with the john frieda full volume blow dryer this morning and i was simply stunned at the difference in quality  i have had many brands of blow dryers over the years and it has always taken me at least 10 minutes to completely blow dry my very thick hair  however this john frieda blow dryer took my very thick  shoulder length hair from soaking wet to bone dry and ready for hot rollers in three minutes  yes  you read that right    three minutes  this blow dryer is going to save me so much time when i am in a hurry and trying to get out the door  it is worth every single penny and then some  i love  love  love this blow dryer and highly recommend it  i hardly ever write reviews of products    i can t even remember the last one i wrote  however  i m pretty inspired right now  this dryer has cut my styling time to less than half of what it s always been  it s not frizzy  so i m not doing tons of follow up flat ironing  and  the most important part is that my ridiculously thick hair is completely dry when i m finished  br    br   now  it remains to be seen how long this hairdryer will hold up  but for now  i m pretty sure this is the best purchase i ve made in years  i wash and dry my hair everyday   i used this hair dryer in a hotel and loved it   i ve been searching for a good hair dryer that didn t break the bank for years   my husband also commented that it drys my hair quicker  it leaves my hair so soft   my hairdresser even said i must be doing something right   the retractable cord is great   and  i love the folding handle for travel  do not underestimate the size of this dryer  my goodness this dryer is hottttt  i have weave in my hair and i decided to wash it and lord this dryer dried the hair within 10 15minutes  i really really really like it and for the price  you can t beat that  what more could you ask for  great product  it dries my hair super fast  a friend of mine has had hers for years and i am hoping to as well  its just what i wanted and i am happy with it   there is nothing more that i can say about this dryer with the exception that it is working very well  not too loud  toggle switch is a nice feature  and most importantly    you can hold onto the   34 head  34  of the dryer without worrying about it getting too hot  i never like to hold the dryer from the designated handle region  so this was a really nice feature  good price too  i used to use the babybliss dryers  but found they were too powerful for my hair  so i opted for this product  and i love it  exactly what i was looking for  love the retractable cord and the folding handle  sturdy unit with good power  would definately recommend  this has to be the best hair dryer i have ever used  my hair is thick and tends to get frizzy after i blow dry it  but with this dryer my hair is shinny and healthy looking rather then looking like i stuck my finger in a electric socket  it dries it quickly and gives it a more styled looked  love this hair dryer and would recommend it to anyone  this is a powerful  quick  perfect hair dryer  definitely recommend it for salon professionals  the price is unreal     it s better than the 150 dollar models i ve had in the past  it works pretty good is easy to hold and not heavy like some of those out there i really like this  other than that it s fine  i have one other minor objection  i mounted mine in the leg well under the dressing area on the left side  there one can see the led light leaking out the bottom of the cabinet and not just through the bezel that it is supposed to  the light leak is something i could fix with rtv silicon  i just haven t bothered  a better design would include a case that fits better to it s base and doesn t leak light  and would also only have the light on when it s dark instead of all the time  again  it s not quiet  we bought it for our guest bath  so as much as our guests stay here they shouldn t go deaf  no way i d put up with this noise if it was our primary  this unit doesn t deserve to call itself quiet  so if you need quiet keep shopping  great product   my daughter uses it everyday  this was a christmas gift and it s getting used  holding up just fine   shipment was fast and packaging was great  i have used the same hello kitty hair dryer almost every day for 5 years  it is light weight but not when it comes to heat and air  i have thick long hair and it dries quickly and smoothly  i like it so much i have purchased several for gran daughters  girl friends and once as a bridal shower gift  everyone has elaborated on how much they like this product and a few have carried on the gift choice to their family and friends  i had purchased them at target but now  thanks to my amazon prime shipping  i don t have to purchase  then spend money to ship i bought it because it s not very expensive and free shipping  it s very good quality and not so so big   only thing is you can t fold it  i hope that amazon fixed their search suggestions after i had to return this one with the related comments  br   my wife loved it and has a similar but older model drier that still works   for 5 years  i think   br    br   anyway  i was looking for 220 volt drier and had to return this one in the end i gave it for stars because it is noisy  i didn t use it very much on my last trip  but it came in handy for drying clothes in a humid climate  it s also handy if someone is in the bathroom and you can t use the hotel hair dryer  for the price  it s worth keeping one in my suitcase  the dryer works very well   dries hair quickly  like the choice of settings  it is rather large so not suitable for travel i was surprised to find that the  item was not as quiet as claimed   that was the feature i was looking for  i love this hair dryer so much that i purchased two more to give to my daughters for xmas  it is the most powerful hair dryer available with 2000 watts   it s a professional dryer with a low price  i like the price  the compactness of it     and it is easy to travel with   i would definitely recommend it to my friends  shipped super quick   the speeds in the dryer are extremely convenient esp love the cooling button has no heat at all unlike many dryers tht even with the cooling button  the air is still sort of warm this hairdryer works particularly well for my fine hair in that it does not   34 overcook  34  it as there are multiple settings to choose from  you can choose from 3 heat settings as well as 3 force settings  and lastly there is a   34 cool shot of air  34  setting  all of these options have allowed my frequently highlighted hair to remain somewhat healthy looking as opposed to the blowdryers that use maximum heat all the time  i would definitely recommend  the entire body of this dryer is a matte  somewhat grippy plastic  really smart feature  br    br   everything else is fine  buttons  weight  loudness  no issues at all  it dries hair and doesn t blow out eardrums or melt cartilage  br    br   can t write about the long term reliability  because i ve only had it for a couple of weeks  so far  so good  the hardest part of having your old hair dryer die on you is getting used to a new one  br   this hair dryer is fabulous and so quiet compared to my old one  i was actually surprised   my hairdresser recommended a home unit since i like to sit under her hairdryer and read   a great treat at home  it is easy to use and works great   i have been using since it came and it works as described  fast blow drying travel size  lightweight and great price  what more could i need  i am a  professional hair stylist  but i use this for personal drying  works or me  i liked the price of this hairdryer  it was great during the first 2 weeks but then it blew off and stopped  even better than the revlon version i had before  controls are easier to use and it isn t too heavy in my hands  the only reason i gave it 4 stars was because i had a better hair dryer  which isn t fair because i paid double the price for it   i bought it before moving to london for its dual voltage capabilities  it s quite lovely with its folding handle and its cord keeper  i have owned a few of these before  same style and model  they are very dependable  i love having them mounted on the wall in the bathroom  it makes my hair straight  i love it  the smaller nozzel focuses the heat where i want it  strong and powerful  best hair dryer ever  it reduces my drying time from almost 1 hour 30 minutes to just 45 minutes  eliminating all frizz  this hair dryer works extremely well and folds and stores neatly in a drawer  the retractable cord is easy to use with just a push of the button  i was very excited when i saw the t3 featherweight hair dryer featured on one of the morning shows   lightweight  doesn t dry out hair   i m in   i have had the dryer for less than 6 months and the motor has already burnt out  br    br   ladies  and gentlemen   this hair dryer is a featherweight because it doesn t have much power and the motor is less than optimal   i would go back to my  30 conair anyday after spending over  100 on this hair dryer  br    br   save your money and purchase good hair produces  this is a great hair dryer    if you want to dry your wet hair quickly  dont be heisted  choose this  i love how light weight this hair dryer is  and how quick it gets my hair dry   i have curly hair and it does not make it frizz   love it  great product  arrived on time as it said it would no complaints          0        this one taught me the error of my ways   power  drying much better   sturdy construction and really nice texture  too   won t slide off the counter   very much worth a bit more money to get a quality piece of equipment  i have used this dryer several times   i like the settings and also the fact that it isn t too heavy for it s size   also  the price was right and it had other good reviews  this hair dryer seems to work well for all hair types  it blows hot and helps with coarse or unruly hair types  when my 25 year old hairdryer bit the dust  i needed a new one quickly  br   this fit my budget and works  but is not as powerful as my other one  br   i have short hair so it is not a problem  but for long hair i don t think it has enough heat  when i ordered this styler i thought i was getting the  older  one that folds  the two models look very similar   i would think they are the same unless i look very closely at the picture  the reason why i was getting an extra one was because i was very satisfied with the old model   light  small  dual voltage  strong  br    br   this newer model works the same and looks the same  it just doesn t fold  the folding one is actually  imho  easier to bring when traveling  i have been ordering andis wall dryers for a while  this one was smaller than the one i had before  which is good in a small bathroom  i m very pleased with the temperature and ease of using  love love love this item  the heat control is amazing  dries my very curly hair extremely fast   leaves it soft and shiny  a must have  i put this in a rental condo and it is terrific  the led night light is a wonderful feature to the unit  great for at home or salon used  i gave it as a present to one of my clients that needed a dryer  it works perfect   it is a really cheap product  it is lake a professional hair dryer  with ac motor  2200 w and tourmalina  the dryer works great  bought this as a present for my wife  had a rough time assembling it b c the screws supplied didn t fit or screw nicely in the holes provided for the base  i quick trip to the hardware store to buy some better fitting screws seemed to do the trick nicely  br   other than that everything was as expected  expensive  yes  but very much worth it  after my last hair dryer croaked i read many reviews and ordered the highly rated revlon tourmaline ionic hair dryer  that one actually took curl and body out of my hair and left it limp and hard to style  so i went hunting for a non ionic dryer and chose this one  not at all sure i was happy paying  75 for a hair dryer  but i am indeed happy and would gladly buy it again  styles my hair nicely with no frizz  i ve used it for more than 3 years and it still works perfectly  the only flaw is some bare spots where the color scratched off in putting the dryer in and out of a drawer  not that i care one whit about the paint job on my hair dryer  i ve rated it four stars rather than five simply because it s large  too small for rollers  but great for conditioning  gloss  semi permanent color  etc   bonnet is the size of 3 layer cake   short hose  but that saves fan power and weight   consider spending more if planning regular use  easy to use  it is quiet and soft  not burn your hair  cool dryer option is also great to use  great look  works perfectly  i don t have any problem with the heavy weight as some users would complain about  however the first time i turned it on i did smell something burning  but it only happended once  i use this hair dryer everytime as i wash my hair  about once a day  so far so good and i m happy about the purchase  this is not a quiet hair dryer though  but i don t think it s a big deal since almost all the dryers are noisy anyway  this dryer works well for drying my hair type   it adjusts perfectly when sitting and it stores very nicely away works well and the color is better then shown more like neon green   definitely a good purchase   gave as a gift its good  but for some reason the way the buttons are everytime i grab the dryer to plug it in ive hit the on button and it always is on when plugged in  beyond that its no big deal  and it dries nice and is cute looking  i love the colors   also i have pretty long hair and this dries pretty quickly which i love  i purchased this as a christmas gift for my wife   she s a stylist  so i took a chance that she wouldn t like it  but she loved it and replaced her old hairdryer with this one  the dryer is quiet and calm running  the bonnet is is just the right fit with or without rollers   it has a nice handsome look   it is sturdy and strong  br    br   great temper control the timer has a slight ticking sound  and the bell rings when time is up awesome  coasters are convent and easily moves where you want it   perfect for a home beauty aid  would recommend to all looking for a home style salon look  i brought this dryer from walmart it was 25 with shipping   anywho this is the best for deep conditioning  even though the back doesnt get that hot as the front its very warm  so far i love this product  i had my old ge wall type hair dryer for 13 years   sadly it passed away   i had the old metal bracket on the wall and thought   34 if only i could get the same dryer to fit the old bracket   i wasn t eager to start filling the holes and repainting the spot and maybe the whole bathroom if i couldn t match the wall color  br   yippee   i ordered one that looked similar and attached over the old bracket  br   the new dryer is perfect  i was able to quickly blow dry my hair   the combs were able to glide through my thick hair quickly   i m so glad i purchased this blow dryer  used one of these in a hotel and liked it so much we came home and ordered one   it was delivered quickly and in great condition  i was very pleased with the shipping and packaging  i like the temperature settings  the way it folds and how the cord retracts inside  mostly pleased with the handle for holding it while drying my hair  some dryers don t feel like they are correctly made for holding  this one does  i would recomend this hair dryer to everyone  thanks  i love the turbo blow dryer its the best the price is totally woth buying   d it works wonders     this is a good hair dryer for me  it has 3 settings  and a cooler button that blows cool air if it gets too hot  christmas present  wife is pleased  what more can i say  it seems like a well made quality item  nuff  said  my daughter in law picked this gift to her wish list for christmas  we bought it  and it is working very well  just get it  o o that s how good it is     no words can explain how well this thing works  i love mine  had my eyes on it for years now and now that i have it     i m very pleased and glad that i bought it  works great  but there is too much noise  i bought it for my girl friend and she loves it very much  i love this hair dryer   it drys my hair real fast and it is easy to store with the folding handle it does a great job and is up and out ot the way it automatically turns  off which is great awesome great hair dryer  it gets the job done really fast however the only qualm i have is that the cord is only three foot long  i bought this for a friend for christmas  she really likes it because it very light and the temperature controls move easily  ok but heavey br   nice does its job but looks small was supprized how heavey it was  br   has all the heat adjustmentas i was looking for i liked the hair dryer but after less than 2 years the heat stopped working  the retractable cord didn t really work so well after the first few months  you had to push it in  easy to use dry your hair fast easy to carried is light weight   you can take it anywhere in that house i usually watch tv while my hair is getting dry    1 26 2013   asin b000ig83ve babyliss pro babfrv2 volare ferrari designed professional luxury mid sized hair dryer  red  2000 watts   br    br   this hair dryer is the best but the 2 nozzle did not come in my package    this has me worry that the product may not be new  i needed an inexpensive hairdryer  when it arrived  it was not as large as i thought it would be   that s a good thing when you re tight on storage space  i would say this is a mid size hairdryer  not the full gigantic salon sized version nor the mini travel version  it doesn t seem too noisy when on and the volume of air it blows is pretty decent  br    br   the overall construction is as you would expect for the price   a glossy smooth plastic outer shell surrounding the internal heating electrical mechanical workings  the switch is easy to manipulate into the desired setting  down for low and up for high  the cool shot button allows the hairdryer to ramp up into the high mode but blow out cool air  the filter cover on the end of the hairdryer is easy to remove by twisting off  i prefer this type of filter cover over the hinged version that you cannot run under the sink for a good cleaning  if you ever rinse the filter cover  make sure it is absolutely dry before putting it back on the hairdryer as water and electricity do not mix  on the topic of electricity  the hairdryer also features a gfci plug in case your bathroom doesn t have a gfci outlet  this feature trips the power off to your hairdryer in case it comes into contact with water  preventing electrocution  br    br   the weight is decent and lightweight  not too heavy to hold while drying your hair  the handle could be a bit more comfortable  but for the money i cannot complain that much  br    br   i don t know about durability  but i think it was a decent purchase and very utilitarian  i used a small 10 dollar travel hair dryer for 2 years as my main dryer   it took soo long to dry my long hair   with this dryer  it s dry in 2 minutes not even  it s so strong  but i love being able to set the heat several ways   very customizable   the cord is amazing  it stays inside the dryer and out of my way when it s not in use   i also love the color   it s not as pink as it looks in the picture  it s more marroon but  still pretty   i highly recomend  i love it and use is very convenient br    this product is valuable  and the price is not expensive  worth buying  we have four of these now  they are great product and work as described  would recommend to friends  would order again  this is a great help in drying and styling my hair since arthritis severely limits the range of motion in my shoulders  it takes a little getting used to as you move your head and brush instead of the dryer  but that only takes one or two uses  the stand might be the only ineffective part  i am still having a hard time screwing in the wheels to the stand as i feel they are not compatible  i cant tell you how the rest works because i am still having issues with the stand  br    br   okay so i finally fixed the wheels  my way  and was able to use it with no difficulty  the product worked very well and heats well  i would recommend if this is a starter dryer for someone  i love this blow dryer  i was tired of taking 5 minutes to blow dry my thick hair so i went on a search for something that would be faster  so many say they blow dry faster but this one really does  so glad i purchased this  i no longer dread blow drying  light weight  easy to manage does a great job   mom is 90 years old and this unit is perfect for her needs  excellent dryer easy to put together  controls are awesome all you need is one tool included with the dryer  br    br   roy  woodbridge  va while staying in a motel i used this and fell in love  my hair comes out smoother   love the multiple settings   this works so well i purchased a second for when my new one wears out    good blow dryers are hard to come by  works great  stylish and is a great gift for anybody who tends to take care of their hair a lot  package came right on time  in good condition and holds its worth  great hairdryer  i love the multi settings to dry your hair and it was exactly what i was looking for as a gift for my daughter   she wanted the ion tool so it was perfect for her  thanks  hari dryer was exactly as described   very quick delivery for xmas runs grevery happyat would recomend for purchase very happy i used an andis 1875 hair dryer in a hotel and loved it but when i ordered it online  i got a different product   the product i got is an andis 1875 but it isn t the same   i m disappointed in the one i got because it s not as powerful as the one at the hotel  excelent product good quality  the shipping excelent  and the description is really like the publication  i am happy with my order and everything is excelent we have one already just like it and the wife loves it and that is why we bought another one a bargain our old one is 6 years old and we are ready for the new one  this product dries hair efficiently and quickly  it includes 2 heat settings and a cool boost button just like the more expensive models  my daughter bought this hairdryer first and i kept borrowing hers  finially decided to buy my own and i am very happy with the dryer  it is a light weight and packs a lot of pwer  goes from hot to cold in seconds  i am very happy with the hairdryer and hope it lasts for years  light weight with great power  br   it has great heat and i would recommend br   to friends and family  thank you conair  i had my previous vidal sassoon hair dryer for a very long time   my own stupidity was actually its undoing  i tried to clean off the grate inside by opening the unit and ended up not putting it back together quite right  burning out the motor  soooo i had to get another hair dryer   i decided on this one for the price and ratings for the most part  it is heavier probably because of the ceramic inside  i only use it to quickly dry my short hair after a shower so it works great for that  i probably got more than i need in a hair dryer but it does work for me and it works swell  it is the bees knees  don t know what that means exactly and i am younger than that saying is    but it is kinda fun saying it anyway  it looks like the sunbeam 1200 model that we have had forever    that is found in most hotel rooms  but not near as good   the dryer doesn t snap in like it should  the only reason why i give it 4 stars is that the handle is not foldable  but for this price who cares  it functions well as a machine that blows hot air out  you know the plug is just to big for most of the outlets  hangs down too much and hits the counter tops   good power though works great  exactly what i expected  love the retractable cord  and it has enough power to dry my hair quickly  this item arrived quickly and just as advertised  i love it     it dries my thick hair in a flash  try it  it s absolutely amazing   my wife claims she never knew a blow dryer could make such a change in the way you style your hair   worth the price  this hairdryer is very nice  i have full thick hair and it will have it mostly dry in about 2 minutes  i have also managed to drop it about 20 times since i got it and its still running like a  champ  worked great the first 4 months and then died unexpectedly without warning   not pleased   would have expected to get at least a year out of it  so far very happy with the performance of this dryer  my daughter said it really helps minimize the frizzies you get with some hair dryers  i m hopeful it will last at least a year or two  so many hair dryers quit before you have gotten your money s worth  this was a great dryer while it lasted   i loved all the different settings because i could use it on my small dod with no problems   it did dry hair faster   after 2 years the electric safety plug blew and the hairdryer is bricked  br    br   i just bought another cheaper andis and see it has a 5 year warranty   if this one had a 5 year warranty too i wish someone had said or posted something or wish i saw it if it was listed on the box if it was offered   if you notice this ad makes no mention of warranty  br    br   this was a good but heavy dryer while it lasted   2 lbs i think   i liked the range in heat and speed of airflow much better than what i replaced this with   the variety in heat and speed worked out perfect for the dog and me   my dog preferred the low warm or hot while i preferred fast and hot   the weight of the dryer didn t bother me at all  br    br   did i gyp myself out of warranty on this dryer   i sure hope not because i already threw it away     this blow dyer rocks  effective  for brand name is affordable  what i like most about it  it is super quite  yet very powerful  this is a goo product   hair dresser recommended and uses one   not sure how the pearl effect is supposed to sustain itself from the ceramic but oh well   it does what it s supposed to do and i would recommend this to anyone looking for  a quality hair drier   it was deliverd quickly and was packaged to arrive safely  my daughter loves this dryer  she enjoys using all the attachments and says it dries her long hair very quickly  high powered and compact  it is the perfect little travel blow dryer   i also love the little attachable defuser and straightener   way too cute and works amazingly well  i bought two of this because my sisters  enrolled in a beauty salon school  and they tell me it is truly amazing  just keep in mind that this is a professional dryer  and if used without caution  it may burn some ones hair  because it is that powerful  conair yb075w pro yellowbird is really most excellent  this hair dryer is sturdy and well built  definitely worth the money  this is the best hair dryer i have ever purchased  dries my hair quickly and does not make a lot of noise  bought this dryer a year ago for under  40 hoping it would be better than most regular  20 ones  it didn t disappoint  i actually loved it  i also thought it was very quite even on the highest speed  the heat is so hot it dried fast   it s not light weight but since it dries my really thick hair quickly that was not a problem  everything was going great till my mom and cousin used it one day and suddenly when i turned it on it went out     everything worked fine but the high energy speed   it stayed on medium despite pressing the button to switch it  i was really dispointed   with my thick hair and a baby on the way  i was not going to keep using it on medium speed  it would take me double the time to dry my hair    so i returned the damaged one and replaced it with a brand new one  that was my only option with my local store  this new one better last more than a year  even though it is the same wattage it does not seem to have any power   i am sure that it is every dryer the blow dryer i had since high school finally died so i bought a new one  there s nothing special about this hair dryer  but there s definitely nothing wrong with it  nice  powerful stream of air with the option of cooler air  hotter air   and high and low power  it works quickly on my fine hair and on my daughter s thicker hair  it made my hair look very smooth and the retractable cord is really great  just what i was looking for  i have bought it for my wife  she loved it  she does not has to go work with wet hair anymore  d  i recommend it  love this dryer  i have had it for a long time now  works like new  it is a hair dryer   what can i say   it is what i wanted for the price   i am happy with it  my friend got this from me as a b day gift  she is absolutely happy  she takes it everywhere she travels  i love this dryer  my hair is really thick after i wash it and this dryer makes my hair feel softer  because it s an ionic dryer  and more manageable  i didnt give it 5 stars because it is a little heavy to operate and the attachment comb that it comes with is a little long for me but still works great  it was worth every penny  i wish i had heard about this sooner  the review was great  high power     great heat  would reccomend this product to all  perfect wall mount hair dryer   quiet and easy to install  i liked this hair dryer for a lot of reasons  the retractable cord is nice  but i had to struggle with it numerous times  unfortunately my unit stopped working after about 15 months after purchasing  i love this hairdryer  im no professional but it does the job and its affordable  i would recommend it to anyone  bought this for my daughter  very good buy  put in cart and went back to buy and it was even cheaper what s the difference between a man s hair dryer and a woman s   i have no idea   i would think a man s hair dryer would have 2 settings  off and on   this one has a combination of settings and i have no idea what their purposes are   it will blow air of varying heats at varying speeds  if that appeals to you   i tend to just use hot and high   i m not real sure about the ions but it all sounds very scientific so i just leave that on  br    br   at any rate  i ve had it for a couple of months now and have had no problems with it   it really does blast the heat  and air too  so drying is pretty quick   the little detachable nozzle is nice too  as leaving it on focuses the air better  but i took it off once when i need to work some duckback oilskin treatment into my oilskin coat  no  really    this calls for a more even application of heat so the ability to remove the nozzle was actually handy  br    br   overall i can t imagine how it could be better  br    br   i suppose it could dispense donuts but i can t really dock them a star for that oversight  i guess  this hair dryer is much more quiet than my previous hairdryer  which was an adjustable ionic hairdryer   it has this interesting grippy material around the outside which is very attractive and comfortable to hold   it is lightweight and has three temperature and three speed settings  i don t think it gets super hot  which is good for me since i have fine hair and do not wish to dry it out   my hair was incredibly soft after using this dryer  i love being able to have a salon quality style from home   this little hair dryer works a treat to bring out the best curl   but the hose has ripped and torn in three places so far   i have had to duct tape the hose together   i would recommend discovering if another product has a better quality hose before purchasing  this hair dryer is worth the price   it drys my hair much faster then my chi ever did and the cuticle on my hair stays down more so i don t have the fly away look   my hairdresser recommended this hair dryer  soory to have to say i bought this for a christmas gift for a little girl  as far as i know  it has been fine  i gave this a 4 star rating because this hair dryer offer s everything you need in one  it has numerous speeds and heat settings  gives out more than enough heat also  the cord retracts and then the hair dryer can be folder for traveling  it has all the necessary attachments also  i ve had one myself for 2 yrs  and love it  i bought 2 more for my granddaughter and daughter for christmas gifts as they requested a hair dryer  i ve tried a lot and this one is the best for me  i would have given it 5 stars  but i think the cord could be just a little longer  this dryer does a good job and wasn t too expensive  it has several different settings available   i am pleased with this purchase  after our old dryer bit the dust  i wanted to replace it with one that worked just as well  but also quieter  lighter  and had more features   from reading the specs and reviews on this andis 82005 dryer  i felt this one fit the bill  but after using it for a week  i have mixed feelings  here is why  br    br   pros  br   1  sleek looking  so what  nice  but doesn t make your hair look any nicer  br   2  nice variety of attachments that stay attached nicely  br   3  long 10 ft  cord  if you need that  however i don t  and it really only gets in the way  br   4  hang loop br   5  dries hair fairly quickly  with ion technology  br   6  outside stays cool to touch br    br   cons  br   1  heavier than the last two dryers we ve had  hot tools tourmaline lite 1043     see my review on that one  and chi low emf dryer   br   2  dries hair no faster than the two abovementioned ionic dryers br   3  not quiet  in fact  louder than the two abovementioned dryers   br   4  not enough speed heat settings  not much difference in heat settings  although speed settings are adequate  br   5  comb attachment actually hurts your scalp  feels very scratchy  due to squared ends of the teeth  br   6  shiny silver colored exterior shows prints  etc  much more than others  br    br   all in all  not a bad dryer    i guess i expected more  but i would probably go with another one next time  will always buy t3 hairdryers from now on    best investment  this hairdryer is amazing    and now cheaper since it s not the most current version  i can t imagine a better hairdryer  dries my hair super fast  and the dryer itself is super light  i bought this for my mom and little sister s home  as one of their christmas gifts this year  because they haven t had a blowdryer in the house for years now  they said they love it  it s a simple blowdryer with a high heat so it dries the hair fast  overall it s easy to use but doesn t come with any special perks  but guaranteed if you don t have one now it s better than what you have  this hairdryer is the lightest and quietest i ve ever used   in fact  my husband now wants one of his own  we picked a wall mount because she was always leaving her hair dryer plugged in  right next to the sink  that s a terrible accident just waiting to happen    after trying unsuccessfully to get her to unplug it and put it away  i realized her life would be a whole lot easier if i just got her a wall mount hair dryer and deliberately mount it next to where she stands in front of the sink rather than mount it right next to the sink itself   that solves a lot of problems  she doesn t have to use up drawer space for the dryer  i don t have to worry about her putting it away hot  it is always plugged in and ready  the coil cord never drags over the sink  so nothing getting knocked off the sink   and of course the risk of the dryer falling into the sink is practically eliminated  br    br   this hair dryer is conveniently small so it s easy to handle  even for a young teen with long hair   it dries hair quickly because it is powerful despite its size  br    br   wall mounting was trivially simple    it took less than five minutes with my hand dandy drill driver  bits  level  and a hand screwdriver  it is much better to use a manual screwdriver instead of a drill driver to screw into wall anchors    it comes with a wall template with a leveling line which makes the job go especially quickly  there are many reviews for this dryer  and in a nut shell  it works very well and does the job  i have two small complaints  but one of them is a big deal for me  i have medium textured straight hair that is very  very long  i like to use the medium heat setting for blow drying my hair for less damage but this dryers medium heat  is almost room temperature  it s not quite hot enough and therefore takes about 50  longer than my old dryer to get the job done  br    br   pros  br    nice feel in the hand br    nice frizz flyaway control br    low and high air flow br    3 temp  settings br    comes with diffuser br    br   cons  br    medium heat is too cool causing long drying time br    the precision diffuser knocks off the dryer fairly easily with an accidental tap of the brush  or wrapping of the chord br    br   i don t think i d buy the same one again  but really  it s just a hair dryer  this hair dryer is amazing   just like the one they use in my salon  and it costs so much less   this is my second one as i loved my first one so much  when it died i bought the same thing  i ve had this hair dryer for 9 months and use it daily  but now am ready to give up on it and try a different brand  in the beginning  it worked pretty good  but it didn t take long for things to stop working correctly  today was the final straw  after blow drying my hair this morning  it smells burnt  i m getting rid of this thing before it starts a fire  br    br   pros br    comes with lots of accessories br    dries hair quickly br    back opens so that dust filter can be cleaned br    br   cons br    cool button stopped working after a few months br    loud br    risk of fire burnt hair br    did not last long i bought this blow dryer because my friend had one and loved it  well  i love mine too  this dryer will dry your hair quickly without causing damage  it also reduces frizz really well  especially when used with a round brush  they sell this exact same hair dryer at the salon where i get my hair cut    at three times the price    i would highly recommend  this is a great deal  not as powerful as i had hoped and the filter keeps falling off the back   otherwise  works okay   retractable cord is nice  conair has established their product quality so i cant coment much on the machine its self   i got it at a great price and so i give it 4 stars  very respectable  so far it still works   not too much i can say to help you with your decision  easy to install  nice nightlight   don t use the template   remove and use the plate to determine the location for screw holes  this blow dryer is awesome  beautiful  the body of the dryer is nice a soft  nice material used on it  and this dryer works very well  it s just so sleek and fun to use  i would give it 10 stars if i could  i bought this hair dryer for my girlfriend  she has long thick hair and gets tired of all the maintenance it takes  she has been very happy with this product  it works quickly and doesn t damage her hair  this is a very nice hair dryer  the fan blows very strong  the heat is good  and the item is solid  next best thing to being at the hair salon   have not had a chance to use much  but worked great the 2 times i used   great way to save counter space  well constucted hair dryer  high speed is fast and hot  makes for a quick dry  light  compact and dries my hair really fast  that s exactly what i needed for day to day use and for travel  i was looking for an ionic drier because of how quick it manages my medium length hair  i wasn t worried about compact or travel  br    br   it feels heavy enough to be quality  but not too heavy to use  the settings are good  although i expected a little more power from the high blower setting   but with the ionic tech it doesn t need to blow harder  br    br   the cool blast button doesn t react as quickly as turning the heat setting to low  br    br   for function  it s perfectly fine  no complaints with function  br    br   the only thing i don t like which is a   34 feature  34   is the soft matte finish   it s pretty when it s new  but it gets scuffed and smudged with styling products and isn t pretty   i m not one to clean my styling appliances so often but this one needs a wipe down more often than not  it s not terrible  but i don t like it  and it wasn t an issue with my former drier  br    br   there are so many products out there which are comparable  it s really hard to decide  i m not  super excited   but i m happy  this was a gift for my sister  and it was a great buy for the price  a very well made hair dryer  love it   it really works really well and is compact and light  it heats ups fast and gets the job done thanks this is an item that my girlfriend requested on her wishlist  and i got it for her  she loves it  and apparently it is amazing  i am bald now  so i have no need for such things  but it s nice to know i bought her something that is great at drying the hair one might have  our old conair started making noises about a month ago so we bought this thinking we would need it some morning   the old one is still running  with a little noise  but it is the earlier version of this one and we have been happy with it  man  let me tell ya  this thing really blows  and i mean that in a good way  br   buy one  it will blow you away  lol really love it  have been using it for two months and it works great  the price is awesome   7 79 with free shipping using prime  light weight  quiet sound and fast speed to dry my hair  can t find any problem with it  highly recommend  i got this during the black friday madness and love it  it has all the tips and ends anyone would need  great buy  i like it   work very good i will recommend it yo my friends i m sure they will love it like me   good price  is a shame that we have 240 volt in australia and i had to buy a stepdown transformer wich made it more expansive  this is a great product  it is really simple to hang  works well  and keeps the countertops clutter free  we have been so happy with it  we ve purchased the sunbeam one each time    years in between   it lasts well  product of very good quality  impeccable wine    recommend the truth    i hope to continue buying     100  original product    i read several good reviews on this product and purchased it immediately  br   it works great  my wife is very satisfied with this hair dryer  br   i am considering buying a second one for my daughter  pros   doesn t over dry hair to a crisp  love the settings and switch options and easy one handed access when changing modes  my two hair stylists bought one because they liked mine so much and the great price  br    br   cons   my first model broke after 14 months  i only use it 3 4 times a week  the heating element died  my husband is a electrical engineer and took it apart and couldn t fix it  it feels like a waste to throw such a nice blow dryer away  but i liked it enough to by another one of the same model  just hope it lasts longer  fast  doesn t burn  doesn t weaken over time  love it  my grandmother is a professional hair dresser and she recommended this for personal  at home use due to a good blend of price and quality  this blow dryer is ok   first of all  it s a little larger than i thought   a little louder than my conair 1875 watt dryer   i prefer the conair but kept this as a spare  extremely lightweight yet dries hair in record time  leaving it with a wonderful shine   also much quieter than my previous blowdryer  which is an added bonus  this hair dryer works just fine but it was not as compact as i expected it to be  br    br   it seems that with the ability for the cord to retract  they had to make the handle part fatter   for someone with smaller hands  it s a bit more effort to hold the dryer up   and on top of that  the dryer is pretty heavy which makes it even harder to hold it up straight for an extended time  br    br   if you are smaller built and want things small and light  then this may not be the dryer for you  when my granddaughter first used it she said it was broke   doing better using it now since we taught her not to hold so close to her head  i received this as a gift and love it   i have naturally curly hair and live in an area of high humidity   this dryer dries my hair and leaves it smooth rather than fly away  dryer is tiny and comes with a travel bag including 2 attachments  the handle does not fold  it s a real nice product overall  it was awesome   i love the blow dry its amazing   very happy with it    yayyyyyyyyyy my hair is ffaaaabbbuulloooouusss   im like a professional hairdresser with this tool   my last hairdryer was really loud so although i expected this one to be more quiet than it is  it is still not as loud as my last one  it has the same power as my last one but really seems to dry faster  i love it  it works great and i would give it 5 stars if it was quieter  i bought this because my boyfriend didn t have one and i m not used to air drying my hair when i shower at his place  he also needed one to dry off his dogs after washing them  i did my research and this one had great reviews and was the cheapest  i thought the item would be bigger but to my surprise it was a portable size so that was even better  the low setting is too low for me and drying my hair on the high setting was perfect  it even has a removable cap on the back for you to clean  for the price i paid  it definitely does its job and dried my hair quick  i would highly recommend this product to anyone  my wife had one of these for years and it finaly quit br   bought this one and she loves it  she loves it i love it got this for my mom  her old hair dryer stopped  she loves this one  and when it is on hot  it is hot saw one in vegas hotel  had to have one   retractable cord is awesome if you re one to store dryer after each use  my sister in law is hairdresser and bought me one for my 35th bday  after 10 years of using it every day it finally quit  i have very long and thick hair and this is the best hair dryer since it dries my hair quickly  i went online to amazon to buy a new one and am thrilled  would never go back to cheap dryer that hardly works again  you have to go turbo   you ll be very happy you did  this blow dryer is the absolute best i have ever owned     my niece asked for one as a christmas gift after using mine   there simply is no better blow dryer out there  and i have tried them all    i love it because it retracts and folds  its not that heavy that you can bring it with you when you travel  my hair dries quickly  i gave a 4 stars because the dryer is not that hot  high heat setting is practically automatic  don t have to wait for it to heat up    and the blower on the high setting is very powerful   this unit is even better than the ones we ve used at hotels   highly recommend  this dryer was really heavy  br   it hurts my arm when i drying my long hair  br   so i am using with dryer stand  br   the strength is good and sometimes it sparks  br   cheap and cute  that s it   my daughter had used this dryer in a hotel while traveling for work   she loved it   it was at the top of her christmas wish list  so it was one of the most appreciated gifts she received   she assures me it is the best dryer she has ever used  i bought two of these for ourrental beach cottage so renters wouldn t have to use up space   i just bought a third one   i ve used it myself while staying at the beach cottage and it s great   this definitely cuts down your drying time and it leaves your hair soft   friz free  the only thing i would change is making the prongs on the diffuser longer to work better   other than that   it s perfect  the product is great but it looked like it was just thrown in the box for mailing   no registration information and no product information was included   maybe shouln t have ordered it around xmas time  i selected this modeal as i had a previous model of this same hair dryer that finally failed after a few years of good service   i purchsed the model 134r and it fit on the previous model s base plate  so i did not have to re mount to the wall   the light is now a led version  which saves power but but puts out much less light than the older model  so it is not really suitable as a night light for the bathroom as the older model was  otherwise i would have given 5 stars    the dual dryer settings are useful and the high setting is quite powerful  plenty for ay hair type in my opinoin  it is a noisy unit and can get quite warm  but performs as i expected  overall  a good value for the money  great  convenient product  my husband had one and it lasted for years  he looked all over for another one  and was really happy to find this one that would fit in his small bathroom  i bought this dryer after using my mom s similar dryer and reading the reviews for this one  i totally love it  i have very thick long hair and it took close to an hour to fully blow dry my hair with my old conair dryer  this one dried my hair in literally about 5 minutes  it is also very light  i wish it was a tax quieter but overall i am more than pleased with my purchase  this hair dryer gets hot  i love the controls   separate for temp and power  i love the removable filter  i ve had it for about 2 years and used it on the hottest setting daily  i haven t had any more hair breakage than the next person  several stylists have complemented me over the years on the health of my hair  however  like these other ladies  my hair dryer just blew up in my face as i was using it  sparks flew out where the cord meets the handle    it s dead  every hair dryer i ve ever had dies like this eventually   looking for one as good as this that won t blow up or catch fire though  really good  and i like the adjustable features of the dryer  i m pleased overall  i d buy if i were you  for the money you can t beat it  plus it comes with attachments   i would definitely buy this if you are looking for a new blow dryer and not interested in spending too much money  no side vents  so the top of your head is dry first and becomes unbearably hot  while the sides and back are still wet   on high  it s very loud  best hotel dryer i have ever used   i travel a lot    so i purchased one for myself   love it   i have had no problems in the year  that i ve had it  my daughter confiscated my older travel hair dryer so i decided to replace it with this one   maybe i should thank her because this dryer is far superior to my other one   even though it s only 1600w  it puts out a lot of air and my hair dries in no time   i love the fact that it s a lower wattage as many older hotels throughout europe can t handle anything higher   how do i know   i purchased an 1800w dual voltage one time and managed to blow out half the circuits in an old hotel in venice  i gave it as a christmas present  it looks pretty nice  but she didn t like it and asked me to exchange it for something else  she liked the look of it  confirmed it is less noisy than normal hair dryers  but simply took longer than normal hair dryer for her long hair  not as powerful as expected  but the fact that you can fold it really helps  not the greatest but okay i used one similiar to this in a hotel and loved it  so i ordered me one  this is a great product and i would reccomend this product       a  a  a   i have very long thick hair that is mid way down my back   my old hair dryer last several years but finally died   i decided on this one because of the reviews and the color  i admit it   br    br   the color is beautiful   it is the most  pretty  hair dryer that i have ever owned  br    br   the retractable cord is a must for me   this is an awesome feature that i will not go without   it makes it possible for easier storage and you don t have to worry about the cord getting tangled  ripped  etc  br    br   the heating settings are very standard and work very well  br    br     the only issue for me is the power  or lack thereof   br   the highest setting has about the same amount of power as the lowest setting on my old hair dryer    my old dryer had the same amount of watts as this one    due to this  it takes much more time to dry my hair than i am used to   however  if you have short hair this iron might be perfect for you  this hair dryer is fantastic and quite strong for being so small   the best part is the dual voltage feature  it works wherever you travel  this ranked second in dryers in my price range  the first was cited as easy to accidentally change the setting  i love this dryer  works fast  strong flow  retractable cord is a plus  hand weight is comfortable  have had this for a little over a year now   it is extremely lightweight and feels very good quality   plenty of different settings and all of them work well   good airflow and it is plenty hot or cool enough  initially i really liked this hair dryer   it worked well and ran quietly  but it suddenly stopped working   while it worked fine yesterday  when i plugged it in this morning it just wouldn t turn on   because i ve owned it less than two months  i ve requested a replacement through amazon to give it another a try  this hairdryer was a really good buy  and my daughter really loved having her own without having to borrow mom s hairdryer every day  it is a nice hairdryer  christmas present for my wife  br   i now know more about hair dryers than i ever hoped to know  but she loves it and that is all that matters  she says it is the best she has ever owned  this hairdryer works well for the price  i would buy it again  hair dries fairly quickly  but the air stream is not that strong  i mention that comes with both attachments in the subject because i was confused when i first bought it i thought it came just with the concentrator not with the diffusor but what was my surprise when i opened the box it came with both which are wonderful  i have curly hair and it worked perfectly on me the product worked well br   i would recommend br   i would buy again br   arrived on time as stated online br   very cost effective you can t get excited over a hair dryer  it works   it dries and thats all it has to do  i got this hair dryer for christmas  and i love it  the retractable cord is perfect for the limited space of my bathroom  the attachments work really well and my hair dries quickly  the only   34 iffy  34  thing about it is it doesn t seem to get as hot as my old dryer  but this may actually be better for my hair  i love love love this hair dryer  i have had it for quite a while  and it has been amazing  great for blowing my hair straight  never burns  and dries very quickly  i bought this product after reading about it in a magazine   i love it   it drys my hair very quickly and without frizz  product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use pretty nice dryer for such a low price  the device works fine for me  and it has many features such as the interruption key for temporally disable the heater and blowing cold air  this hair dryer is the best  its is light weight and it leaves your hair looking beautiful  it has 2 temperatures and 2 speeds whisch really comes in handy  but it has a very short cord which may interfere with your styling ability  for the price it is great    great little hair dryer that gives you what you need without being too huge or expensive   great for small spaces  after gym  people that must travel with a dryer  and i imagine  people with easy to manage hair   this is definitely a no frills  standard  and simple dryer   if you re looking for low maintenance  low budget  easy  this is it  i am a retired hairdresser  for years i have found that revlon blow dryers just keep going  this one is strong enough to get thick hair the heat is needs for a great blow out i have my pro blow dryer but with tweenagers always around  having this for them to use at the house is great and nice to have in the guest bath  very happy with the quality and durabilty  works well and i don t feel like i m damaging my hearing when using it   shipped quickly   stores well and electrical cord recoil is cool  great product  i bought one for a gift and one for myself  easy to use  doesn t get to hot  and lightweight  i would return this but it s been too long  i almost immediately went back to my old dryer after a couple of times  i have since found another dryer on amazon that i just received and it s doing a wonderful job  great product at a great price  provides just the right temperature  and dries very well  have had no issues with it since purchase  highly recommended  this is one of the best hair dryers i have ever used   it is very quiet and light   since it s an ionic it leave your hair smooth and shiny   it s a full size hairdryer but travels very well since it s so lightweight   i would highly recommened it   i have used this for a couple of weeks now and am very pleased with this hair dryer   it was not overly expensive and works very well  quickly drying the hair  i am picky about hairdryers because they always make a very loud sound but i feel like the power and force just isn t there  this conair i have been very happy with it is strong and take an adequate time to dry my hair  if this ever dies  i will buy this same dryer again  have used it for over two months now and love it   easy to install and the cord stays neat on the hook   powerful enough to dry my short and in less than 3 minutes  my main reason for purchasing this was to find something i could hang on the wall for easy access to use daily and to have it stored nicely in our main bathroom when not in use  i did not purchase this on amazon  i purchased from a local sally s after my gold n hot  see my review  died a few weeks after purchase   the attachment to this one seals really well and it dries like a pro   true tourmaline technology  though most dryers say the hair will dry silky and without frizz  this one actually does the trick   most other brands do not   my hair was so straight i really could have just curled it instead of flat ironing   really really nice dryer   great replacement for the junk i thought was a good product  i love this blow dryer  it s so quiet and it does an outstanding job     my friend had lended me hers and i loved it so i went out and purchase one of my own  after using this blow dryer at a renaissance hotel  i was surprised at how soft it made my hair feel with absolutely no frizz   another plus  it also dried my medium textured straight hair very quickly   the retractable cord is very convenient as well as its ability to fold   the included concentrator does a great job of drying your roots fast   i loved this blow dryer so much  i bought my daughter one for her college dorm  and she loves it too   thank you andis  excellent job very satisfied  not too much more to say no problems worked out okie dokie smoky a okay   i have naturally curly hair and this hairdryer plus the diffuser have really brought out my curls  i love it  i use the setting below the high setting and then put it on cooler air as i am finishing up  i leave it a little bit damp  my hair is never frizzy with this hairdryer  the only thing i don t like about this hair dryer is the cord  it is not very long  i would recommend this hair dryer  especially if you have curly hair and like the use the diffuser  the price is not bad as it does include 2 attachments  the diffuser and another one to localize the airflow   i would purchase this again  but another 18 inches of cord would be nice  all i can say about this hair dryer is that my wife loves it  i purchased the very same one around 5 years ago  well  it finally died  but since it was so good  i purchased another one for my wife  she says that it works faster than others she had before  that is comfortable to hold and obviously it last for a very long time  she highly recommend it  powerful  a little heavy  but not bad  i can dry my hair in 10 mins  15 if i want it to look nice  definitely a great tool  very handy for the grooming kit  you can wash up and dry your hair quickly without having to wait long for hair to dry i bought this hair dryer because my old one stopped working   this seems like a good quality buy  certainly for the price  but no professional dryer  i have been using the andis ionic ceramic hair dryer for years   my first one  1600w  gave up the ghost several years ago so i replaced it with their newest model  1875w  at that time  seeing i have had good performance with this dryer i decided to buy a back up  i have had 2 of these for a couple of years  the one that is used by 3 people daily finally went  bought again because its convenient and has decent power  added a third one to my daughters room to free up the bathroom  my sister in law asked for this hairdryer for christmas  very handy for all the travel she does  she is very happy with it  this hair dryer worked great while it lasted   only buy it if you are looking for one that collapses and has a retractable cord for travel   otherwise  you are much better off getting something else this hair dryer is small and easy to handle  but the best thing is the air flow  many hair dryers use the word turbo in their description  but this one truly has turbo air flow  it dries my hair quickly and leaves it shining  i love it     i use it everyday  one of the best blow dryers i have purchased  my hairstyles uses it on her clients  this works great and does the job i need it to do   i m giving it four stars instead of five because of the storage issue   i don t like having to cram the cord and extention to the hood back inside the case each time   i would prefer a slightly larger case that would accomodate everything more easily  bought this hairdryer based on great reviews and so far it s been great  lightweight and comes with a couple attachments for extra shine or curly hair  get s the job done  this hair dryer works great  it has lots of power and dries super fast  a little more bulky than other travel hair dryers but since the cord retracts into the handle  it still fits in my carry bag  i haven t had a dryer with attachments since high school  but this thing is a life saver  i don t have to straighten my hair when i use the small tooth comb and it dries my hair very fast  so much of my time has been saved since i got this wonderful gadget  great product exactly how it is described  you can t beat a revlon blow dryer  it s also very affordable and compact  i have had the same vidal sassoon dryer for years   someone big stepped on the plug which made it unsafe to use   i love this dryer  it s exactly what i ve been using  i m totally satisfied with the purchase    thanks for the quick delivery  i have owned this dryer previously and was looking to acquire a replacement but had wanted to shop this out sinceit is pricey for a hair dryer   phenomenal price and even better delivery time  this dryer is extremely high powered  it is somewhat heavy  but i love the grip of it and its probably slightly heavy because it really is high powered and fast drying i bought my hair dryer about 6 months ago   i wasn t overly impressed with it   it never seemed to get as hot as my previous t3 dryer and didn t smooth my hair like before   the topper came yesterday when the dryer started sparking as i was using it leaving a nice burn on my arm   i thought  90 for this dryer was a deal compared to stores but truth is the dryer isn t worth  9    either t3 is making really cheap products or this is a knock off   buyer beware   nightlight is very bright  beware if bathroom is off the bedroom  you may need to cover it to tone it down  otherwise  the hairdryer is excellent   nice to be able to set power for either 1200 or 1600 watts  recessed switch  takes a tool   then you have high low finger switch  my hairdresser comes to my house and this is absolutely perfect for home use   the temperature is just right and the hood is comfortable  we ordered this as a christmas gift on the recommendation of our stylist   she spoke highly of the product and manufacturer   however  upon opening  the dryer did not work on the high setting   we will need to return it  i had it for a while and i haven t had any problems with it   what more is there to say  speedy shipment  easy ordering  sent just as described  awesome product  my teen aged daughter is loving this hair styler  thanks  took years for me to buy a new hairdryer and i will never wait again to do so   this hairdryer has power  works great  on the quieter side of blow dryers and really does the job  i m a professional hairstylist and have purchased this dryer two times  my old one broke but i use it every day all day and had it for two years  the new one seems improved from last time with a better sturdier power chord  it s super powerful and light and heats up to the perfect temp hot but not overly hot  overall i love it and it makes my job easier  throughout extensive travels  i would find this model in better hotels   resorts and decided to get one for myself   really good  easy to control and direct to exact spots for drying and styling   doesn t have a   34 cool shot  34  button  but i really don t miss it  nice product with a lot of power   i love how the cord reels up inside of the dryer for storage   great buy  weight is good and the air preassure is great too   one small thing i don t like about it is the button location for the temp   my fingers wrap around that part of the handle and they hit that button and change the temp   i would buy again though     this was my 3rd dryer in about 6 months  couldn t seem to find one with the right amount of heat and airflow   this one is perfect  great product for the price  very light  and powerful  you don t have to spend a lot of money for a good hair dryer  you won t be disappointed  one of these is in the employee bathroom at work and i d used it and decided i wanted one at home   i love that it s mounted on the wall and out of the way   works well for what i need  i bought two dryers this is very good   small  compact  easy to carry on any trip  the design is beautiful and best of all  it accepts two voltages  excellent  it works great  i love that it is compact and the cord is retractable  my only complaint is the cord is not very long  my outlet is above my sink in my bathroom so the length of the cord is fine for me there  but if i were using an outlet close to the floor i would not be able to move as freely  this hair dryer is awesome  the price is great and it has serious power on the top settings  you have to be careful not to burn your face  i have short hair and my whole head is dry in under a min on the max settings  looks good and feels nice in your hands  not to heavy  my girlfriend loves it we are enjoying this wall mounted hair dryer very much  it was a gift but we are both enjoying it  bought this for my daughter for christmas and she has been using it to dry her hair ever since   she really likes the hello kitty theme and it functions well  works great   does what it is supposed to do which is dry hair     yes the outer finish starts to peal a little bit around the handle but no big deal    its a blow dryer not a pair of shoes   the cost was great too  this blow dryer is pretty impressive  i ve had it for a few months now and am still happy with it  it dries my hair fast and leaves it smooth  it is actually better than my old  120 blow dryer  definitely recommend  very strong heat and durable product  i use it every day with clients and it works great  looks good too  this blow dryer is cute  but has no air blowing power and barely heats to a warm temperature   i gave up trying to dry my hair  shipped and arrived within estimated time   my husband installed it the same day and found installation very easy   i do have to agree with others that the night light is quite bright   i do partially close the door to our master bath because of the light  since our bathroom is connected to our bedroom   no complaints about using the hair dryer   it is certainly quieter than our other one   would definitely purchase another  this blow dryer is lightweight and powerful   i have thick keratin relaxed hair and it tames my hair beautifully   it gets very hot   which i need   and the airflow is strong   there is a cool shot that helps with sealing in a curl or wave   i would definitely recommend this product  a great product for a great price  i am glad i bought it  it is more than i expected    it is a great hair dryer  my roommate use it every day and very comfortable  it is a very good choice for this price  bought it for my daughter for christmas   it was just what she wanted   it had everything that she wanted and more  i love the compact  lightweight design and 3 different heat settings   cold shot  great for a small apartment  i ve been using this dryer at least once a week for the past 4 months and have had no problems so far  attachment helps focus the air flow and is a nice addition  only complaint so far is that the plug is a bit too smooth  so it s hard to handle when i have hair product on my hands  i bought this from duane reade over 4 years ago  i loved the compact design  it was perfect for my tiny apartment and the cold shot worked well  it served me well for over 4 years before the gfci plug crapped out  a replacement plug head was more expensive than the dryer and would have required some soldering or wire splicing or something  so i gave up on it  totally recomended   hair dries very fast  i just got mine and im pleased using it every day since i got it this hair dryer is attractive and a good hair dryer   my hair can sometimes be frizzy  but with this dryer  i can get it nice and smooth   i dry it all the way and then use the cold blast for smooth hair  it is very noisy  i was looking for a quiet hair dryer  i would recommend to update a description  i have a old hair dryer that is much more quiet the conair 225r comfort touch tourmaline ceramic 1875 watt hair dryer i bought this as a gift for my sister in law for christmas   she hasent opened it yet so not sure how good it is yet  this did a great job   what i loved most was how compact and easy it was to use   i highly recommend  got this to use on my dog who needed to be bathed almost every day   gets the job done quickly which is what i wanted   have owned it for five months and hope that it has a long life  this s the best blow dryer that i have ever used    dries hair quickly and leaves a beautiful shine  also very nice long cord which makes it easy to use  this hair dryer has lots of power   i liked it a lot  i would recommend it  end  finished  done  bye there was a comb that fit my texture of hair perfectly  the only thing is that this baby gets hot  just what i wanted  light weight and the switches to turn it off and on and the intensity are easy for me to use  i have ms and have a hard time with switches  since we moved south  we have had many guests   finally  we decided to just   34 outfit  34  the guest bathroom   all of our friends who use this hair dryer comment about how nice it is   apparently  it s a hit  this drys my hair in five minutes and i have a ton of fine hair  much quieter than my last dryer to the point i wondered if it was working right  works great for over a month now and easy to clean the intake on the end of dust   not too big to store in our vanity drawers  for about  12 you couldn t go wrong  arrived quickly and blows hot air    what more could one want  so much better than e bay  my husband has used the same travel hair dryer for 15 years and had a new dryer on his wish list   he wanted a small  easy to carry dryer   searched amazon and found the perfect gift for him  i hope it is what she wanted      it came very quick and pleased with what i have seen   affordable too  this hair dryer was a waste of money  br    br   the cord is far too short for proper styling unless you are standing within 2 feet of power socket  br    br   the warm setting is cool br    br   on the hot setting only the inner part of the dryer blows hot hair and the outer rim is cool air which makes the hot setting basically a warm  br    br   very disappointed  i would pay 15 20 for this as my local cvs  wow  it is huge     and not just huge for a   34 portable  34      i mean huge   now maybe it s because this baby is an 1875 watt job and all our other current and prior hair dryers are 1600 or less   when it is open  it is bigger than any other hair dryer we have ever owned   when it is closed  folded  for   34 travel  34     heh  like this would handily fit in a suitcase  this thing is almost as big as my dopp  shaving bag    fortunately we travel more by ground so we don t worry much about suitcase space  br    br   and  as others have mentioned  the cord does not reel in all the way without help or retries   we can live with that   even once the cord is stored  the cordstop leaves about a foot of cord out   it wasn t a surprise because other reviewers have mentioned this too  br    br   on the plus side it does dry hair quickly   fyi  all the girls in our family have long thick hair  br    br   a very important feature this dryer has    and a major reason i chose it    is that it does have a   34 medium  34  heat setting    most just have high and low  with low being very low    the reason   34 medium  34  is important  especially on a high wattage unit  is that   34 high  34  can blow circuit breakers   if you don t whether you have 20amp service on an outlet  you may really want the medium setting    ever try to get a hotel to reset your breaker while your wife s hair is wet    the   34 medium  34  setting dries hair just fine   the high setting dries hair scary fast  but i m not sure how good that much heat is for your hair in the long run  but it is nice to have when you re in a hurry  br    br   a word of advice about any high wattage appliance with a cord reel   always pull the cord all the way out regardless of how much you need   i don t know if it tells you that in the manual but it s always a good idea because a coiled cord carrying a lot of current will get hot   from staring at this unit  it is possible the hair dryer draws the cold intake air across the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but i wouldn t rely on that  br    br   anyway  this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right the cord reel so they might have thought of that already but i wouldn t rely on that  br    br   anyway  this is a great hair dryer as long as you know before buying about its size and the price is certainly right  the hair dryer itself is light weight and easy to handle   it also dries faster than the average hair dryer   great buy  it s more or less sufficient for my thin hair and semi bald head  but the hottest setting is no more than warm ish   other than that  works well  i love it   it s very compact and lives up to all of the product descriptions   i would buy it again  i received this last week and i love it  the only reason i didn t give it five stars is because assembling it was a little more time consuming than i anticipated  after i put it together the adjustable rod didn t move up and down as smoothly as i would have liked but for the price everything was great  i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a dryer  it gets hot enough and it is very quiet compared to most hair dryers that i have had in the past which is a plus  it is quite large so make sure you have the space to store it if you do purchase it  overall a great product and i m very happy with it  the product is good  working properly  the variable speed switch is defective  it s not going on high  please help     love this blower  it works great  it doesn t have the button issue for me like other reviewers said  i would recommend it  to receive and open it seems of good quality wine in a box well protected  the number of stars not complete because i have not completely exceeds my expectations put this in our bathroom at our oceanfront rental condo  and it works great   nice to be able to offer guests an option instead of them having to bring their own  i have long hair which gets frizzy if i don t use a diffuser with the drying  when i use the diffuser with this dryer  it is not very powerful  works great without it  pretty good for people trying to keep their hair natural without adding chemicals  very quick and has different settings to get hair dried well  it does eactly what it says it would do  i get so many compliments on my  long hair and it takes 10 minutes     easy to use  nice grip  good handle and item reached on time  no hassles and meets my simple needs to dry my hairs after shower  i read the reviews for the many different andis hair dryers and finally decided on this one  it is great  dries my hair quickly without causing it to be fly away and frizzy  great purchase  this is an amazing hair dryer for this money  nice design  comfortable handle  it has exceeded my expectations  love it  this is the second one i bought   my daughter took the first one because she liked it so much   i hope to get a lot of use from it  the hair dryer works good drys hair fast  however when we revived it the retractable cord button didn t work other than that this is one of the strongest hair dryers we ever used  i have had expensive blow dryers but after research on the web  i decided to try this one based on an article about the best blow dryers   at any price   i do like it and think it does a great job on my hair  and i am etremely picky   however the downside is a short cord   i have had to accomodate by drying my hair in the bath vs  my room   the expensive ones have a much longer cord  however  i will get used to it eventually  the price is great but the cord is too short  it came with all the attachments but it would have been so nice if the cord was a little bit longer  especially if the outlet is almost to the floor  product is light and powerful   it is also very quiet   this is a huge improvement over my last hair dryer we needed a hair dryer for my baby after getting out of the tub  this little dryer does the trick  it gets a little hot when on the high speed  but as long as i hold it several inches away from his head  it s fine  can t beat the price and the size  it fits nicely in a top drawer when we have guests  found this hair dryer while on business while staying at one of the marriots   i could not believe how fast it dried my hair  with very low heat and lots of air  not to mention how shiny it was   so i decided to order my very own  my hair has never been easier to dry and style     and best of all my precious dog gets his fur blown out by this hair dryer as well and his fur is dry at super speed   what a great product and great price   last year i purchased one of these fancy dryers and all of a sudden it stopped blowing out hot air  what a waste    but perfect timing for this little baby   i am hooked on this one  this dryer is perfect for the intended purpose which is an efficient  small package at a very resonable price  the air flow and heat settings are good with well marked and designed switches  the folding handle and variable voltage make it ideal for travel as well  br    br   would definitely buy again  bought this dryer for taveling and for easy storage  i love this dryer and so glad i bought it  so nice  love the cool button  which holds the style in place after the brush is removed  my hair is styled much better due to settings      very nice product  but sometimes seems to actually get to hot  also the cord is long which is nice however it seems to get tangled easily  which is what it s supposed to do  br   loud  but what dryer isn t  br   overall seems to be pretty good  i keep it in a suitcase for traveling  i really like this hair dryer   maybe it s because ours was old and no longer did the ion thing  but this one prevents frizz and dries hair very quickly   and its not huge   it s a normal size in my opinion  smaller than many in the market   could not ask for more in a hair dryer  great dryer with good fan speeds   quieter than most without hurting your ears with high pitched noise   the cool down button lets you customize your heat  folds up for easy packing  we own 4 of these as they will probably quit making them for something of less quality soon  works well  was a direct replacement for old unit  so it was very easy to reinstall  handy to use from wall mount i didn t realize how close to death my old dryer had gotten until this one arrived  it dries my hair much more quickly and although it isn t quiet it s a much more tolerable noise than the whine my old one had developed  it is a bit heavy  but i like that   makes it feel sturdy and well made  the finish is nice too   kind of velvety  i definitely recommend this dryer  wife uses it daily    says it is much quieter and lighter than previous versions  and does a great job and it easy to use   would recommend buying this item    don t hesitate  it works perfectly  very fast                                    dries my hair really fast   love the product and would highly recommend   my daughter loved it also   product received on time  i had a conair yellowbird pro which is an awesome dryer  i had it for so many years the styling pick had developed a crack  thought i would upgrade  and this blackbird seemed like a good choice  br    br   it s not a bad dryer  i m thankful it is 2000 watts  but  it doesn t seem to move the air as strong as my yellowbird does  it seems a little underpowered  i m still going to search for perhaps a 2200 watt dryer  if i can find one  i want a dryer that has more power  not necessarily more heat  br    br   heat settings are good  the highest heat is quite hot  i use the second highest setting  it s nice to also have a no heat setting  but the no heat only works on low power  with is useless  next time  i ll make sure that i get the conair that has the cool shot button that cuts the heat while keeping the speed high  br    br   not a bad dryer  does the job  and certainly better that the 1875 watt piece of junk you get at the drugstore  consider a different model if airspeed is important to you  this is my second of the same model   previous one was used every day for over 5 years   exceptional value for money  dries hair really fast as it has good volume of air and the air temperature is just right  only problem is that it works for 110 v ac  us domestic voltage  only  it  s a nice dryer   it works well   i don t really use any of the special features  although it has the 3 heat settings and 1 cooling setting   i just dry my hair  it works as i desired  without blowing my hair with a blast   it is a gentle air for fine hair  my wife loves it and the night light is very nice   she uses it every day and finds it really works good it works fast  quietly and better than much higher priced hair dryers  i love the shine it leaves with minimal effort and time  i really love this hair dryer  my hair always looks nice and smooth and silky after using it and it dries my thick hair really fast  my hair has come out fantastic every time with this  the attachments are great  the only thing is that the attachments are hard to get on   but it works  love it and highly recommend  i had the same hair dryer for about six years  then it gave up   i really didn t want to have to find another kind and change the mounting bracket  etc   so i ordered the same model number and the bracket was still the same   yeah   i was able to change it out myself  everytime i take it of by bag at the gym  girls start laughing  but when they see me using it and the results  they ask me where i got it   i very proud of my purchase   d i bought this product in order to use it when i moved  i tried it and it seems pretty good  such a great tool  it makes hair drying much faster  and my hair never stays curly  it drys almost all straight  if you are looking for a lightweight dryer that doesn t create hurricane force winds this is the one  my hair is short medium length and fine  i don t need a mega dryer that sound like an aircraft  this is a compact little thing that fits the bill  it is also a tad quieter than the typical 1875 watt dryer  two settings high hot  and low  warm work great for creating a curl wave with a round brush  would recommend for short to medium length fine hair  i have very frizzy hair  but after i wash my hair and use this to dry it up it makes my hair soft and smooth  br   i would recommend this dryer to my friends  i was looking for an affordable hair dryer and picked this one based on other reviews  and its worked great for me  br   you can change the settings enough to get any kind of speed or temperature  and since you can fold the handle it s easy to store in a small bathroom drawer  br   the retractable cord is a plus too  and it doesn t get all tangled up with your other junk  no complaints  really nice  hair dryer  is for a gift and i m sure she will love it  i like the way the handle folds  ship very fast stuff is good  i like it  good styff  i love it  very nice good   good good good   very good   i purchased this hair dryer after watching a series of blow drying tutorials  i researched a lot about hair dryers since this was my first purchase  i wanted to invest in a decent blow dryer which would last me for atleast an year  i have wavy hair and i have recently got a layer cut done with a scoop  i understood the need of a good blow dryer to get that wow look that you get after a salon visit  i must say the elchim professional 2001 truly met all my expectations  the dryer is quite light and easily manageable by blow dry virgins  if you are planning to buy a blow dryer for the first time  then i would suggest you to go for this one  this 2000 watt dryer is very powerful and straightens your hair instantly  all you need a ceramic jumbo round brush   from brush lab  and this powerful device to create the look you have always craved for  i am really happy with the results my husband always admires my hair now and i simply can t stop blushing      i  wanted a red and black combi dryer  but they sent me a black one instead  thats ok  when this breaks  i m gonna simply make another purchase of the same product  i bought my first t3 for the weight  noise  and ionic benefits   i had a t3 for years and loved the performance   however the construction was shabby from day one  the nozzle would not stay in place  i ended up taping it on   when it finally died  i replaced it with another t3 thinking the first one was a lemon  this last one also disappointed   the first time i tried to replace the concentrator  it bent the dryer  br    br   plus this one seemed to leave my hair fuzzy   no benefits from ionic ceramic claims   this one is in a drawer and i use the revlon i bought for 1 3 the price  very good dryer for the price  i like the high speed without having to use high heat  retractable cord is great  had a good experience with this order  it took about 7 business days to arrive   and have been using this product for years  great hair dryer   wife loves the retractable cord and compact size  after using the hair dryer for about a year  the cord broke inside causing the dryer to shut on and off   the warranty is about useless because after paying all the shipping costs both ways  it costs as much as buying a new one  had this item for a year now and it just broke on me  so i figured i needed to write a review to warn buyers  when the item first arrived  the back lid  air vent  didn t close all the way but it really didn t bother me much  i ve had many other 1875w dryers and this one was a bit louder than my previous ones  about a week ago  the hair dryer stopped producing warm hot air and now it just blows cold air  had to throw it out and purchase a different hair dryer  this might just be a one time scenario    but i wouldn t purchase again  for the price  this is a pretty nice dryer  i almost never use the low setting on hair dryers regardless  but i tested it just to see  and it s not quite hot enough to give me the oomph i need to dry my hair  so there s that  the cold shot seems to suck up a lot of power  and i don t use it any more for fear of blowing a circuit breaker  but considering how much i paid for it  this does its job and it does it pretty well  my wife has an abundant  curly head of hair  and when her dryer took its last breath  i looked for a replacement with both ionic and heat sink  ceramic  qualities to efficiently dry her hair without damaging it   because of size and weight  it s not well suited for travel  and the retractable cord does not fully retract  but from reviews i ve read  this type of mechanism is problematic more often than not   you just live with the fickle function when you choose a model with both a retractable cord and a folding handle   that said  pumpkin seems content with her new dryer  not a bad little hair dryer  seems to work well  if i had any criticism it would be when using the low heat setting  it s a bit windier than i would ideally want  and the handle is a little fatter than it needs to be  but all in all  a nice dryer  i expected more from this hair dryer after reading the reviews   it wasn t as powerful as i like and the opening for the air coming out seems to be larger than my last dryer  so it just goes all over the place instead of being more focused   the thing i m most unhappy with is the cord   i always buy dryers that have the retractable cord because i can t stand having to deal with the cord getting wrapped around everything in my drawer   every other dryer that i ve had the cord goes all the way into the dryer just leaving the plug hanging out   this dryer has about a foot or more of cord still hanging   it is just a pain deal with the dangling cord while putting it in and out of the drawer every day   i m still deciding if i should return it or not  i like this drying in many ways  it is lightweight  it is powerful  has a great retractable cord and that is a huge plus  i hope it lasts a long time  easy to use  very handy  always at your disposal   it isn t a powerful dryer  but it works great on mens hair   the wall mount is simple to install  and it s shock protected   great value bright nightlight  light weight  excellent heat and air for such a compact hair dryer   a must have  space saver and reasonable price  my wife loves this hair dryer  it produces very warm air with tremendous air flow  i will say it took 2 months for it to finally come from the time i originally ordered it  i don t need any special hair tools that cost  100  i have thick  wavy hair and this works just fine  especially with the diffuser attachment  i love how the cord retracts and the handle folds up   it makes storing it wonderfully easy  i would recommend this to anyone  overall   i would have given it 5 stars  but had to withhold one  due to my wife s complaint that there is no separate heat and fan control switches   it also does not have cool blast or whatever they call it button that allows to temporarily switch off the heat while keeping the fan running   to be honest   her hair looks the same to me regardless what dryer she uses   its an excellent product  and if you are not super picky about your dryers   i highly recommend it  purchased this product from amazon more than a year ago and have had no issues with it all  great purchase  the infiniti by conair mighty mini tourmaline ceramic styler has traveled to many countries with me thanks to the ability to change voltage and is my favorite travel hair dryer   i m amazed at how powerful the hair dryer is for such a small product   it s very light weight  small  and the carrying case easily slips into a carry on or packed luggage   the attachments  though i never use them  are a nice addition as well   i do have to say that in some hotels and countries  i cannot use the high setting  i have to use the low setting otherwise the hairdryer will over heat   i haven t had this problem in the us as much as i have in europe   it s really not that big of a deal because the low setting is still extremely powerful and drys my hair in a matter of minutes   i have had several other mini dryers  both by connair and by revlon  but this is by far my favorite   i ve had it for four years and i hope to be able to use it for many more years to come  i always recommend it to my students on study abroad programs and to friends who do a lot of traveling  i love this little blow dryer   i use it to warm up my bed when it is cold at night    before i go to sleep   i dont use it to blow dry my hair so i dont know about how it would work for that  but it works great for my purposes  excelent product and quick delivery   if you want a professional hair dryer  this is used by stylists here  thank  you from dominican republic  excelente producto y entrega r aacute pida  si desea un secador de pelo profesional  este es el que utilizan las estilistas aqu iacute   gracias desde rep uacute blica dominicana  it is easy to use  my sister had the same brand hair dryer well the same just different color  i would never learn how to blow out my hair in a million years  it ll be three times as puffy and frizzy after i m done with it  after using this product with the comb i instantly fell for it  thanks to my sis and ofourse andis hair dryer i love and an finally manage my hair  most importantly i save a lot of time getting ready in the morning  i guess its great quality for its price  i would recommend it  actually i did and my cousin bought the same one after using mines  i had this model blow dryer for over 7 years until i dropped it and broke the fan  this blow dryer took many years of abuse and worked like a champ  i bought the same model to replace the one i had  none available  the best i have ever used   i used it ata friend s house while away for the weekend and knew i had to buy one   my daughters love it too  my old conair hair dryer finally smoked  it owed me nothing after many years of great service  and i couldn t find anything in the stores that measured up  found this one online and so far  it s great  i love that it has options  4 heat settings and 3 speeds with a cold shot feature and independent controls for many drying combinations  it was the only one i found like it  while the speed isn t as fast and the heat isn t quite as hot as the old one  it still does the job well and my hair will probably be happier for it  after returning one that felt awkward and top heavy  i like that this one feels light and balanced  i don t have need for the 2 attachments but they seem good quality  hoping it lasts as long as it s predecessor  very good product  lightweight and compact  but powerful  came quickly and was well packaged easy to use and place out of sight  this blowdryer is amazing  my sylist uses it in my hair and i had to buy it for my home  it works for me and my daughter with ease  a must buy  after 18 years  i found myself looking for a new hair dryer   i had been interested in the  ions  i d seen on many packages   this is a very nice hair dryer  it came with both a diffuser and a concentrator which snap on nicely and work well  as designed   it dries my hair very quickly even on the low setting  and i like how the intake is on the back rather than the sides and is less likely to draw longer hair into it   supposedly  you can remove that part for cleaning  but i haven t figured out how  br    br   overall  a really awesome product  especially for the price  i m a hairdresser  i bought this dryer thinking it would last and it broke after only 7 months    it was great while it lasted  now i have to buy a whole new dryer since fhi won t fix it because i purchased it through amazon  i love this blow dryer  its ionic which is the best type of blow dryer for your hair and it really does make hair smoother and softer  it very stylish looking and easy to hold  it works great every time i use it and only takes about 40 minutes to dry my hair  the heat flow is very strong and i also like the cool shot as well  it very chilly  lol nice  easy  portable hand dryer that is available in fun colors   i use this product with an attachable hood dryer to deep condition my hair   very convenient and the retractable cord makes it easy to store without the hassle of dealing with a messy cord  this hair dryer is perfect   love it    small but  powerful  i have very thick hair   it dryes it fast  exactly what i was looking for  i ordered this dryer for my sister and she loved it  it was exactly as the page and picture described drys your hair very quickly with a smooth shine   so glad i bought it   will fit into a small corner of my luggage  so very handy  i love this hair dryer   it dries my hair in half the time and leaves it feeling very soft and smooth   i can t believe the great price   i had been looking at it in a local store for  250    glad i didn t spring for that   it is also much quieter than other hair dryers   don t hesitate to buy this   you won t regret it  my wife had this itme before for more than 10 years and she sed that she love the way it works for all this time that she used this item  she ask me to buy this one because the other one it burns the extension cord actually the plug of the extension and this one have a reset and a power control on the plug so it might be better than the other one and it doesnt get to hot like the old ones i love everything about this hair dryer  so i am glad i ordered it   it is lightweight and does a great job  no complaints  i have very thick hair and this hairdryer dries it very quickly  the settings are great  the cord is wonderful  the price is awesome  conair makes great hair dryers  and this in no exception  relatively quiet  and generates sufficient heat to satisfy most customers  this hair dryer make and model is a replacement  of a product that i have been using for several years   this dryer is great to hang on the wall  saving space on the countertops  i like it    it is very easy to use and to handle it is also very practical if you want to take it for travel     my hair gets dry very quick i was surprise with the power of this dryer i thought it might be too low  but not   yes buy it  is a good product and cheap    one year warranty    fantastic dryer night light is great for kids and two speed is awsome   will buy another one of these next time   great price  lightweight  long cord which makes drying my hair and shifting the dryer from hand to hand so much easier  not as noisy as my last hair dryer  and it does dry my thick medium length hair faster than my past hair dryers  i am able to switch from warm to hot and high  off  low without having to look at the dryer   i really do love this hair dryer   i had the exact dryer prior to purchasing this one   i had it for many years before it gave out   i have thick  curly hair and this gets it dry in no time   its light weight and easy to hold   it has 3 different heat settings and high low setting for air flow   very happy with this product  my wife was looking for a small hair dryer that would not to hot  this product was just perfect  it is small but powerful enough to dry hair quickly  it may not be good for someone with alot of hair  it has two speeds  high and low but only one heat temperature  it would be more helpful it had a warm and a hot temperature  but for the price it was well worth it  i purchased this dryer because i wanted a compact  easily portable dryer for travel   the idea of a retractable cord was appealing   it is not compact   in fact  it s quite large    i returned it because the high heat level was not hot enough   it isn t ergonomic   it s heavy   i ended up buying the babylisspro tt tourmaline titanium travel dryer    i am thrilled with it   i have shoulder length fine hair  this is an awesome hair dryer   i never really thought there was much difference between the various kinds until now  my hair  which is thick  drys super quick and this dryer eliminates all the frizz   amazing    saved me a trip to the store  price was comparable to store items of similar design claims  i think conair has quality products  and the retractable cord is convenient and works dependably  has plenty of drying power  not an ideal travel dryer  as it is appropriately larger than small  under powered travel dryers  perfect for daily home use  last conair dryer lasted 5  years  similar design and features  i think that s good durability  gives great volume with exceptional heat control   would recommend to anyone looking to enhance body and volume with their hair  love this hair dryer   purchased this model after seeing the good housekeeping reviews   lightweight  the right amount of power to style my hair just right  nice extra features like the cool shot button and the extra long  flexible cord  and all at a reasonable price   would definitely recommend this product  this hair dryer is decent   it is quieter than my previous hair dryer  but i wish it was a little quieter  especially since being quiet is supposed to be one of it s key features   i love whatever material it is made of   whatever it is made from isn t a slick plastic  so it doesn t slip around in your hands or on the counter  which is nice   i would say it is right in the middle as far as weight goes  so if you need a light hair dryer  this is not for you  but it s not so heavy that i feel like i am getting a workout   i also do not feel that it dried my hair any faster than my previous hair dryers  so  it s not a bad hair dryer  but it s also not all that special   i would recommend it to others if it is on an awesome sale  otherwise  try something else  a hotel i stayed at had this model  loved it so much came home from my trip and ordered it  dries my hair quickly and small enough that it doesn t take up too much counter space in my bathroom  i bought this dryer to replace one i use at home   it is a good hair dryer but only has one heat setting   i love the way it folds up for storage and the cord retracts which is nice   these 2 features alone make it great for travel  it s just as advertised   dries my hair quickly  folds up nicely and neatly  the retractable cord is great  it s a good purchase  my wife loves this hair dryer  its easy to use  drys and curls her hair nicely  just make sure your hair is damp not real wet before putting it in rollers  other wise your hair really won t dry or curl  the hair dryer will work better and you will have a full head of curley hair  this is a very nice and functional hair dryer   one thing that s bothersome  the switch for the blue light   it turns off whenever i hold on to the dryer   that means i have to adjust my hold on the dryer   otherwise  it s pretty good  for years  i ve used conair 1875s for both our primary blow dryer  yes  my wife has long hair  and our travel needs  motorcycle touring means limited luggage space   the dryer produces a high volume of heated air for rapid drying  its wattage draw is low enough that tripping circuit breakers is never an issue  durability is good   our s usually last at least five years with daily use by two people  the current iteration of this model uses a shorter cord and a bulkier plug gfi than earlier models  while i prefer the original configuration  longer cord with smaller plug gfi   the changes have not seriously compromised the product  i am thrilled with this hair dryer   it is better than even i imagined   looked at several at the local beauty supply houses    all with huge price tags   i am so happy with this one  i can t begin to explain   my hair is not fly away like it is with my old dryer   it has plenty of volume and is sleek and shiny   i can t believe it took me so long to buy such a quality dryer   i recommend this highly  i love this hair dryer   i bought the travel size and a local ulta   i immediately loved it   drys my hair fast and doesn t fry it  would recommend it  this is a hairdryer   it does not get too hot on the hot setting bit it dries my hair in five minutes   my old dryer used to take 20 minutes  it is very potent and haven t given me any problem so far  br   i paid  3 and something plus shipping  so it was very cheap and i think it s a good quality product  br   ok  it might not be the best hairdryer out there  it is not made of ceramic and has no ion thingy to keep your hair from splitting and things like that   but it was just what i needed  i would buy it again  for that price   this dryer is absolutely awesome  the heat settings are exactly what i needed  and the force and speeds are great for volume and fast drying  really worth the price  this one doesn t seem as powerful as the previous one i owned but it is just as well   my previous one would sometimes burn my scalp it was so hot  great product  i just love my new hair dryer and gets my hair nice and straight without getting to hot  it comes with two attachments and is priced right for me  really works well   one if the best hair dryers i have owned   definitely a great deal since they are  300 00 retail one of the best reasonably priced dryers out there  my old one made my hair frizzy and dried out  i am so pleased with my results  i have ordered several of these dryers and have been happy with them all   i run a salon and enjoy retailing these dryers to my clients after my old hair dryer died  i decided to get this one because my mom has it  i had it for only two or three months before it started to make rattling noises when i used it  i would hit it  and the rattling would lessen  however  after a short while of this happening  i was drying my hair and it started to smell smoky  i decided to give up on it before it caught fire or something  br   if my mom didn t have the same one that has been working perfectly fine for over a year  i would have rated this one star  i had a previous similar model for many years and needed repl  this one is great  best price on net  good hair dryer for use with the big curlers  a longer hose would have been good  it holds you hostage while you dry  i ordered this because it was cheaper than sallies sold it for  i actually have this product and it has been the best hair dryer i ve ever owned  so i ordered a new one for my mom as a gift  it came in the exact packaging and i couldn t be happier  now my mom can stop stealing my hair dryer  i got this for a trip that i was taking and didn t want to take my bulky dryer   this one is lightweight  has good power selectiion and temperature control settings   i m very happy with conair products after 8 years with my old hair dryer  it was time for a new one  br   this dryer had more option than my old one  br   and it cut my drying time in half  good speed and heat options  i like that the hair dryer is pretty small  my other one was huge and awkward to maneuver  the concentrator attachment is good  every hair dryer needs one  the diffuser is scary haha  i have no idea what to do with it but whatever  it is apparently for creating volume  but i have thick  short asian hair so i don t need any extra volume  cord length is fine  the back opens up really easily for cleaning  the cool button and cool heat function are actually cool  most hairdryers take time to cool down  so going from hot to cold doesn t work  however  on this hairdryer  if you want to go straight from hot to cool  it happens in seconds  maybe it s just because it has cooled down here in san diego but i can t really definitively determine that  anyways great hairdryer     this product is very good  i also use it for straighten my hair because it came with attachments  br   my hair was dry with in 5minutes  the price was also good and it came with a one year warranty  great lightweight dryer  dries hair fast and is so quiet you can actually hear your client talking to you  even in a busy salon  a replacement for another conair  this one is the best  there are cheaper models  but this one is very well made and we have every reason to expect the longevity other reviewers have noted  i use the low setting  i used to use high on my old one  and it works beautifully and is much quieter  the cord retractor is great  at first i expected this to be just a marketing gimmick  but now i wouldn t buy a dryer without one  very nice to pull the cord in and drop the dryer in a drawer without having to roll up the cord first  and then untangle it whenever you take it out  we ended up buying two of these to prevent my daughter from swiping it and having to search  nice to find a product that is well made and reasonably priced  this is not a cheap throw away  it is a good value  the off on switch on my old conair travel dryer broke after 5 6 years  so i purchased this one after reading reviews  it s even more compact than the old one  and i was pleased to find that it came with a 6  cord  unlike the old dryer that had a curly cord that wouldn t stretch far  it dries my hair in about 3 minutes  and the long cord and two heat settings make it ideal for drying my dogs after bathing  too  the only thing missing is a case for the hair dryer  the old conair came with one and i saved it   the new one fits perfectly  not heavy  buttons not in the way   didn t like the diffuser  so just attached a hot sock diffuser  works just fine  like the sleek look to it  this is the best  35 investment that i could have possibly made for my hair   i have thick  coarse  curly ish with a semblance of a wave hair so blow drying it can be quite a challenge   this hair dryer gets my hair very straight in no time  i purchased this mainly for the retractable cord because my storage space is limited  the cord does not retract well and when it does still leaves about a foot hanging out  even has a stopper  if it reaches it  that leaves about 8 inches out  i didn t even try to plug it in  love amazons return policy      i ve had this hair dryer for about a month  it is very powerfull  i have a lot of hair and this hair dryer dries my hair very very fast i bought this based on other reviews indicating that it would dry my hair faster  they say 40  faster and i suppose that s accurate   40  faster is really not as big of a difference as you would expect  it s also incredibly heavy considering there s not much difference between this and your usual hairdryer  if you want a good workout every morning though  then definitely get it  i came on amazon trusting the reviews that people would give this product  i bought it because it had high reviews and a great price  with a solid 4 star review  i expected a lot more from this dryer  br    br   the issue about this dryer that bothers me the most is the air flow  when you turn it on  it sounds like those cheap kid toys with a wind motor  then it warms up a bit and you get used to the cheap motor and you dry your hair  it doesn t have enough air force  i mean  it s a standard blow dryer so yes it has good air flow  but i expected something a lot more impressive from the reviews given  br    br   on a plus side  it does have good heat  br    br   i also thought that the air flow would be solved with that front clamp thingy  the front thingy that pushes the air flow in a very specific direction  but no  actually the air feels more dispersed with the front clamp thing  wha   br    br   i guess this comes down to the fact that you get what you pay for  but sometimes i have paid very little and have gotten a whole lot  this was not the case  br    br   mostly  i really wish the reviews would have matched the quality of this product  br    br   disappointed and i would not suggest people to purchase this dryer unless you re really looking for a meh whatever kind of dryer with a good cheap price  i purchased this hair dryer because i used one in a hotel i was staying at and liked it   i also took into consideration that i have limited space in which to hang it and it was perfect  product is light as advertised but does not seem as strong as it should be   the first i received came apart as it was missing 2 screws  but amazon was great and stood behind product and sent another out immediately   that one is fine   love the t3 feather weight  this was exactly as advertised  i especially liked the dimensions given  thanks to the reviewer who told me how to switch the lever behind the lint filter to get full power  perfect size for travel  it works better than any hotel wall mounted blower i ve tried   it is quite powerful for its size   not like a regular size blower of course  over all i am very pleased i m a hairstylist and this was recommended by a couple of coworkers  it recently arrived  but i ve used it on a number of clients already and it s great  strong airflow  high heat  lightweight  cool shot button  and works very well with my diffuser attachment also   makes my job much easier  it s powerful and with high efficiency  just hope that it can continue working well for me for a longer time  at least more than 6 months     d br   by the way  delivery is also fast  i chose this particular dryer because of the great ratings it received   i am not disappointed   i like that its lightweight and compact and that does not overheat   i m very pleased with this product and would recommend it  works well for an item that cost less than 30 00  very light and compact  i do apt of road travel so this dryer works well  usually i buy conair hair dryers but chose the andis and it is more powerfull than the conair even though they are 1875 watt   i have not used the attachments because i have short  straight  thick hair that i blow dry and it just falls into place requiring little brushing   i do believe it is just a bit heavier than the conair dryer but not so much that causes me a problem   i am so glad i chose the andis instead of another conair   it was packaged very well and arrived two days after i placed my order   i would be glad to recommend this andis 82005 to my family and friends  this blow dryer is great   it blow dries my hair in about half the time of my old blow dryer   it also helps tame my frizzy hair   love it  i bought this for travel purposes and it has exceeded my expectations  when folded up  this hair dryer fits in the smallest places and isn t bulky at all  this portable hair dryer is pretty strong and dries my hair just as quickly as any other large dryer i have ever tried  the only criticism i have for this product would be how loud it is  love this hairdryer       its one of the best around        drying time is so much less and it doesn t fry your hair as many others have  br   i would buy it again  i have to say this hair dryer is a really good product  it arrived when expected  i was very pleased that it contained a template so i would know exactly where to drill the pilot holes for the screws  i admit i had not seen that type of drywall anchor before and had to be extra careful not to knock them to far into the wall  but they worked just fine  my husband and i have been using the dryer for a couple weeks now  just as other people mentioned  the nightlight is over the top  but i just use the gfi buttons on the plug to shut it it off  i love not having a hair dryer sitting on the counter  the only reason i removed one star is i wish the dryer had lower speed  it does have two speeds  but both are quite powerful  i would not hesitate to order again and probably will for the guest bathroom  this is a great hairdryer   i am thrilled with this purchase   i would recommend this hairdryer to anyone   it dries my hair very quickly  great product and at a great price     just the type of product i seek out  the andis dryer is light and comfortable to hold   and easy to use  shipped quickly and works wonderfully  nice hot dryer to get the job done in no time  you will not be sorry  this little beauty has great heat and blowing capacity   i love it and use it at home and when traveling   i like the small size and light weight   it s amazing that they packed 1600 watts into this tiny little blower   you ll love the power it has  i have since bought two for others as gifts  i had another t3 that died after years of use  i received my new drier expeditiously and don t want to be without it  great service and great product  great  quiet  quick  pretty  lots of setting options  dries much quicker than my other dryer   less frizz too  definitely my favorite dryer i ve had  more professional  also shipped quickly  i d recommend  if you are looking for a great dryer for both home and travel   this is it  i am more than satisfied with this product  in fact  i will be ordering another one because i do not want to be without it  the shipping was faster than expected and it was packaged well  i enjoy the compact size and the wall mount comes in handy when you don t have a lot of counter space for hair dryers  in spite of some of the negative reviews this dryer does exactly what i need it to do  i m an african american natural   i purchased this hair dryer to get a better result out of my deep conditioning treatments  i only gave this a 3 because it s not mobile   it s so huge to store   other wise it heats just fine  also because i would imagine if my goal were to completely dry my hair it d take a great deal of time but i don t use heat to dry my hair so for me this is great with my plastic cap just to activate my conditioning and hot oil treatments  but it adjusts just fine   i m comfortable under it  you do need to be a bit creative about where to put it i suppose  i sit on the toilet w it perched on my portable drawers i use for storage  i guess you may need to be creative to use it on a table top or maybe a ocunter of some sort but other than that i m pleased for my intended purposes  i can not say enough good things about this hair dryer  i have long curly hair that took over an hour to dry  now i can actually leave for work on time  my previous dryer was more expensive and not even close to being as good or as fast  no reason to ever spend more money again  i am a very satified customer  without a doubt  i will be a repeat customer next time i need a new hair dryer  overall the power and cord length in this blow dryer works very well   my only complaint is the temperature of the warm setting   with very fine hair it is important for me to use as little heat as possible on my hair to avoid damage   the warm setting is hotter than my old one  and i ve never even used the hot setting  nice size for storage  dryer came ready to use  and the cool switch is great as last stage to dry  it would be nice to have a hanger loop  at first i wasn t sure about how it would work  after buying the right adaptor  however it did and i an very impress  i have decided to buy this same product for a friend s birthday  i hope she too would find it as useful as i did  fast and helpful used them before would use them again i choose them over my pro distributer that all folks love this blow dryer   cool with retractable cord and small that fits when you travel  perfect size  weight and great air quality  drys hair quickly  like others that have reviewed  i had used this hair dryer at the cosmpolitan hotel in vegas  br   took a photo with my phone so i could order one when i got home  br   i have lots of hair and it does a great job and has the benefit br   of folding and retractable cord  i love the infinity conair hairdryer   i especially like that it has the ceramic heater since it doesn t get hot enough to burn my 2 year old great granddaugher when she is in the the bathroom with me   the cord reel works great  i initially ordered the solano 3500  though it look sturdy and well made  my conair 207p infinity tourmaline ceramic hair dryer dries my hair way faster than the solano 3500  i was going to exchange it with the solano 3700 but it wasn t on sale and i don t want to pay  200 dollars for a hair dryer  i was hesitant to try the sedu 4000i because of some negative reviews but i thought worst case scenario i can return it if i end up not liking it  sedu 4000i is really small compared to other pro hair dryer  it look sturdy   has a sleek look and weighs 1 2 lbs  weighed not including the cord  hair dryer s length is 5 3 4 inches   without the concentrator     depth 2 3 4 inches  height   from top of the dryer to the bottom of the handle   7 3 4 inches  solano 3500 though much bigger than sedu 4000i just weigh 1 pound  first time i used the sedu 4000i i was so impressed  it dried my hair way faster   took only 10 minutes   than my 4 yr old conair that burns my hair sometimes  i have long   mid back   hair  medium thickness with some wave and i don t like to use flat iron or any kind of hair products on my hair    except shampoo and conditioner    sedu is also quieter than my old conair and solano 3500  with sedu 4000i my hair looks so shiny  straight and frizz free  i keep the ion switch off on my hair dryer because i want some body volume on my hair  i so love my hair dryer that i am always looking forward to use it  very highly recommended  i purchased this hair dryer for my wife who happens to be a professional hair stylist  and i would say that she is very selective  picky  about the products she uses  for her work  similar hair dryers sell for almost  200  consequently  i thought this was a very good buy  at any rate  so far she loves this product  she uses it at home and has nothing but compliments about the dryer  she even suggested that we should buy one for each of our two daughters for christmas  so far  a very happy customer  i chose this because i like this product and because it was a great price  i would recommend this to anyone interested in this product  blow dryer is awesome and works very well i love this in my kids bathroom because its something they actually put up  it s working great  our last one only lasted about a year  so hopefully this one will last longer brilliant product  excellent delivery service  love the finish of the haridrier  i didn t realised that it was american plug so i ve purchased an adaptor from amazon and all sorted     this looked like a good hairdryer when i unpacked it  but the hose will not stay attached to the bonnet and if you hold it by hand  the hot air never gets to the front and top of the bonnet   it s basically useless  it is in good quality and convenient to use  i am highly recommended this product  and i love the product  i replaced this unit after 15 years with the same model   works great  just need to clean fan area occassionally  i had ordered this product before and accidently ordered a smaller version of the one i wanted   it mounted easily and works fine even tho i would prefer a stronger drying force  i recently was medically retired from the military  as part of my transition to the civilian world  i have decided to grow out my hair because  in my mind  i believe i will one day look as stylish and sexy as leonardo decaprio  i am finding  though  that to achieve that look there is a lot involved including blow drying your hair  not just for style but functionality as walking around all morning with wet hair is not fun  br    br   this ceramic hair dryer is amazing  it folds up saving space which is great since i am an organized o c d  son of a gun after so many years in the military  to add to the storage technique the cord conveniently retracts back into the main body of the blow dryer  br    br   this means that i can use the hair dryer both at the home and on the road as i do travel quite  a bit and find the hair dryers that come free in many hotel rooms leaving a lot to be desired  br    br   for its size  this hair dryer is also very powerful  i was surprised at both the amount of air it is able to blow as well as how hot it is capable of getting  it comes with a cool blast button which circulates regular room air  i use this setting when blowing hair off my neck after shaving it or after cutting my children s hair  br    br   probably one of the biggest selling points  since i am a man  is the stylish grey silver black colors that feel manly in my hand versus the lime green and hot pink blow dryer my wife tried to get me to use the other morning  br    br   overall  a very attractive and functional hair dryer that also has durability on its side  a great investment  i have long hair  it goes just past my mid back  and i blow dry my hair almost every day  so as you can imagine a good hair dryer is very important to me  although i only got the hair dryer yesterday after using it this morning i had to post a review  this is the best hair dryer i have had in a long time  it has a lot of power and my hair was completely dry in about 10 mins      considering how much hair i have this is fast  the dryer itself is not too heavy and is quieter than most models  my hair was so soft  straight and shiny after using this hair dryer i must say i am instantly in love  we had one of these for years  replaced it with a different design  but returned to this one because it s just a superior design  br    br   easy to unlatch and latch securely to the wall mount  excellent performance in drying hair  br    br   i should have ordered two just in case they stop making this design type    hard to find  i have owned this dryer for two and a half years and it still work perfectly  br    br   all dryers seem to be the same with a fan  a heating element a stay cool body and some controls  this one has a powerful heating element  1875 watts   and a good fan  for its size   the purpose of a hair dryer is not to heat up the hair to boil away the water  but to speed up the evaporation process of drying by exposing the hair to a stream of hot air  the faster the stream and the warmer the air  the more evaporation occurs   where this dryer differs is in the body that has a longer and narrower nozzle that is about one inch wide  this forces a much stronger blast of air  at least on high speed  that is not a wide as those dryers with a wide nozzle  br    br   if your hair is fine  colored  permed or naturally curly  you would want a different dryer with a wider nozzle to diffuse the heat so that the hair dries more slowly at a cooler temperature  that may make the hair less likely to frizz and it may give the hair more volume  br    br   this dryer makes the nozzle narrow and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot in order to make the hair it blows on dry rapidly  you can adjust the fan speed and the temperature  but not the concentration of the air flow  br    br   so  if you have regular hair or  like me  are a guy that just wants to dry their hair rapidly  this is the dryer for you  put it on high speed and high heat and it is extremely fast  i have fine  relatively straight  long hair  i bought this hair dryer a year ago  thinking that it would last for a while  i use it every other day to dry my hair  nothing unusual   it worked as described for almost a year and suddenly the plastic covering the shaft started to melt down  it still works but i m not sure if its still safe to use it  just consider another product if you are ready to spend this kind of money  i bought this blow dryer about a month ago  and it works really well  it heats up  had good air pressure  and the cool setting works well also  the only complaint i have is the retractable cord  the button is a bit touchy  it only works if you push on one part of it  it is also a bit difficult for me to squeeze hard enough with one hand  the cord itself is a decent length  but it is easy to pull it past the red tape that warns you not to pull any further  i can not tell you how amazing this blow dryer is   a great price too   a must have for every woman  as usual most of items here i buy for my wife    she likes this hair dryer  it has cold  warm and hot regime  concentrator and diffuser that helps her to stylish her hair in different ways  it s very comfortable to hand it  we are thinking about remington flat iron now    straight forward  strong hot heat  i m a guy and this thing is the simple hot strong wind i wanted  simple high and low setting  that s all  i bought this hairdryer bc i was looking for a compact dryer with a retractable cord and handle  this is exactly what i wanted  the grip is matte so it gives a nice grip  it folds to make the dryer smaller  the retractable cord works well and makes the dryer very convenient to use in my small bathroom or if i m traveling  the settings are also good   3 varieties that dry my hair quickly  the dryer is not very loud either  it s a reasonable noise level  my husband has been using a hair dryer with broken teeth off the comb for what seems like forever   when he mentioned it  i immediately went to amazon  found just the right hair dryer and it works perfectly   it has just the right heat and accessories for both of us   i would suggest to others to buy this  one  very light weight  and is not too hot on hair  gets the job done  very happy with this hair dryer  the andis 30925 hangup hair dryer is a great little product   mounts to the wall in it s own holder  so it is up out of the way   it is small but very powerful and dries even the longest hair evenly and quickly with a nice strong flow of air without scorching   the nightlight is a nice touch too  br    br   however  i would like to see the nightlight go back to a softer green color   the new blue nightlight is very bright and i had to put a piece of tape over it to mute it down  br    br   great product  buy it for your house  this hair dryer is without a doubt the best i have ever purchased  it is light  easy to handle  and leaves my hair soft and silky  will dry hair very quickly  eliminating flyaways and frizz  great tool for the price  i like this dryer   it s pretty loud as far as hair dryers go and i like that it has three different heat levels but i find that warm isn t warm enough but hot is pretty darn hot   so hot i can t use it when i dry my childrens  hair   i use it myself but worry that much heat could be damaging my hair   cool shot works well and it s a good weight for a dryer  br    br   update 2 years later   i have had this hair dryer for almost 2 years and i always noticed that the handle was warm   well  this morning  it sparked and caught fire   needless to say  i m less than happy   i ve had plenty of other hair dryers that have lasted for many years and even when they ended up breaking  they just stopped working as opposed to almost causing a fire in my house     this is a huge problem   i have changed my rating   do not purchase this dryer  i used this hairdryer while on a trip to ireland   while it s true that you only get one functioning speed when using the dryer with 240 volts  the speed you have is very powerful   i stayed at a number of hotels that had dryers available  but in most cases  i used this one instead   this gave me the convenience of using it anywhere in the room and had more power than those supplied by the hotels   it is very light weight and compact for packing   i would definitely recommend this to others who want to be certain they have a functioning hair dryer while in european countries without having to purchase and take the risk of using a convertor   a plug adapter is still necessary   a simple turn of a screw using your fingernail changes the dryer from 120 240 volts  best dryer i have ever owned   i love it   it took a bit to get it but it was well worth the wait  my sister had one and i did too   the dryer would turn off on everything but the low setting right out of the box  both units did this  do not buy  no  you re not going to be one of the lucky ones   don t buy this piece of junk  this little hairdryer is very light  easy to use  with 2 attachments  the controls are easy to use  and there s a button for cooler air so that you can actually set your hair using hot then cold air  i m very happy with the purchase  i have previously owed one of these and i really like the convenience of the wall mount  heat and air are great i had this blow dryer a few years ago it lasted 6 yrs  i have since gone through the chi which broke in 6 months   solano which has completely destroyed my hair    only because i couldn t remember the name of my old dryer  it was just recently while asking a friend if she knew of a good blower that i was reconnected with the twin turbo  it is by far the best blow dryer i have ever had   this is a good basic dryer   i don t use the attachments but find that it works quickly and is easy to hold   i don t think that it being tourmaline ceramic adds much to the product s quality  but it s still a fine product  my husband continues to tease me because i continue to gush about how much i love this blow dryer  he says ooooh   it plugs in and blows air   how special  says the man with little hair to blow    this is a great dryer   i have longish straight hair   and it dries it in a heartbeat without frying my hair   the variety of settings really work well   and the cool shot button is instantaneous  my hair hasn t looked this good in years  this is a great hair dryer   easy to use and store   i don t like cords loose on things and the cord stores in the handle of the dryer with just a press of a button   we had stayed at the fairmont hotel in washington dc and this was the dryer they have in their bathrooms   i liked it so much that i looked on amazon com and sure enough i found it and bought it  much cheaper than i thought it would be too    my hair is short and fine but this drys it in half of the time as my old one and gives it lots of volume  this hairdryer works and is easily portable  br   it been taken to many places since i bought it br   and my wife   who is fussy about stuff like this   br   adores it  great little dryer  blows strong and price is just right  biggest down side as others have mentioned is when you press the cool button power goes down quite a bit  so unfortunately there is no way to blow a lot of cool air  this hair dryer is great  i especially love the cord keeper feature  very good product  i would recommend this product to anyone  this is an awesome product  i have a mid length hair and it dries them in 5 mins on high warm setting  there are 2 settings  one for the temperature and the other for speed  so you can choose between cool warm hot on one side and low high on the other end   the product was delivered on the said delivery date and it is a great value for money  i had been looking for an affordable but fast drying dryer  this one is amazing  it gets my hair dry a lot quicker  does not overheat  and has great adjustable speeds and heating  however  i will say that the only con to this product is that it is not completely comfortable to hold  i will occasionally hit the cold button on the hair dyer because i don t know where else to comfortably hold it  love  the fact that this dryer is a little lighter in weight than the original one that i also have   it does not seem to have the same drying power as the original   i keep this one in my travel bag for that reason  it is easy on the hair and does not seem to frizz out the hair as some brands seem to do all the time   i recently stayed in a high end hotel  and this is the hairdryer that was in my room   after using it just once  i had to buy one for myself whatever the cost   when i got home and placed the order  i was surprised and pleased to see that this hair dryer is also a great value   there are not too many bells and whistles on this dryer  just a good  strong flow of air that isn t too loud   it also folds into a compact size and includes a retractable cord  so it is easy to store in a drawer  i am always traveling and needed something light weight and small  after reading other reviews on this product i decided to give it a try  i love it  it s very light and small  it also comes with a travel size bag  it doesn t tangle your hair  very good dryer for those who s always on the go or even if you re not and you want something light and small    i was a little hesitant to purchase since it was rather cheap for a good ionic dryer but it worked great  i have 3c type hair and it dried my hair rather quickly and straight  with minimal frizz but it did die out exactly a year later  so i guess you get what you pay for    but it was good while it lasted  i ordered thursday night i received friday night  comparing its price  i really suprised from its quality  it is pleasant to touch its surface and it works very well  i am really oversatisfied  touch wood   i hope i wont have a trouble in coming days  my chi hair dryer had just broken after having it for less than a year and i went to buy a new one at walmart  this one claims to work as well as chi but it works better  im obessed with it  it drys my hair faster and makes it so much smoother  it makes my hair shinier and looks smooth even after i straighten it  i highly reccomend buying it  fast shipping  nice weight  high quality product  great choices of speeds  heat and cooling levels  dries hair quickly and effortlessly  highly recommended  i have really rebel wavy hair and my mom got this as a gift 10 yrs ago  we both used it  she gave it to me abt 4 5 yrs and honestly it sooo good  it leaves ur hair sleek and shiny  depending how good you take care of your hair   anyway just recently it makes this weird sound and it smells kindda bad haha but i cant complain  i just need a new one after 10 yrs  this hair dryer is great because of a few key features  1  the retractable cord  ok ok not so special  2  it has 3 heat settings  3 levels of blowing and a cooling button for this price thats unheard of  its so sturdy and nice and a cool metallic color too  not loving the neon barbie pink but hey its a great dryer for cheap  and its got some nice attachments too like a huge serious diffuser   perfect for long thin hair that doesn t need to be dry in a salon  it won t burn your hair and will leave it with no friz i originally bought this for my guest bathroom but decided to put in the master and i am so glad i did  i don t have to get the dryer out everyday to dry my hair  it s right there and the night light feature is great also  my hair isn t thick so the blow power isn t an issue with me but it really blows and drys my hair in no time  i m thinking about getting another one for our guest bath and for a christmas gift  i bought this product because it was highly rated by good housekeeping as best lightweight dryer   it is lightweight and easy to handle   dries fast  even on low heat  the fan on off switch has the off position in the middle of the rocker    wish it were the down position  a bit confusing when you are not looking   also  this would be a fantastic product if the very  very long cord were a retract   the long cord is a real asset   no doubt about it and it doesn t tangle  i would certainly buy again  when this hairdryer came i was super excited  i bought to replace the one i had bought back in high school  longer ago than i care to remember    it works well  nothing special   it s nice that the cord can be stored inside the dryer istelf  but leaves the plug portion just hanging out awkwardly so it makes it kind of hard to store in a regular sized vanity drawer  it comes with two attachments which i use and find helpful when drying my hair for special occasions   it s okay  probably would have gone with one that was a little bit cheaper if i had to do it over again  price is ok and this product definitely meets my expectations  only  the ionic feature is not so well developed  i have a braun ionic hairdryer and i love the ionic feature  i almost anticipated that the ionic feature is not be so good with this product on account of the low price and i was right  so  the product is fully ok  only if you buy it just for the ionic feature  then you might be disappointed  this is the second andis hairdryer i ve had of this type  the first one lasted six years and i used it almost every day  then it eventually started to overheat and would turn itself off almost immediately after turning it on  it is outstanding and that s why i bought another one  i personally like the light on  it because it makes a great night light in the bathroom  however  there is one problem and that is the reason i m giving it four stars instead of five  the screws that are used to attach this hair dryer to the plate that goes on the wall have a phillips head that does not match american phillips screwdrivers  i was very lucky to have one special screwdriver that worked  why i didn t remember this problem from the first andis hair dryer i don t know  i think they should include american head phillips screws when sending it to an address in the united states  this hairdryer is the loudest one i have ever owned  br   i m actually thinking of buying another and using this only br   for travel  br    br   other than that  it s very lightweight  compact and dries br   well  br    br   because it s so loud  i would not recommend this to a friend  i bought this hair dryer because i liked that it came with the attachments and that it was reasonably priced  what i found was in addition to the attachments  this hair dryer is very powerful  i recently had to use my old dryer and kept looking at it to make sure i had it on high  then was looking to see if there was dust blocking the way  what a huge difference  br   i highly recommend this dryer  my only complaint would be the buttons on the handle are not in a great place  i had to get used to holding the dryer and not turning it off by accident  i still give it five stars though  i really didn t expect anything spectacular with this dryer but i am satisfied with the product overall   the seller did not tak elong at all to get my product out to me and it arrived packaged nicely and undamaged  i am using the dryer now as i write this review and even though it is very cheaply made i am impressed with the heat settings  high is indeed very high heat and perfect for when i do my deep conditioning treatments   the airflow is not bad either considering where the holes are place   all around the top of the hood  and then the airflow from the opening in the back  i can actually see this doing a good job on my hair if i were to roller set and get under the dryer no problem   if you are just looking for a cheap but gets the job done such as deep conditioning with heat for 15 20 minutes type of hair dryer then i say buy this one  its ok for its price  i purchased this hair dryer over two years ago  after using one at a hotel  and it s still going strong   it s a great dryer   light weight  perfect size  enough power to dry my hair  and very reasonably priced   i m ordering another one as a back up  in case they quit making this model   love it    over heated and shut off within the first five minutes of use  returned to amazon  would in no way recommend this dryer cuts my drying and styling time in half  it works very well and i am very happy to have bought it  i own three andis turbo 1600w hair dryers  why   it has tremendous power and dries hair quickly  the low setting is very adequate   the andis is slightly more quiet than most hair dryers   it s excellent for hair health because the heat temp  is modified    severe heat damages hair    my first andis is 10 years old  my thanks to the engineers   this is a very good product   i have owned countless hair dryers   at last  i ve found the best  this dryer is a waste of money  the hood does not adjust and it is difficult to get it positioned over your head so your hair actually dries  you have to stick your head all the way to the top of the hood to really get the air on your hair  and since it only really comes out of a few holes on the top it just burns a few spots and doest really affect the rest of your hair  this is only good for people with really straight fine hair  not for rollers or any types of styling       night light quit working after a week  the dryer itself works fine snd is handy being located on a wall and not in a drawer  i bought this dryer last year and loved it  i bought the new generation this year and it simply shuts off and overheats way too soon  i bought this same dryer 8 years ago and absolutely loved it   when friends would use it  they d always wanted to know where i got it but it had been so long that i forgot   when it blew out  because i dropped the power cord hard on the floor for many o years  i knew i had to replace it   i searched for it on amazon and sure enough  they had it and you can t beat the price   it s quiet and does a great job on long hair  this hair dryer is amazing   my hair is very wavy     time very curly  br   this dryer let s me style my hair easily   it makes my dryer time so much faster  br    br   love it   br    br   maggie  river vale  nj this is the second time i purchased the same exact item  my first one lasted at least 4 years  it works  would give it a 0 if i could br   bonnet had a hole in it  and the air just doesnt seem to get through  this is a cheap product  make the investment  i ve had my share of hair dryers in my life time  so i confess i was relieved when my old one died  i knew exactly what i wanted  1  ionic technology because it helps reduce my frizzies  br   2  at least 3 heat settings  tired of warm and too hot  br   3  power  my hair is thick and it takes some air velocity to dry it  most dryers are pretty good  but the turbo setting does increase it  it s not wind tunnel awesome  but it s helpful  br   this hair dryer met those requirements  as noted by several other reviewers  it is a bit larger and heavier than most other hand held hair dryers  if that is not an issue for you  i think you will like it  i just returned from a trip to israel and this travel dryer performed beautifully   all i needed was the plug adapter that i had purchased and when i set the dryer to the international voltage the dryer functioned perfectly   i had no issue with over heating and had really effective power which was far superior to the dryer in our bathroom provided by the hotel   i also appreciated the folding feature making it easy to pack   highly recommend     does all that i had hoped      helps to declutter my vanity top and dries my hair  as for the night light    i find that a plus    soft glow in the whole vanity area  conair 1875 hair dryer br    br   stopped working in less than a month   the reset button won t click  so it won t start   don t feel like the hassle of trying for a credit or return  don t have packaging   am going to buy local where i can easily return something  i purchased two of the hairdryers on aug 12th  and today is sept  13th so they are only one month old   i have been careful to sort of break in the first one by using low power for a minute before going to high power and then to switch to low power when i am finished before turning off   i was concerned since several reviews stated that they had problems with the unit failing after using it only for a short time   so far i am very pleased with my purchase and am considering buying two more to keep as reserves   it is almost impossible to buy 1600 w dryers now and even harder to find dryers than have the side mounted motors and fans which i like   the new 1875 w dryers can cause circuit breakers to trip and i don t feel we need that much heat on our hair  we must all remember that in this economy everyone is trying to cut costs  and that pertains to hairdryers as well as everything else   anything we can do to reduce the shock to a new appliance can possibly lengthen the life of the product   nothing lasts as long as they used to as we have found with clothes washers and dryers  refrigerators  dish washers  ac units etc   however  so far  i am extremely pleased with this hairdryer   hopefully that will stay the same for months ahead  great product  easy and fast results  love it   fast shipping   i have curly hair and this product straightens my hair in about twenty twenty five minutes   and i am no professional  our old dryer died and we decided to try this one for the ionic system  the dryer is very fast  has mutiple settings and my wife who didn t like hair dryers  because she has very fine hair  really likes this one and uses it  it does a very good job and this model seems perfect to me  this dryer is very cheaply made   i used it once  did not work second time  i went to rite aid and bought a small conair travel dryer  which i ve had before   great dryer  i was able to test drive this hair dryer at la bellaserra hotel in paso robles   it was so fantastic i had to get one for home   leaves your hair soft and dries it  in less time  i ve been looking for a powerful hair dryer and found this at a resort   i was happy that i found it online and it was so reasonable   i like the retraactable cord and hope it lasts   some of the reviews were negative on this   it leaves my hair dry in minutes and soft   more powerful than some of the other larger hair dryers i ve purchased  i wanted a bonnet hair dryer to deep condition my hair    i remember the one my mother had over 20 years ago   they sure dont make them like that anymore  that one provided full drying coverage it wasnt just blowing heat out the top and with a prayer and tilt of head forward hopes it drys the back and sides of the head too    which is what this one does   i was thinking of returning it but after researching others as it turns out they all seem to be like this   so ill keep it   it gets really hot when on the high setting  not the air the dryer itself  and on first use it tripped my electrical plug      i ve been searching for a great quality hair dryer and decided to give this one a try after reading all the great reviews  this product is every bit as awesome as people have said      i love it     i have shoulder length  curly hair and this dryer cuts my drying time in half  worth every single penny     my wife loves this new hair dryer   it blows her old hair dryer away   she has been very please   we have not issues with the product at this time   she uses it most days  i bought this product about a year now and i have to say there are other blowers that work better than this one that are way cheaper for the price it has a high pressure of hair coming out and it is light but it does not silk the hair no matter how much you go over the same section of hair i would not buy agian  and yes i am a dominican hair stylish i bought this for my wife and she really likes it  she says it s the best hair dryer she has ever used in her life  as prescribed it works well sofar will see how long it last  i use it on a daily basis handle pretty good only been using this for about a week now so i can t speak to the longevity of the dryer but i really love it so far   hair dryers have always been kind of hit and miss  mostly miss for me   they are usually not strong enough  or too hot  or not hot enough  or cheaply made  even expensive ones   etc   i have thick long hair and it takes forever to dry   this dryer is amazing   it has several settings and on the hottest  strongest setting i can dry my hair faster than any other dryer i ve had   but it doesn t get overly hot either   i don t feel like i m burning my hair and scalp as i have with other dryers   as someone who has been on the hunt for the perfect dryer for decades  i feel like i finally found one   i m tempted to buy a bunch so i have them for the future in case this one ever goes away  heats instantly  dries hair very quickly and it s much quieter than any other brand i ve ever had   well worth the price  so   my girlfriend has this really super thick  straight  shiny  enviable mane of dark red  beautiful butt length hair   she mantains it so thoroughly and with so much detail  her daily routine usually takes substantial effort and time  br    br   with our old high end hair dryer i started referring to this ritual of hers as hairnobyl because it raised the temperature of the bathroom 20 degrees  dimmed the lights  made me turn up the tv really loud  the dogs would hide in other rooms and communication was impossible  her mouth would move   but       after the 30 minutes of excruciating noise i was climbing the wall   not to mention a repetitive use shoulder pain she developed  br    br   then i bought her this dryer  br    br   her shoulder feels better because it s so much lighter  and it takes about half the time   it is also more effective   makes her hair really shiny  br    br   we now own two of these   they are great   she s an expert  and when she raves about a hair product   trust me   it is win  this is a very good hair dryer  especially if you are less accustomed to professional dryers  if you like myself have been buying conair or revlon dryers since you were a teenager then you ll appreciate a step up from those  this dries my hair quickly without an intense level of heat  better yet much less noise and a longer cord than my previous dryers  a solid purchase  a long time elchim user here  didn t think anything was better than the hot heat and forceful blow  well  this is better than that  fastest drying time ever  heat is right on  it is a little heavy  which frankly  none of the good dryers are light  so you can t really ding it on that  i have hair to below my shoulder blades  wavy frizzy  colored  and this makes it almost to the point of no flat iron  worth the price  just the best dryer ever  i am loving this blow dryer  my hair feels so soft and looks much more shiny     i m hoping it isnt like the other reviews and doesnt break in a few weeks bc i love this brand and will never buy another cheap walmart brand      i do not buy anithing without try it first  but this blower its really great  its fast and powerfull  and reduce the time of drying in half  i love this product  bought this to replace my reliable sunbeam 1500 wall mount hair dryer which lasted over 4 years   this model is the newer replacement version   newer but definitely not better  it lasted only 3 months before before it burned out  sparks  smoke and then death  cheaply made junk    i was really surprised when i received this hair dryer because the quality of the product  it is great br   the dryer is very affordable and has a great look and feel and puts out nice heat   i would definitely recommend this product to friends and am very happy with it  great product for the price  works great and has nice settings  it came with two snap on extentions which both work nice on my hair  well  this is an update to my previous review   this blow dryer has stopped blowing hot air  only blows cold now   it happened right after i pushed and held the cold shot button in for a minute  maybe less   i feel this dryer should have lastest longer  br    br   this little hair dryer is powerful  it s nice and petite  and the air is not too hot that it burns and not so cool that it doesn t dry well  it s the perfect temp   so far it is the best little hair dryer i have ever owned   the only draw back is that the cord doesn t retract  however  those usually break sooner than later  so i am happy  i ve been a stylist for 15 yrs and i can tell you nothing compares to this dryer in terms of closing the cuticle with added shine however i do recommend getting the twin turbo ionic for  30 more it s worth every penny  i couldn t be more happier and it s made in italy so the finest materials go into construction and you can feel it  the weight and the little kickback when turned on sounds crazy but this this is powerful  i have very thick hair and go through blow dryers quite frequently  i am always upset when i have to spend so much  75   on something i know i will have to replace  br    br   well this dryer has been wonderful  i have had it much longer than i have had any other blow dryer  also i can rest easy knowing that if i do have to replace it it is well within a reasonable price  br    br   thank you conair  la nano cer aacute mica i oacute nica seca el cabello tecnolog iacute a como ninguna otra  en vez de seco  paja como el pelo seco el andis proporciona un secado flexible y suave que hace que el pelo se siente muy sano y natural  this product was listed as a 2000 watt ceramic ionic hairdryer   it certainly had 2000 watts and was as loud and powerful as a jet engine in my bathroom   however  despite the power  the heat was lacking   and  it was so powerful  it was difficult to control fly aways   not recommended for curly hair where you are trying to control frizz and defeat humidity   too powerful  but not hot enough to help  awesome hair dryer  i have very frizzy hair  and this is the first blow dryer i have owned that actually helps to reduce frizz  my hair is almost frizz free after i blow dry  so i can just quickly run my flat iron over it rather than having to iron tiny sections to remove the frizz  the high speed is very powerful  and it dries my hair quickly  the retractable cord is a great feature so the cord isn t laying all over my counter when i m not using the dryer  the only reason i gave this 4 stars instead of 5  i would have liked to give it 4 75 if i could  is because it takes a little while to heat up  otherwise  this is a great product and i highly recommend it  while it may not be the most powerful or versatile hair dryer available  it is certainly the most convenient   i bought this as a replacement for the exact same model that lasted several years   my wife wanted this one replaced when the plastic internal fan blades broke apart  but that was after 5 10 years of regular use   my wife has one or two others that have specialty attachments  and are probably more powerful  but this is the one that she uses as the primary one  because it is always right there  nothing to pull out and plug in etc  it s just there and it is powerful enough to handle most every requirement  i use it infrequently but my short hair is dry in less than a minute  i bought 3 sunbeam 1500 wall mount hairdryer back in 2000 and had used them since  after a few years  use i noticed the plastic part got a small hole burnt  i found a way to still use it by letting it sit until it cooled down before placing it back into the mounting fixture  so based on the durability of the product i bought this model again expecting bunbeam to have improved in the design about the heat discipation  my previous 3 dryer are still working but i changed them all anyway  br   i m impressed with the new design   it becomes more stylish and after drying my hair when i hold the blow hole by hand it s just mildly warm   not hot at all  it is not a very quiet hairdryer but i m happy with the purchase  i expect to last 20 years  i have tried many types of hair dryers from inexpensive to professional   i have long medium thick hair   this one saves me so much time and my hair turns out looking healthy and shiny   i rarely use my straightener any more  i have used this product at three other facilities and it is a value for the cost  mounts easily and works as detailed  based on mostly positive reviews i purchased this hair dryer   usually the reviews on amazon are on target   not this time   this dryer appears to be well built and fits the space on my wall fine but has two major flaws that make me regret my decision to purchase  br   1  the night light is way too bright  br   2  more importantly  the air flow on the high setting is woefully inadequate for me     trying to dry my hair each morning during this hot summer has been no fun with this hair dryer barely pushing very hot air at me   it usually leaves me sweating with semi dry hair  br    br   i hate to waste hard earned money  but i m looking at trashing this unit and finding a replacement  i used to have a sunbeam model that worked great   br    br   good luck shopping  this hair dryer gave my hair great body but when it came to straightening it it fails  its really only because i have insanely thick hair  this product would probably work on someone with thinner and more tamable hair than myself  not the best hair drier i ve used it gets hot as you cornuie to use it but i wouldn t have purchased it if i was to look for a professional hair drier that can bring up the heat because this doesn t really do that  not bad  does a good job but feels a little cheap  description says full size dryer but could have a little more power  doesn t look or feel like a real expensive hair dryer    but i guess you can t really expect that for around twenty bucks  this is really a great hair dryer  i love the cool setting after drying my hair with the heat   would not trade it for anything  it works really good and makes my hair smooth  i recommend it  my hair has some waves and it makes it straight and doesn t smell like when i iron it  this is my second purchase of the sunbeam oster wall mounted hair dryer   after years of enjoying the wall mount in hotels  i decided to buy one for my bathroom at home   best thing i could have done   when my first one gave out   had to have another   plus   convenient  easy to use  out of the way of other things  and clean   minus   lower wattage means slower drying   would not like it for long  thick hair   cord could stand to be longer to stetch just a bit further   really like this product  i m a woman of color with healthy hydrated curly textured hair  it is essential that i have a high quality blow dryer to get a nice smooth blowout without frizz and no damage  i didnt expect anything from this  13 dryer  but figured what could it hurt to have something less bulky to travel with to the beach that works internationally  i used it at home a few times and i am impressed  i ve spent hundreds of dollars on t3  chi pro  superstar    and they all work great  well  while this isnt  100  comparable  its near 80  comparable  fantastic quality  this is one of your best bets for a good quality  high heat non damaging air flow cheap travel blow dryer that doesnt cost a fortune  i will say that my hair frizzed up much easier when i hit the dc humidity than it does when i use my other blow dryers  but still  a small  minor complaint given that it is less than  20  travels well without taking up space  and gets a decent temperature with good air flow  i really like this blow dryer  dried very quickly and felt that my hair was healthier than with my old blow dryer  but broke after 4 months of use  i used one of these at the marriot  and i loved it so much that i had to have one   love the power that it has and the folding handle  i have purchased two of these dryers within the last ten years  and they worked well 75  during that time   my hair is thick and slightly wavy  and it took fifteen minutes start to finish with a rounded air vent brush   the buttons moved easily  and the dryer s handle was comfortable to grip  br    br   the demise of these dryers was pretty much the same  fire the first time  sparks the second  which sounds pretty common considering the reviews on here   also  the medium heat setting was a bit too hot  and it sucked in too much hair  requiring me once to disassemble the unit for removal  i considered buying a third  but having generated sparks with the last two  i opted to purchase a different brand   overall  if you don t mind the potential electrical danger  it s a decent dryer for the price  other reviews indicate the advertising was in error as the unit did not include acool slection   the one we received did have this  the unit is extremely light and gets the job done  i m not sure if this hair dryer actually dries my hair any faster but  it sure makes it shinier   i also love the shape   placement of the cool button which i use to set the volume  this item was a great price and i was very happy with it for the first few uses   it dries my hair in half the time that i was spending with a drugstore brand   unfortunately  the tip of the nozzle is melting   it may be because it s made out of lightweight plastic   real bummer as i was so thrilled with its performance  best hair dryer i ve ever had  my first one lasted 12 to 15 years of daily use  lost count of how old it was  my guess that it died at age 110 in hair dyer years  i have owned two of these  this dryer is the best blow dryer i have ever had  but it lasts just about a year of gentle home use  same results with both dryers  for this price would expect it to last much  much longer  i would not call it professional quality  i bought this dryer after trying it at a hotel we stayed at   love the way it folds up and is easy to transport and store  great product at a great price i love this hair dryer  my first one finally died and i ordered the very same one because it performed so well and lasted so long  i highly recommend it  love this hair dryer  the different speeds are great and drys fast got it fast in the mail love that  i just love my new conair hair dryer  very sturdy feeling and the buttons controls work smoothly  much better hair dryer than my revlon 1875 which was awkward and cheaply constructed  i have always preferred the conair ion shine and am glad to have a new conair at a pricetag of  13     br   motor does seem quieter than my other hair dryers and the  cool shot  button is an added bonus  br   might just have to get another at this price     a little powerhouse  that stores its own cord  fits nicely in a drawer  and  so far  reliable   i used this model at the four seasons santa barbara  and was able to locate it on amazon   i ordered one for each of my bathrooms  i ve had this for a while now and it is still working perfectly  dries my hair quickly and doesn t leave it as frizzy when i use it with the included extension  the different heat settings are great too  i like having a cool option instead of just a cool button  as a hair dryer this is a good product  it has plenty of oomph it is not too loud  it looks good  br   but if you bought it like i did  for styling your hair  using the attachments that came with it  you will be disappointed  br   the boars hair bristle brush is the only useful attachment out of the 3 that come with it  the other two have barely any room between the bristles  and so unless you have extremely short hair  you are not going to be able to run it through your hair  so you are left with the boars hair brush  but that too  is pretty much useless  because the bristles are really long  and really weak  they don t get into your hair at all  rather they just skim over the top of it  after one use  those boar bristles were leaning every which way but straight  so the brush was effectively ruined after one use  br   i got a refund on it  everyone should own this hair dryer   throws out a lot of heat  works very well with afro american hair  the comb is very strudy  only complaint it is somewhat heavier than what i expected  this hairdryer was a good buy  i sent it to my sister and niece  they both have long  thick  curly hair and find the dryer strong enough to do the job comfortably  they tell me it was a good buy and they find it strong and a good performer  i love the yellowbird  i have very long hair and it holds up to drying my hair  as other dryers wind up overheating before my hair is dry  not this one  it is powerful  unlike many other dryers  and i love the cool setting that is continuous instead of being a cool shot   i would reccomend this dryer for anyone with thick  long hair  this hairdryer has all the features i want  retractable cord  powerful  folds up  cool botton and attractive   i bought mine over 5 years ago and used it every other day  and the cord and casing all are in excellent condition still  but the motor just died   i think over 5 years is a reasonable time  so i m bying the same one again  this dryer is constructed to be a first class item   works very well for many uses  we used it to remove vinyl letters from  our trailer   did a great job  i thought this hair dryer would be great for traveling because it folds and has the retractable cord   first hotel i plugged it in  the power in our room went out   second hotel  same thing   i didn t use it the rest of our trip   i tried it again when we got home   as soon as i tried to plug it in it sparked   in the trash it went   big waste of money  this dryer works great and saves space   i have one at our home and at our lake house   i love the night lite it has   its easy to hang on the wall and looks nice too  i did considerable research before choosing the andis rc 2 ionic 1875w ceramic hair dryer for my wife   she wanted a dryer that was easy to store and that would dry her hair quickly   so far it meets all of her expectations and we re very satisfied   we are being careful with the retractable cord as others have suggested  i give it 4 stars for everything but it is heavy  that is the only down side  br    br   i ve used this brand since my beauty school days  from salon work to freelance studio works  i ve found this brand to be the best  the brand has yet to fail me   it continues to be the most popular salon brand among the stylist  this blow dryer was purchased to replace a similar one       just love the fact that the cord retracts   it s not cumbersome  has two speeds and a cooling option   terrific value for the money  as a cosmetologist  we all need a professional blower  shipped a lot sooner than what i expected and worked perfectly fine  brand new product  great product   although  it has only 2 temps  low and high  which is not really too hot at all  i would ve preferred a medium in there  and then br   a hotter temp for high    but  all in all  this product is perfect for me   my hair is thin   i would order with them again for sure  package arrived in a timely fashion  love the product  professional correspondence with them  i purchased this a while back and still works great  i definitely would recommend to buy this product  worth the money and the item shipped fast     it could have been better for the price  it keeps burning my hair occasionally  a problem i never had with the previous dryers  i dont like it for that reason but otherwise it is fine  i bought a different dryer for primary use now  this is just for emergency use  i just love it  i was looking for a professional hair dryer for styling and it s exactly what i was looking for  the heat is just perfect and it keeps the hair shiny  this product works really good and the price is reasonable  i strongly recommanded  br   i will say this might be the best choice for product in this price range  this is an amazingly sturdy and powerful hair dryer   really dries my hair quickly and allows for easy styling   this one should last me a long time  love this  it s light weight which is nice and easy to use  i have a lot of hair  and it dries so fast with this hair dryer  would def recommend it  i have wavy curly hair and use a diffuser everyday so not to break up my curls    this hairdryer was actually too powerful  even on the lowest setting  for my delicate curls   if i was going to blow it straight i m sure it would have cut my drying time but for my type of loose curls  i needed the diffuser to diffuse more  it felt like the diffuser wasn t holding back any of the air  and the air not to be so powerful  on low    i ended up returning this hairdryer and going back to my original lightweight revlon   i wouldn t recommend this dryer to someone with fragile lightweight curls but i would recommend for everyone else  this dryer costs and weighs twice as much as my good old conair dryer that lasted me 15 years  but works no better  i wish i bought something else  it is bulky  heavy and slow  not sure why does the maker claim that the hair becomes shiny and silky because of their dryer  mine did not get better a single bit  br    br   update 5 months later  it slowed down substantially after 5 months in service  this replaced a hairdryer that s oh  about 25 years old and still working  gotta say  it s a welcome change  love the ionic aspect  and it leaves my hair very manageable  powerful but quiet motor  other reviewers have commented that it has a funny smell  i can t say i ve noticed  and there s never any reason to blow it in my face  so not a problem  love the soft feel of the housing  love the little rubber bumper that doesn t allow it to slide on the countertop  love the long cord     maybe i ll get 25 years out of this one  too  this little hair dryer really does the trick  i will admit for those with a thick head of hair this may not be the best option  but for me  with my long  thin and falling out hair its perfect  it doesn t get super hot which is good because my hair is easily damaged so having a hair dryer that does not scorch my hair is a plus  i have not owned a hair dryer for the last 10 years but i was told that by blow drying my hair it will help natural oils come out that air drying doesn t release and so far i am very happy with the product  it comes with a diffuser and other small attachment as well  i love it  initially purchased this for traveling since it has the ability to work with european voltage as well as us  i now use it every day  its light and powerful  highly recommend  my hair dryer broke a while ago and i finally decided to replace it with this one  i found it at walmart for  35  which wasn t the most expensive one that they had  but i ve used john frieda products before so i figured it would be a good try  so far  i really like this dryer  it feels like it could be a lot more expensive  br   i compared it to my mother s  80 or so hairdryer and it actually keeps up with it pretty well  i really like how the engine feels and sounds  it works pretty quiet and has a low hum rather than the high pitched noise a lot of cheap o hairdryers have  it doesn t shoot the air quite as fast and it doesn t get quite as hot as the  80 blowdryer my mom has  but it s pretty great at it s job because my hair actually looks better when i use this hairdryer vs the more expensive one  it definitely fights frizz very well  br   the only problem i d say i have with it is that it s a heavier dryer than my old one that broke  i say problem because people may dislike that but i prefer it that way  when dryers have a bit of weight to them i feel like they ve got a stronger motor  not to mention i really don t notice when i m using it  br   as for the people complaining about the buttons  i can t say that i can relate  i guess i have very small hands so i can hold the dryer pretty well without messing with the buttons too badly  but so far every blow dryer i ve seen has the buttons on the side pannel like that  i think you just have to get used to it  br   overall  awesome dryer  i m very happy i purchased it  works very good  i m and african american with permed hair  now ladies you know after we wash and blow dry our hair we normally have to flat iron it as well  but that s not the case with this blow dryer since i started using it i haven t flat ironed my hair  i just blow dry and i m out the door  i once told my cousin this and she said i looked like i when to the hair dresser  product works great  and drying and combing with one hand is absolutely awesome  the combs snap only firmly  i have no fear it will fall off even with my thick hair  this is my first hair dryer purchase in many years because i had curly hair  which i am now straightening  br    br   pros  dries hair quickly  i was using it on high for the first few weeks  but today i set the temperature to medium and my hair still dried fairly quickly   cute color  retractable cord  quick cool button  price br   cons  it seemed a bit heavy on the first day  but i got over that quickly br    br   i would recommend this product  this works awesome  great or long thick hair  i love the speed and the cooling feature actually works  others that ive had do not really feel cooler  this works great for a finished look  straightforward   not fancy  but powerful to handle my moisture soaked hair quickly  worth the price and so far is sturdy and works beautifully  lightweight so styling is easy and the dryer is easy to handle  at present  i am using this hair dryer at home   i like it so much that i am going to buy another one for my travel bag  when i visit family and friends i like to bring my own hair dryer so i keep one packed in my suitcase  br   this hair dryer is light and powerful   my hair looks better than it did when i used my previous dryer shinier and easy to manage  i was excited about getting this dryer after reading the reviews   ive been a hairdresser for 12 years so unfortunally i have carpal tunnel   this blowdryer is heavier than it says and it is very loud   at home use would be ok but in salon use    not so much   i actually returned this dryer to amazon  what is not immediately discernible from the supplied photos is that the intake bezel and control buttons are all molded in bright pink pearl colored plastic  that  and the fact that the box is printed in a all over floral pattern tells me that this item is targeted toward the women s market  i ended up returning it  i have only used this dryer once  but it works very well   my hair is fine so it doesn t take long to dry so this dryer does the job quickly   all in all  i m pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to others  i love this hair dryer  it is so light weigh and powerful that i am stiling my hair a lot faster than before  this hair dryer does the job   i wanted a small dryer with multiple heat settings and that is what i got   i knew it had 1600 watts when i ordered it  i wish it was a little bit more powerful   great for a mans short hair   for a woman with long thick hair you may want something with more watts   i have only had the dryer for several weeks   so far no quality issues   the guarantee on the box states 5 years   we will see   the price is so low for what you get if i get 2 years out of it i will be happy  i was disappointed with this blow dryer  after reading the good reviews about it  i thought it would be a safe purchase  wrong  first  the hardware to mount it to the wall is flimsy and hard to work with  tiny little screws  second  it is very underpowered  the best thing about it is the nightlight  bright enough so you don t have to turn another bathroom light on in the middle of the night  i did get 2 of them and they were on sale at the time so i kept them  i won t buy one of their products again  i purchased the black one via amazon and i am very pleased with the product so far  i ve always wanted a simple solution to great hair and this is exactly it  i used to own a conair from the drug store and this sedu has changed my perspective on hair dryers  i ve always thought that i can never re produce the kind of blow out that i get from salons but this hair dryer has made it possible  the air is pretty strong and i don t find the hair dryer heat up more than my drug store one  it does take most of the frizz away and my hair stays in a nice curve for the whole day when i use a round brush  br    br   to be fair though  this hair dryer more expensive so you would expect the higher quality to match the price tag  another thing i found is that it s actually kinda heavy for its size  my old one is bigger but actually weight about the same as this one  maybe even less  if you are looking for a feather weight  maybe this is not for you  other than that  i have no complaints  br    br   loving it so far  it makes me laugh that this product is touted specifically for men   it s colors might be manly  red  blue  and black   but the hair dryer works equally well for a man or a woman   my wife used it extensively  br    br   the dryer itself is very functional and excellent   i have had it for a couple months now  and it still works perfectly   with heat settings and a nice grip as well   the only reason i couldn t give it 5 stars is because they say it s for men   makes me laugh   still though  worth buying  i was really affraid to purchase this product on line  since its just coming out as one of pibbs newest editions  i must admit this blow dyer is hands down top of the line i work mainly with blowouts on natural hair clients im saying this blow dryer can straighten out the thickest kinky tightly coiled hair hands down  during the blow drying process the hair is left super shinny and super manageable  oh and not to mention the drying time  i m throwing the in towel on that one just made my job easier  super light weight  not heavy like the other dryers use to be  my dryer for ever love love love my new pibbs faster drying time more clients  fast money   i used this hair dryer for the first time at a hotel and just had to have one   i love it    it s lightweight  has a retractable cord and folds   great for travel or storage   i m on my 2nd one and bought a 3rd to keep just in case  what a fantastic hair dryer   it has the cooler setting  but with the same wind power as the high setting so you can get your hair dry and smooth without burning it   i have owned numerous dryers from vidal sassoon and conair and many other brands  however this is just the best and so well priced   thank you  thank you  thank you  andis  this t3 is easy to use and much lighter than other dryers  it dries faster and leaves the hair shiny  i love this hair dryer   i have fine  thin  hightlighted hair and it is the best blow dryer i have ever used   highly recommend  initial review   this hair dryer is perfect   it was extremely inexpensive   it s powerful   it has multiple settings   it has a cool shot   it is quiet   perfect  br   on second though  however   the operating buttons are awkwardly placed   while trying to dry your hair  your finger will inadvertently keep turning the blower off   extremely poor design  lightweight  quieter than most  and dries my hair in half the time  all dryers are not the same and this one is great for smoothing and straightening  i first discovered this hairdryer at the ritz carlton kapalua resort and loved it   i ordered one for myself as soon as i returned home   love the way it dries my hair without scorching  frizzing or so much pressure i can t style it properly   medium works great for me   also loved the folding handle as my bathroom space is limited   as others have mentioned  be careful not to pull the cord out too far  as mine stopped retracting after 18 months   with almost 3 years of daily use  it finally died   i immediately ordered another one   at this price  one every 3 years is a bargain  this hair dryer is very quiet  drys quickly  prevents frizz and includes two attachments all for an extremely low price  it s the best hair dryer i have ever used  added bonus  the cord reeler function makes storage a breeze  a must have  i like this little hair dryer  it is small  lightweight and easy to use  the controls are in a good place and it does a good job  i only gave it four stars because even on low it blows pretty hard and is hotter than i would like it to be  for the price  it was a good enough deal  i wanted a ceramic dryer because my old dryer was dryng out my hair and making it appear dry and course   i purchased this ceramic  ionic dryer to protect my hair and also achieve br   a softer look  itgave the results that i was looking for  it certainly works  also a good feature it the automatic cord wind  i am very pleased  the dryer was reduced in price and br   this made the purchase sweeter as it is a great product at a bargain price  br   i would certainly recommend this dryer and it deserves the 5 star rating  this is the 2nd one i ve bought and the first from amazon   i loved the first one and had it for many years   i paid less with amazon for this one and even though the first one hadn t stopped working it started to smell hot and i didn t want to take a chance   i will continue to purchase this product as long as it s available   my hair is long and it takes no time at all to dry and looks great  it s not as quiet as some of the very high end dryers  but it s still quieter than most  br    br   one of the things i like most about this dryer is the 3 position heat setting   you can get reasonably cold air without having to hold down a spring loaded button  which gets kinda old  it does what it s supposed to do  it s light weight and fairly easy to handle  i would have given it 5 stars except that the cord tangles a bit while using it  maybe it will loosen up after a while i don t know  but right now it s kind of annoying  also it doesn t have a cool air button  which it didn t claim to have one so it s not their fault  but i didn t think of it checking when i read the description  br    br   for the money it s a great item  i would recommend it to anyone looking for a simple hair dryer  i got this hoping it would be a good replacement for my last blow dryer that i loved  and had for 3 years  i like the bendable handle and retractable cord  the setting are nice but it randomly shuts off while im using it    ill have it on medium heat on high and its like it over heats or something  its horrible for when im in a hurry getting ready for work because it takes at least 10 minutes to cool down enough for it to turn back on  and its not the outlet  or the fuse  i can take it to every outlet in my house and it still wont work until it cools down  but for the price i guess i shouldnt have expected any better  my hair dryer finally died after   well  i m not sure how old it was    maybe 25 years   read many of the reviews on this and decided to give it a try   excellent hair dryer  it has a cooling button to set the curl which i forgot about   the first time i used it i styled half my head and suddenly remembered this button   which is actually very easy to use  takes less than 10 secs   the first time i tried it the curl was definitely much better then what i had just using the heat   i had to go back and redo the first half and was so pleased   the blow dry was excellent  it didn t fall during the day  the bounce was still in my hair the next day  after sleeping on it   br    br   i never had this good a blow dry with any of my older dryers  so the new construction really does make a difference   dried my hair in half the time  br    br   the only reason i gave it 4 stars is the design of the handle   it s much narrower than my old dryer  making it difficult to handle and difficult to get to the cooling button   i m hoping i get used to it over time because it kinda keeps slipping in my hand  good power   easy to handle   settings don t get in the way of the handle   this is the third one i ve bought  while looking for a hair dryer comparable to the one that just tryed to electrocute me  i found this one  the price was great and it had all the features of the much more expensive one i d just thrown away  i d give it a higher review but i found the on off switch to be in an awkard position  it is a powerful hair dryer and well worth the money  this is an excellent product  and we also received excellent service   we have a few items already from this company andis  and are extremely happy with all of them  i ve been using conair infiniti pro for over 10 years  still works perfectly fine  recently  i decided to buy one more for my 2nd bathroom  and bought conair ionic ceramic styler  this new unit died on day 1  i returned it and bought a new conair infiniti pro again  br    br   reminds me of the saying  buy expensive  cry once  buy cheap  cry every day decent hairdryer  it gets really hot  doesn t have separate buttons for air level and heat level  instead it has one heat setting  only one button that toggles between off high and low  the comb attachment is pretty flimsy and will have to be replaced as the teeth in the comb breaks pretty easily  i use this on my daughters hair  we are black and she has natural thick and curly hair  i bought this hair dryer after some research  it is extremely light  not very noisy  and the buttons are in the right place  the cord is a little short  about 62 inches  but for a tiny new york bathroom with an electrical outlet at a waist level it is actually perfect  however  i can see how it can be trouble if your electrical outlets are low  br    br   i can t tell if the ionic feature does what is supposed to do because i had not owned a hair dryer before this one for a long time so i can t compare  i have very thick just below the shoulders hair and it takes me about 5 minutes to dry it  it still gets static in winter  br    br   i like the simple white and black color  to me it looks much better than the silver finish on higher end driers because they still look like plastic and fake and this one is not pretending to be what it is not  the painted text to identify on off and temperature settings wore off in two days but the settings are intuitive and so you don t really need the text once you saw what is where  i ve had it for just under a year and it is working just fine  all in all great purchase  love these dryers  had one for 9 years  finally burned out  just bought 2 more  so convenient to have it right there on the wall  and the night light is a bonus  my old conair ceramic hair dryer just died after about 4 yrs  thought i would try this ionic dryer  i ve used it for about 3 wks now   have noticed no improvements to my hair  my hair is always shiny  so who can say  but as for frizzies or static hair  i have some issues   they were not improved by using this dryer  as others have said the buttons are a challenge to not press when using  you have to hold it by the sides only  also the high speed is not much different from the low   neither blow that much air compared to my last dryer   many others i have had  but for what i pd it is a decent dryer  nothing special  but it gets the job  of drying  done  this hair dryer does a very good job  it has multiple settings for heat and fan speed  very good value  my wife and i always comment on how nice the hair dryers are in a hotel  this is exactly what we were looking for  it pretty much cuts the drying time in half from our old hair dryer  i travel fairly frequently  so hotels are a routine affair  i saw this hair dryer at a hotel recently  its performance was impressive for its size  as soon as i got home i ordered one  i found the included mounting kit  screws  3m tape  dry wall anchors  a little flimsy  i used a better wall anchor to mount the dryer  br    br   all was well for 3 days  the hair dryer worked like a champ  until the third day when the on off switch blew up in my hands  the switch had shorted out  causing a large poof of smoke fire  this of course happened just after i had tossed the original packaging and amazon shipping box  so i contacted the manufacture about a replacement  they were very interested in getting this dryer to the corporate offices asap  they sent out fedex the next day to pick up the device to be sent back  i just received my replacement device  it took 15 days in total to receive it  br    br   i really hope this one lasts a bit longer  br    br   edit  i added photos to the product page showing how the switch blew up  this dryer was a great one during the 8 months that it worked  loved the retractable cord and how fast it could dry my overly thick hair  br    br   usually when i burn up a dryer  i have some notice  burnt motor smell  maybe some popping noises   but not this one  it worked fine yesterday  and today would not work  checked the outlets  did the test reset on the dryer and that worked  but the dryer itself is dead  reviews at other sites show this to be a non uncommon problem  i bought this for my upcoming overseas trip to paris as this blowdryer was cheap and fit my criteria of being dula voltage with ceramic technology  i have average hair that does get pretty wavy  sometimes looks like i took it out of a braid  plugged it in and it started right up here in california  will probably use this blow dryer more instead of straightening my hair  br    br   pros  works well br   leaves my hair smooth and frizz free br   retractable cord is convenient br   speed and heat settings br   folding handle br   switch to switch over to different voltage is easy to find br    br   cons  haven t found any lol br    br   it is a bit heavier then my other blowdryer but nothing that i would complain about  will update this once i use it in paris  i did read in the manual that when used in the 210 250v areas the settings have to be kept on low and on hot but we ll see if it is an issue  i bought this hair dryer having read the wonderful reviews   it took forever to come and then didn t live up to expectation   i was hoping to solve my frizz problem and speed up the drying time  but i didn t think this hair dryer did either   i sent it back and was pretty annoyed that they only refunded me  64 of the  88 i spent on it   they charged me a restocking fee and a shipping fee when i already paid  11 to send it back myself   all in all  a lousy deal  none available  what is so exciting about a hair dryer  what a difference it makes in shine  silkiness and styling   i read reviews on hair dryers priced from     to    i chose this dryer based upon consistently good reviews  benefits  features and price   this dryer changed my baby fine  thin hair that frizzes in humidity and loses volume in dry climates to lovely  silky brilliantly shiny locks   i know  it sounds far fetched  but for me  this dryer delivered what it claimed   thank you to all that reviewed this product over the months   you helped me choose a great hair dryer   before those of you in the market for a new hair dryer plunk down  200 or even  50 for a hair dryer  try this one   i don t think you will be disappointed  used this product for the first time at the hilton in new york city  works great  very powerful   i like the retractable cord very nice   would recommend highly great price also  i m really enjoying the use of this product  it heats well and i m usually dry in 30 minutes  i love how light weight it is  because i can hold it in my lap while i either work on the computer or watch tv  i was looking for a hair dryer that was gentler on my hair since i tend to use a flat iron on it daily   i was using one of the cheapest hair dryers you could buy and once i started using this one  there was a noticeable difference   it s much quieter and the varied heat controls are very useful   it s also a cute color that is very close to the picture   it seemed a little heavy a first compared to my cheap hair dryer  but you get used to it   and of course  it s always nice to have a retractable cord   i m very happy with this hair dryer so far     this dryer has a lot of power  it blew my hair extremely straight  i like the older model  but this newer version is just as good  this product is lighter and easier to handle  my only issue is   the shipping was slow  i purchased this product because quite a few of the youtube vloggers i follow use recommended it  i liked that it dried my hair well and that it had 4 different settings from cool to hot  but i found that if you hold it by the nozzle end like i do  it heats up alot  i used it primarily on the warm setting applying the tension method to my  4b 4c  hair and it was fine  i accidentally had it on the hot setting initially and that was too much heat for my hair  there s not much that s special about this dryer  but overall  it s a powerful  not too pricey option if you are looking for a professional style hairdryer  bought this hair dryer over a year ago and my husband and i have used it br   everyday since with no problems   it is easy to fold when we travel and br   love the fact that the cord retracts   i decided to go ahead and order a br   second one to have on hand when this one goes out because with my luck br   it wouldn t be available then  and i really like it  i had been looking to purchase a blow dryer for our spare bathroom and trailer when i found this one i was so happy it has exceded all my expectations  it was such a good deal  i am very pleaswed with the product and how fast it arrived  this hair dryer is a very powerful unit that exceeds all my expectations  i am so glad i got this unit from conair  the dryer arrived before the specified date and i use it all the time to dry my hair  it was the best purchase i made in a while   it straightened out my very coaurse hair   i love how hot it gets   i don t even have to apply a flat iron to my hair no more   great folding hair dryer for a great price   i needed a hair dryer to take on the fantasy carnival cruise   the glory had a hair dryer in the drawer but unfortunately the fantasy did not   it is going on another cruise this fall on the same fantasy  it s nice to find a home appliance that actually works as advertised  this remington dryer does that and more  br    br   it s very well made  it s easy to operate  and it dries hair very fast  we ve had this for a couple of months and it s held up quite well with almost daily use from someone in the household  good value for the price  too  this helps us from having stuff all on the top of our bathroom countertop  since we have limited counter top in this bathroom  we had one before that hung on the wall of the bathroom  our motorhome   great for organization   small places  i originally used this dryer last year at a 5 star hotel in chicago and loved it  so i asked the desk clerk if i could purchase a new one from the hotel  yes   my daughter and i seem to want to use it at the same time  so i ordered another one so we wouldn t have to fight over it in the mornings      highly recommended because it is small  has great blowing power  has appropriate heat  folds in half  and has a retractable cord  the hair dryer does exactly what it s intended to do  however  the product description is inaccurate  the so called cool shot button does not exist on this product  one thing which i noticed though is that the product image was updated with the blue cool shot button removed in the new image  i needed a dryer with a diffuser attachment to dry my permed hair  so after looking at a bunch of different ones on amazon i chose this one  i think it s a great dryer for the cost  the diffuser works well and keeps my hair curly without making it too frizzy  it also dried it fairly quickly  i didn t like how long the cold shot button took to work  it would also be nice if it got hotter for the lower setting  overall  for the price  i think this was a great buy and i m very happy with it  the john frieda jf1 does all it says it will  shiny hair with no static  dries quickly without the high pitched roar of other dryers  the overall look is very nice  just one major problem   its very heavy  if you are in it for the long haul as with long thick hair styling you better be young and strong  i am over sixty and have medium length fine hair and i find it easier to just use the curling iron on most days  if you are not using the blow dryer for styling it works just fine and comes with several heads for specific drying  i m very picky with my blowdryers  it always seems like they re either too hot  not hot enough  or don t give enough pressure to mold my hair  this blowdryer suffers from none of those problems  on top of the high quality drying it delivers  it is also very comfortable to hold  most blowdryers have hard plastic handles that can slip easily  especially after a shower  but this one has a nice rubber texture to it  i ve been using my mangroomer for a couple of months now and i am thoroughly satisfied with it  highly recommended  this is the first blow dryer i ve ever had  it s simple and pretty effective  i gave it 4 5 stars because i was a little confused with how to make it work  great for the price  it has only two settings  low and high  i ve used the low setting only  i wish it had had a better explanation for how to make it start working  otherwise  it s great  no complaints  personally love the product compares to the old dryer that i have  also good for the price   great for short hair  curl too nice hairdryer but it is very heavy to hold up for too long   if you have short fine hair  you can tolerate the weight  but if your hair is thick  mid length to long requiring longer drying times    holding this heavy dryer up for extended periods will make the job more laborious than it needs to be   i prefer my old revlon ionic pro sylist  i am getting the funny smell on high as others have described  in addition to the high heat setting possibly being too much for the hardware to handle  it s also hotter than i can handle  br   the fan speed and temperature are linked  as there is only one switch  the low speed is too low  but you have to use high heat to use the higher speed  bought this for my wife  who liked the product until three of the plastic fan blades broke after 15 months of use  most likely just one broke off  and its rattling around inside the housing immediately caused others to start breaking  now the dryer is worthless  the warranty was for one year  so no luck there  and replacement parts cannot be found  maybe 15 months is ok for a hair dryer at this price point  i don t know  i m buying another  and hope it breaks in under 12 months this time  this little hair dryer was exactly what i was looking for  small  easy to travel with  and not too loud   i checked for other travel size type hair dryers  but found that many of them were too big and wouldn t reach from a floor plug outlet up to the mirror because of the recoiled cord   this little hair dryer was perfect for my needs and does a great job of drying my hair and not making it frizzy as well   i was prepared for any color to show up  but was pleased to get a white one with red details  i am satisfied with this dryer  i don t see the need for anything fancier than this  besides  it s pink so that gives it triple bonus points in my book  after several years of daily used  my trusty conair 1875 finally quit on me   knowing that over the years there had been many an upgrade to hand held blow dryers  i spent about half a day reading through all the reviews on amazon and checking out consumer reports  the latter being not much help in this area  i have to say    this little jewel seemed to fit my needs   quiet  light  multiple temperature selections and speeds  and a cool setting  too   plus  it had that fancy shmancy ion stuff that s supposed to make your hair shine  although my thought on that was  yeah  right    i have to admit  too  that i am partial to conair as i have found that they last for years and provide a nice powerful flow of air that helps me style my usually short hair   well  this new conair 173rz ion shine ceramic turbo hair dryer is now my new love   it blows through my hair like a strong wind and the temperatures range from hot to cool with a perfect warm in between  my usual setting    the slide temp power selection system is not my preference  as my thumb sometimes slips and i end up with the wrong setting for a second  but i am getting used to it   it gets my hair dry in less than a minute   while the dryer is not what i would call a whisper  it is not as loud as my previous conair and for that i am thankful   a nice little extra is that it folds in half at the top of the handle   great if you have storage issues   but  the most surprising thing of all is that my hair actually does shine when i m done   i have salt and pepper hair and the salt gleams like sparkling silver threads afterwards   what a treat   so  i gave this baby five stars and hope to have it around for four or five years like all the other conairs before it  i m a hairstylist  and twinturbo 3200 is one of the best blow dryer out of all brands  if anybody likes to get fast and quality style  this is the perfect product  it s powerful and last longer      i loved it my main issue with this blow dryer is that the attachments slide off easily  i have natural textured african american hair  when i blow dry my hair i split my hair into 6 sections and use a quarter size amount of grapeseed oil in my hair as a natural heat protector  i think the dryer is great for the price but i wish that the attachments were able to lock on way better than they do  when this dryer kicks the bucket i will not repurchase because it is really annoying to keep sliding the comb attachment back on    ugh  just bought this hair dryer for my upcoming trip   i needed something with dual voltage  it arrived in approx 30 hours through prime shipping  tested it out tonight and loved it  i have thick course hair that generally dries moderately straight  but i straighten it to smooth it down  this hair dryer nearly eliminated my need to straighten my hair  it dried quickly and straight  no frizz  hardly any flyaways  and super soft  i m very pleased and definitely recommend this product  just hope it ll hold up to the english weather  it is faster compared to my old one  the cord doesn t use extra space as it rolls inside  which i find very convenient  it s definitely not as good as the last conair 1875 watt dryer i had for 4 5 years  the dryer doesn t feel as powerful and the high setting feels more like the low setting on my old dryer  i ve had this dryer for two and a half years  and it just died  but that s not bad for a hair dryer  i went out and bought another the same day  it s the best i ve ever had for my short  fine hair  the hot setting isn t overly hot  and the cool setting does a nice job of setting my style  excellent product and frankly deserves attention br   the experiences of this product i am relieved a lot br    and all my friends who saw him aaajabu i ve been using this hair dryer for over a year and i still love it   the cord reel is my favorite feature   it also has high  medium  and low heat seatings and 2 speeds  i owned a remington for 5  years and it quit on me so i purchased this dryer from my local store because it was reasonably priced and it had the reel style cord   well i have only owned it for 3 months and it has decided to quit on me there is a short in the cord somewhere and if it is not plugged in just right it will not work   i had to go out and purchase a new dryer i went with the remington again  i love the hair dryer  fits the wall perfectly  cord is long enough   hangs on hook when not in use  br   for the ones that do not like the night light on the base  you can push the test button which will turn the light off   then push the reset button to turn it back on   or to use the dryer  the john frieda jf1 hair dryer is a lightweight hair dryer with a sleek design and ceramic heat technology   unfortunately  the concentrator has a tendency to get hair stuck in the space in between the concentrator and the barrel of the dryer  then pull hair out   while it does dry pretty quickly  there isn t a noticeable difference in how shiny or voluminous it makes hair look   it s also pretty loud  br    br   the buttons could use re working as well  and would be better as switches  rather than buttons   the temperature and speed buttons are prone to being switched on accidentally   on the plus side  the hinged filter makes it easy to clean and the cord is a generous length   8 feet   br    br   overall  the john frieda jf1 isn t an overly impressive hair dryer and i wouldn t recommend it for the price  if i had to describe my hair  i d simply describe it as chronically curly  my old dryer used to make my hair more knotted and yuck but this dryer actually makes my hair super soft  drying time is 50  shorter and my hair generally seems more healthy  it doesn t burn my hair and the cord doesn t tangle much  loving this dryer  highly recommended  hi  br    br   based on being happy with a previous order of the smaller and louder andis 30925 hangup 1600w wall mount hair dryer with night light  ordered this as a replacement  br    br   this unit is like it s from a totally different company and i m not happy  br    br   the button to cut off the power is flimsy and you have to muscle it  i used to turn the unit off to shut off the bright night light   but the button is like screwed up   maybe its just mine but its not easy to use anyway  br    br   the night light is way too bright for one   it s like having a small table lamp on  so way to much to be called a night light  br    br   also  the mounting is different   you install a plate first  then screw the unit onto the plate   it was hard for me to do compared to the other andis unit i got and then after a while it started to come loose  br    br   if i had to guess  andis purchased this product from some other company and slapped their name on it   big mistake because i had been very loyal based on installing a few 30925 units around the house  br    br   i m returning this and trying the conair 134r unit which got great reviews  br    br   sorry andis   you d better up your game to keep customers loyal  the hairdryer is great  i like the tightly coiled cord and the peg to hang it over so br   that is doesn t drag in the sink  however  the green nightlight is entirely too bright  br   i have to hang a hand towel over it at night to keep it from lighting up my whole br   bedroom  it is much brighter than the previous andis wall mount dryer that i had br   previously  this hair dryer is undoubtedly a great price and it does get the job done   i haven t had any fuss with the fuse or anything and i supposed it s nice having the kind of fabric  not really   suede like   feel of the hair dryer  vs  plastic  for wet hands   that said  the buttons used to operate this thing are impossible   if you ve recently put lotion on your hands then you can just forget it   seriously    more than once have had to use a butter knife to operate it  my friends and my mom have had the same troubles   i would definitely pay  5 for one with better buttons  i first used this hair dryer at a hotel i stayed in recently  i liked it so much that i did an online search for it and discovered that amazon carried it  it has a nice feel in the hand  not too heavy  with a comfortable handle  i really like that it has 3 speeds  it also has a cool blast button  but i don t use that  it is also quite quiet for a hair dryer  one of the best features is the retractable cord  now i don t have a mile of cord snaking all over my countertop and down the front of the cabinet  i bought this dryer even though i had recently bought a revlon that i wasn t crazy about because it was too large and quite loud  very happy with this  i hope it lasts as long as my conair that died after 15 or so years  we had the previous model for over 5 years   worked every day till the heating element broke   so we had to replace it   new unit is only improved   uses the previous mounting hardware on the wall   we expect great things for this replacement  this hair dryer works great  i have long thin hair and i am quite happy with the performance of this dryer and its settings  the hot temperature is hot without being too burning  and the high blows just the right amount of air  i actually like using the hair dryer with the concentrator on it and that s something i haven t been able to say about any of the last other models i ve owned  i also feel like it dries my hair without leaving it frizzy  but there is only so much i can judge on that since my hair is long  thin  and straight  overall  very happy with the product  i bought a chi ion  low emf blow dryer in 2005 when another one of my cheap blow dryers broke   i was fed up having cheap blow dryers that never lasted  i loved the blow dryer  it lasted me till a month ago  guess the  110 i paid for it back then was worth the 6 years i got out of it  i was looking at buying the same one or at least a chi blow dryer again  i just didn t want to spend the same amount of money  i was hoping to stay under  60  i did a bunch of research and saw that this blow dryer  t3 featherweight  was on the list of best blow dryers the last few years and saw the price was close to what i wanted to pay and  30 cheaper than the chi i had before  i also saw that it said it was a fast drying blow dryer like my old chi  which i prefer since i have a ton of hair  after using it for over a week  i think it works pretty good   not much difference from my chi i had  it s lighter than my chi and it s made of some kind of plastic like material  it also looks solid white and black in the picture  but it s actually got some kind of silver pattern going on over the white which i m not thrilled with  but it s not the reason i bought the blow dryer so i ll get over it  seems to take about the same amount of time to blow dry my hair as the chi  maybe a little faster  i usually take about 8 15 minutes to blow dry my hair depending on how detailed i get with it  like i said i have a ton of hair   thick mid back length hair  br    br   why i give this a 4 instead of a 5  i prefer my chi a little more  maybe it s the solid feel of it  i think it s maybe the material  it feels too light  br    br   the biggest test is going to be to see how long it last  if it makes it 5 years   then i will be happy with it  i purchased this based on a write up in prevention magazine   yes  a great dryer with lots of shine but the locations of the control button stink   i spend more time reselecting the temperature speed on   off  as no matter how you hold this dryer  you are pressing a switch   i would recommend this to no one   it s just poorly designed  i really wanted to love this hair dryer  and i do except for one thing  the placement of the control buttons is terrible  i constantly turn off the dryer and switch the heat settings with my hand while i m drying my hair  it is pretty annoying   besides that  the dryer is great  it helps to smooth my hair and dries it quickly  it also looks really nice  overall  it is okay  but i don t think i would have purchased it had i known about the problem with the control buttons  well  i haven t used it long yet  i m still using it  it works well  but hard to put in all those extra feature to blow dry my hair  we ll see how good long it will last me    i have really long hair but this dryer dries my hair very quickly  it also makes my hair a lot smoother  i would definitely recommend to others for its price and quality  i have had multiples of this hair dryer over the past 5 years or so   it works well   has a reasonable amount of power   and is great for travel  because it is so compact   that said  i would not give 5 stars  because it always goes south and inevitably eventually just loses steam and then dies altogether   i have found that it can be somewhat inconsistent in power delivery   that appears to be a constant feature of this particular design  for whatever reason   still  i like and use these and do recommend them with that caveat  i first used this hair dryer at courtyard marriott  it worked so good and did wonders for my hair  i was thrilled to see that amazon was selling these  it dries my hair fast and gives it a silky smooth look  i highly recommend this hair dryer  i saw this dryer in good housekeeping magazine and decided to give it a try  even though i was pretty happy with my current 1875 watt dryer   this one really is better   dries faster  and seems very gentle   the cooling feature is great for setting curls and body  br    br   i ordered a second dryer for my daughter  but when it came there was an unpleasant buzzing sound when running on high speed   i knew this wasn t right   i contacted amazon about the defective product  return shipping was free and easy  and a replacement arrived in two days   thanks  amazon  overall  i like the dryer  the only thing i don t like is that they have changed the design  the newer design is much wider on the wall and it doesn t fit in the same screw holes so you have to drill more holes in the wall  overall i found this dryer to be well built  powerful unit though a bit on the heavy side   being a bit of a procrastinator when it comes tto getting haircuts  my hair tends to get fairly long between cuts and this dryer worked quickly and did a good job  br    br   since it s very similar to the unit my wife uses  and i use now and then  i m sure it would be fine for her use as well  br    br   not sure what the point of the ion setting is all about  doesn t seem to make any difference when i used it   but it s there  br    br   if i needed a new dryer  this would fill the bill  i was extremely excited to try out this product and i have to say  i have been impressed with it  i normally set the blow dryer to it s highest and warmest setting  and i am very pleased with the performance of this dryer in that regard  it is extremely powerful  but it doesn t get too hot or overheat if i don t move it constantly  a nice feature that many other dryers i ve used don t have  i don t personally use the add on attachment  so i can t comment on it  but it seems like it would be a useful tool for those who needed that specific form of styling  hairdryer is not as quiet as claimed  easy to handle  buttons seem to be in the wrong place  since i continually turn dryer off accidentally while attempting to dry hair   drying capabilities are good  i would give the item no more than a c   have definitely had better hairdryers   will most likely purchase another   much quieter one and keep this as a back up  br   not recommended if someone is concerned about noise levels  my old dryer  my very old dryer   needed to be replaced and i decided for the price  this was worth a go   plus  this dryer was rated top 10 on several sites i looked into  br   bottom line  it works  it s quiet  the cord retracts  it s not heavy         does it do the dishes   no  it doesn t and maybe i should complain about that   but seriously  it s    a    hair dryer   the one thing i can see is that if you were used to a hair dryer that just blew hot air  you might think this dryer makes your hair flatter   it doesn t cook your cuticle so your hair does lay flatter and ultimately  feels softer   but less damage is worth it  you can always adjust your products or hair style   well worth the  20 i paid  this a wonderful little dryer at a remarkably low price  it is quiet and efficient  this is a very  good buy     recommended  my sister in law is a hair stylist and swears by this brand but when i used the dryer  it didn t do anything special for my hair at all  in fact  it made it look so flat and left my hair without any body   my hair felt smooth and soft  but it didn t necessarily look that way  even on the highest setting there s not a whole lot of power  it blows less air and doesn t get as hot as my previous dryer   i had an elchim and it was definitely better   not sure if the wattage has much to do with it  this is 1875 and my elchim was 2000   but the 1875 should be fine for my hair since it s normal and not too thick  if you want the flat  straight ironed look and have thicker hair  this might work for you   for the price i paid  i wasn t impressed   for the record  my sister in law s dryer performs much differently  even though it s the exact same model   that makes me suspicious that perhaps this was a refurbished dryer or maybe even a fake if that s even possible  the box was not sealed  though the packaging inside was fine  i d be interested to hear if anyone else had the same experience  the dryer does not look very sturdy  inferior plastic  also when using dryer the cap became very soft and felt like it was melting  powerful and very lovely to use  highly recommend  i just used it for the first time today and it dried my hair very quickly     i read so many reviews on this hair dryer before i bought it and i purchased it anyway despite the fact that several people noted it died shortly after purchase   so mea culpa   here are the positives  br    br    it s very light br    br    generates great heat br    br    love the extra long cord br    br    they provided extra filters when i purchased it which i thought was a good thing but     br    br   now the negatives  br    br     even if you change the filter regularly  hint  hint with the included extras   mine died after a year  br    br     it s passing was very dramatic and looked like it was going to catch on fire  and smelled like it too  br    br   so it s great as long as it works  until it doesn t         i m no hairdryer expert  but this fit my needs perfectly  it folds and retracts nicely and dries my hair quickly  i was thrilled with this low cost  lightweight and well performing dryer   it is perfect for everyday use and travel   however  it stopped working after only two months of moderate use   disposable should be added to the product description  i did quite a bit of research before pulling the trigger on a new hair dryer  i was a bit hesitant to get a fold able travel dryer since their reviews don t tend to be as good  however this one was the exception  which is why i went for it  the main features i was looking for in a new dryer was the weight  size  power and i would prefer it to be a ceramic dryer since they are healthier on your hair  my old dryer was the vidal sassoon vs501 1875w ionic sensor touch dryer  the vs501 lasted me several years and technically it still works  i ve dropped it enough times that the front cover has broken making it a bit difficult to work the buttons  below i have compared the two dryers  br    br   conair 173rz vs  vidal sassoon vs501 br    br   conair 173rz pros  br   lighter and smaller than the vs501  which is easier on my arm br   puts out more air than the vs501 br   folds up for easy storage and travel br    br   conair 173rz cons  br   not as hot as the vs501  but still drys hair just as fast if not faster due to the air flow br   shorter cord than the vs501  which unless you need it can make it easier to store br    br   overall summery  br   the conair is a great buy with the features of a full size dryer packed into a small  fold able  lightweight design  the color isn t my favorite  but the fact that it meets all my criteria and i can take it with me when i travel makes up for it  there is not much i require of a hair dryer  just one that dries hair quickly and has options for heat and airflow level   i m not sure the high priced hairdryers actually perform any better than this one which costs less than  20   great buy in my opinion  this product was a worthy buy  it is inexpensive and not heavy duty  great for everyday use and it s light weight makes it easy to pack for travelling  two settings  low hot or high hot  it s really featherweight  quick drying time but the motor doesn t sound as good as my old italian made dryer  i wish i had tested it out in person first before buying i would return it but i got it for a song and don t want to pay the shipping cost and 15  restocking fee  it ll do  when i bought my first t 3 i paid  220 00 at a hair salon  i was told it was hands down  the best blow dryer  it was awesome  but after 3 years i started having problems  i certainly didn t want to pay 200 00 dollars again but the drug store dryers were not powerful enough for my hair      so my daughter encouraged me to try amazon  i never thought i would find the t 3 on amazon but to my surprise i did find it  i was able to get a brand new  perfect t 3 for 64 95 from discount jungle  i was a little nervous till i got it but it was perfect  it works better than the one i got from the salon    i feel like i got the deal of my life  my husband purchased this dryer for me  within a couple of uses it stopped blowing hot air  he reminds me all the time how much money he spent and how it can t be used  confession time  i am not a man  i don t even know a man who uses a hairdryer  so i don t know why this is for men  that being said  this is the best hairdryer i have ever used  don t ask me to explain what that ionic setting does   the manufacturer doesn t even explain it to my satisfaction  but  somehow  it does work on my cobweb fine  delicate  difficult  body less  totally straight  almost waist length hair  i wear it long and braided so i can ignore it as much as possible  and so it doesn t fly around all the time and get tangled in stuff or end up in people s food   i only wash it once a week because it s so darn dry   it would probably all fall out if i washed it every day  i don t perm  color  or otherwise mess with it because chemicals just destroy it  i ve had the split ends of my braid knot up so badly in the wind that i ve had to cut an inch or more off  most hairdryers are really hard on my hair  so i use them as little as possible  br    br   i like the design of this hairdryer   it s fairly light  comfortable to hold  and the attachment nozzle is nice for focusing the air where i want it  there s nowhere my hair can fly into the works and get tangled  i use the ionic setting with the heat on high  and control the amount of hot air with the handy cool burst blue button that turns the heat off  my hair dries faster and untangles easier than it ever has in my life  not only that  but it stays untangled all week  how is this possible  i don t know  i don t care  br    br   i thought maybe i was imagining all this  so i asked my daughter in law to try it  she said  that was the best experience i ve ever had with any hairdryer in my whole life  br    br   please don t comment that this can t possibly work and it s all unscientific and that i m making stuff up  as someone has on one of my other reviews  for me  this hairdryer makes a positive difference  pun intended  on my hair  now i m going to buy one for my daughter in law  performs great   no problems   light is perfect brightness   1200 watt setting works just fine   great space saver   used in hotels and great for kids bathrooms  i usually look up consumer reports on most of my purchases   over the years they have proven to be trustworthy and my purchases at their recommendation has saved me money and headaches   the revlon hairdryer has just been purchased but i like it already   it is priced affordably but has many options and handles easily   not disappointed in the least  this dryer is not harsh on my hair    love all the heat speed levels  excellent buy  no more digging in my travel bags with its great new color   i love the color  the grip is great  very easy to navigate my glorious mop of nappy hair  the cord retracts  there is a wide variety of settings for every stge of your hair  wet  damp   great for touch ups  too  i am very pleased with the purchase and the attachments that come with it  great investment  if you are a cosmetologist like me you need a great hair dryer   i have yet to come across a great hair dryer  i have had 5 hair dryers in the last 2 years and they have all turned to junk in about 3 6 months use at my shop   i figured that i would give this dryer a try since it had a 4 year warranty i could return it for a refund if it was the same ole dryer as the rest  br    br   boy was i glad i got this dryer  the drying time is cut in half with this dryer and i do not need to flat iron the hair after drying to smooth the frizz  oh  did i say frizz   sorry  this dryer does not frizz the hair    you do not even need to use any frizz control products with this dryer cause the negative ions that this dryer produces really does close down the cuticle and cause a lot less moisture loss and leaves the hair shiny and silky soft   this dryer is a lot quieter than most dryers   i had a client comment wow   this dryer is really quiet   i did not even say it was any quieter than any other dryer   i have gotten raving comments and have been asked where i got this dryer   all i can say is i got it from amazon  br    br   i really love this dryer luxury or ferrari just does not begin to describe this work of art   i highly recommend this dryer for all the hairstylists  br    br   i give this dryer an  a        is it the best   i don t know but i am really glad to have it   purchased at folica when they had a  40 off special  br    br   i have thick medium length wavy fine hair   wash it 5 6 days a week at the gym   had been using their hot tools dryers   two at a time  one in each hand  quite a spectacle    and then using a flat iron   i was happy with the end result but wanted to reduce the time spent  br    br   researched the dryers to death and then just got fatigued and popped for the sedu as it has tourmaline and ionic  and it has a regular plug   i had some bad luck with those huge gf plugs on my hair iron   the price is insane but since i use this nearly every day         br    br   compared to the hot tools dryer  this does not get hotter  which is a good thing because the hot tools is plenty hot enough to fry your hair   but it does blow more forcefully   the dryer is small and easy to handle   did not find it at all heavy   was able to use the one dryer in one hand and brush in the other   it still got my hair dryer faster than using the two hot tool dryers   and much straighter and much smoother   that was the surprise  and the reason i say i am a skeptic no longer   something about the dryer   the tourmaline  the ions  really does make a difference   because my hair was already straighter by the time it was dry  since i could use the brush  the time spent using the flat iron was significantly reduced  br   i hope that with in addition to reducing the time i have also reduced the trauma to my hair  br    br   i cannot tell if this is worth the big premium over the solia and the supersolano which both look to be very nice dryers   but i am very happy with the sedu  for the price  i am ver happy with this dryer  i was willing to pay up to  100 on a new dryer because my hair was looking so dry  dull and damaged  i used this dryer of a friends and really liked the results so i bought one for myself  for the price  it really can t be beat  my hair is softer  shinier and has much more body than with my old hair dryer  br    br   it takes about the same amount of time as my old traditional dryer and is about the same weight so i didn t notice any change there  this item is great if you have a small bathroom like i do   it hangs on the wall and is convenient  it doesn t have any features and only two speeds may be a drawback for some  but that is really all i need  it has no attachments but i just use my own brush to control my hair as i blow dry  i have a disability so i can only dry hair one handed i searched all over the net for a hands free dryer holder and this one was exactly what i was looking for i stick it up on my mirror after showering  but am planning on attaching it to my wall if they ever get more in stock please put more in stock i need another one to take with me on vacation  i bought this dryer based on reviews  i have had it about 2 months now and every time i use it the handle gets so hot that i actually get 1st degree burns on my palm  i am trashing this and getting a new non revlon dryer  stay away       this is a super dryer   it is very powerful for the small size and low price   it worked just fine in ireland  wales  and england   at home i use it to dry my dogs  br    br   update july 2013  br   my review was not for this proversa dryer  br   i bought a dryer in summer 2011 but it said first class on it   i ve seen first class dryers in hotels so i decided to buy it because it must be dependable  br   i can t review this dryer honestly as amazon has perversed my review of the first class dryer by playing switcheroo with proversa   i call bs  my old faithful conair finally died and this dryer was the replacement   and a dandy one it has turned out to be   it dries very quickly compared to my older model and it is lighter weight and easier to handle   no problems of any kind   good purchase  this small and powerful dryer is perfect for my bathroom   up and out of the way  easy to mount  highly recommend  i used to have a vidal sassoon hair dryer and it last long like 3years or maybe more  i bought this other one  br   their hair dryers are the best so far almost professional  they blow a decent hot air which saves u time  and make ur hair has a style  by the way i have a thick but smooth wavy hair and it s colored which makes it harder to blow  br    i definitely recommend it as the best in the market now and one of the strongest hair dryers  br   i will always buy this brand of hair dryers because now i trust them  i does not have a difuser  but is a very lite and comfortable grip  leaves your hair shinny  like it  i really wanted to love this product  it worked great for about a month  then i noticed it started sparking  initally i thought it was because i left it on the high heat setting everytime i used it  however  the sparks began occuring more often and i could smell it burning  i still gave it benefit of the doubt and figured there was just a faulty piece in the dryer and i happened to be the lucky person who bought it  so i threw it away and bought the same hair dryer thinking this time it would work  it worked great for about two months and then it started throwing out blue sparks again  i have used the dryer at my house   while on vacation out of state and it still sparks regardless of where i plug it in  i hate to bad mouth any product from remington because i am a fan of their other products  but i just don t see how this can just be a coincidence  when i contact remington  i can never get through directly to someone  it s not really worth trying to get them to send me a new one  i have learned my lesson once and for all  use at your own risk  i have curly hair  after being without a blow dryer for a long time i decided to by this one  i love thats its pink and a donation is made for each one sold but it also is the best blow dryer ever  i use the medium setting and my shoulder lenght hair is completely dry in just a few minutes  then i either straighten my hair  with my flat iron or add a little leave in conditioner spray to wear it curly  its easy to use and light weight and doesnt get too hot and fry my hair  i wondered whether it would be worth the money when i purchased this blow dryer a few years ago   however  it didn t take me long to learn how superior this blow dryer is to all of the others i have used   it dries my hair faster than any other blow dryer   i m not sure how  but my hair looks nicer too   it doesn t make that high pitched engine sound like other driers   i like the little red rubber tabs on the side   you put it down and it stays where ever you put it  when i go on a trip and have to use the hotel s driers  i am instantly reminded of how much better the remington is  the only thing that is a little bit of a negative is that it is heavier than other blow dryers   but  it is hardly worth the mention   this drier is well worth the extra money  this hair dryer does exactly what it s meant for  good quality product overall  the only thing i m a little unhappy with is the switch which seems a tad cheap to me  slides a little loose in the 3 positions  but it works fine  i would recommend this to someone  price is right and it s perfect for travel  a month ago i reviewed this product with the title  a piece of crap  see below review    after this review i decided to contact the remington online customer service and sent them a message with my complaint   shortly thereafter i received an email from them asking me to return the broken one and they would send a replacement   they sent the shipping box and the label as well and within 10 days i had a new dryer that i have been using since with no problems   granted it has only been a month but i was very impressed with remington   i just hope that no one there was injured when testing the dryer  lol     it really did blow flames   obviously there was a short which could happen with any electrical product but it was the way that the company responded that i had to give the rating of 4 stars when previously i only give it 1   i really do like this dryer and how my hair looks and feels afterwards which is very different from other dryers that are no ionic   plus it dries my hair super fast without drying it out  br    br   previous review   bought this dryer 4 months ago even though i read the bad reviews as well as the good ones and was concerned but figured it was a good brand name  i only use a hair dryer at most 2x wk  last night i was using the dryer on my wet hair and flames and sparks started shooting out of it    thank god my hair was wet and didn t have any flammable product in it  i showed it to my boyfriend who suggested that i contact consumer affairs for remington  which i just did  since it has been over 30 days i can no longer return the appliance to amazon  i have had many hair dryers and most of the time they have just worn out after a year or 2 but this was just scary  br    br   1 18 13   almost 1 year later    and still working perfectly   in fact  i bought another dryer in the interim  waiting for the new remington and paid a pretty penny for the new one   i used both multiple times  trading off one for the other  i found that i prefer the remington over the other more expensive name brand dryer  the remington does not leave my hair fly away and seems to give it a nice sheen  is that possible    it drys my hair better and more evenly mington over the other more expensive name brand dryer  the remington does not leave my hair fly away and seems to give it a nice sheen  is that possible    it drys my hair better and more evenly  i have very thick and long hair and after having my old dryer for years  the motor was worn out and old  this new dryer is a perfect size  less bulky than my old one  and also very quiet  i don t get ringing in my ears due to the noise  it is not very heavy and does exactly what it is supposed to do  i am very happy with this product  great product for  22  i like the mat plastic touch  feels like a salon model  kind of quiet  and comes with two extra attachments  a bit big for my taste though  i am so glad i found this hair dryer  i was initially looking for one that had the folding handle  but was not successful at the time  this one is smaller than the big bulky types and does the same job  just as good  it s easier to store being more compact and to keep out of the way  even to pack for travel   i ve had it for a year and still like it and it works as good as the day i got it  it s not quiet  but it s not overly noisy either   just sounds like a hair dryer  i really like this blow dryer  it has a very strong motor and gets the job done quickly  the price was just right  i have to be completely honest in saying that  i don t understand why this hairdryer is solely being marketed towards men  it s a nice hairdryer and does the same job like hundreds of other hairdryers on the market  outside of the sporty color that may seem more masculine or the fact that it s inscribed with mangroomer on the side of it doesn t change the functionality of the dryer itself  i would have to say that this is psychological advertising at its best  i am a woman and my favorite color in the whole wide world is red which attracted me to this hairdryer plus i needed a new one so i was very happy to get this one  my husband thinks the dryer is ugly  he has never used a hairdryer on his hair because he wears his hair close to the scalp or completely bald  i will admit that this is one of the best hairdryers that i have ever used  it is more powerful than the hairdryer that i just recently tossed into the trash  it drys my hair quickly unlike my other hairdryer   it is also very sturdy   i have accidentally dropped the hairdryer on several occasions and there is still not one dent  ding or scratch on the mangroomer at all  it is definitely built like a man lol  i think they are calling it a mangroomer since it looks really cool  the grip is nice and feels solid to hold  the hairdryer itself does the job well and dries the hair fast  it has various heat  speed settings  a cool air button  i loved the power on this and it isn t too loud at the same time  you can also use the attachment but for me it worked well without it as well  the red and black combo really looks nice  i do recommend this hairdryer for the price and the power it delivers  this dryer is the dryer of all hair dryers   i have long thick hair  african american  and i have never had a perm   all natural   i have tried different hair dyers and all of the comb attachments would break or come off while i am trying to dry my hair   not only is this product worth every penny  but i love the resin pick  the color of the product and the comb hasn t slid off yet        i plan on buying another one soon and if you have hair that is thick or you are of mixed race  this comb is great   the only con is that the dryer is kind of loud but trust me  you won t care once you put it to your hair  the price is great from this seller and i received the product in a week   very happy  love this blowdryer  it is a bit louder than my chi nano and isn t as powerful but it doesn t seem to effect the drying time  also i would love for it to have a stand but no biggie    this hairdryer is perfect  no more hunting for the hairdryer  it s right there on the wall  just like in a hotel bathroom  i ve only had it for a month but so far i am very pleased  my previous blow dryer was an ionic one and it lasted about 10 years  i don t remember the brand  but it was really expensive and high end  i think it was somewhere around  175 new  so  the other day the heat finally went out on it and i needed to replace it  this time  no question  anything other than an ionic simply won t do  anyways  i found this one and just used it for the first time with a completely wet head and i am so impressed  i can t even believe it   i m not sure if the ion charges on my old dryer had gradually worn out  or if the technology now is just that much better  but i couldn t be happier  it took all of 10 minutes to completely dry and style my hair and it looks amazing  with very little frizz and enhanced the shine too  my other blow dryer had been taking me more like 15 minutes  this remington does have greater watts   power too  but even on the lower setting  my hair was getting dry faster and styling perfectly  i should also mention the design is really neat looking too  it does not feel as heavy  quality  as my other one and the precision  extra  part felt like it was made kind of cheap  but  of course  my other one was about four times more expensive  as long as this one doesn t break anytime soon  i am sure i will be very happy with it   no need for me to add the benefits of the ionic vs the regular blow dryer  you can find that info just about anywhere on the net   i completely recommend this product  good travel dryer  small  light and worked well for our three week trip to italy  only needed the outlet adapter  did not need a heavy converter  still using for travel  when i first came across this product i thought this looked gfeat and i wanted buy it  whwn i received it in the mail  i still thought it looked great but it could definifintely use some improving  the case itself at the top left corner of my phone comes apart sometimes and i havent even dropped my phone    what a huge difference this dryer has made on my hair with only using it one time   my hair has no more frizz   i m so happy     the drier is great  i don t usually review items but this drier is the best one i ve ever used  for the price   23 66   it far exceeded my expectations  although i had never heard of this brand before  i was pleasantly surprised by the quality  it has very easy to use speed and heat settings  the low setting is just right for my fine hair  but still gets hot at that speed  unlike the conair i was using   it s not heavy  the  ion  technology seems to be working   my hair dries much faster  with less frizz  higher shine and so far with less damage to my hair  results from this drier don t even compare to my previous conair 255r  also way better than a bed head drier i bought a few years back  buy this one  the pictures description did not indicate that it can be wall mounted  i mounted it on the wall with screws  i found a wall stud for one screw location  and it is excellent  br   don t mount it vertically  you should mount it  with the slot at a 45 degree angle and not perpendicular  this way  your dryer can be rotated around its vertical axis   so that you can easy adjust to your preference of distance from the wall etc   br    br   it is unfortunate  that this product is currently unavailable  i hope the seller would notice this review and offer more   i know i will be installing this in 3 more of my bath rooms  as soon as they become available  i like the size and sound of this hairdryer   nice and compact on the wall   the first one only lasted 15 months hope this lasts longer   i have had to replace my hairdryer twice and my husband is still using the first one he ordered which is probably 4 5 years old  use on daily basis  this is a 4 star product but i gave it a 3 star as it is a  travel  hair dryer  it should be much smaller than it is even with the cool shot button  like many women  i need all the room i can have in my luggage for other things especially that most hotels   b b s have hair dryers in them  though w o a cool shot button ofcourse   it is not a critical item in travel  it should be much smaller in size with the same quality   cool shot  it s 2012   this shouldn t be difficult technology  very nice hair blowers   easy to attach to bathroom wall   makes it very handy to use and there is no need for a place to store when you are done  i bought this t3 blow dryer over a year ago and just this morning had a failure with it   i have loved this dryer and the technology it uses   i contacted best buy beauty this morning and they are replacing my dryer   great customer service   thank you jennifer cavanagh this product is definitely high powered   it does not get as hot as i would like but the blowing power is almost too much  i have long hair so if i use it on high it does tend to blow so hard it knots my hair   i do like the attachments i use both of them frequently and with the attachments on the blowing power is not enough to tangle my hair so i would recommend using the attachments  or using the dryer on the low setting because it works well   i love the twist on and off lid by the motor because it is easy to clean   the motor does get a funny scent if it is used for a longer period of time but that might be expected because my dryer is only about 2 weeks old   the dryer also isn t very loud so that is another plus   overall it is a good dryer and i feel confident in recommending it  plus the color is amazing it stands out  after having my previous blow dryer for almost 6 years  it finally died on me  i did a bit on research on some blow dryers and to be honest this one caught my eye only because the color lol i read some of the reviews and went ahead and purchased it  it was suppose to arrive on a friday and i recieved it on monday     that was a plus  after usuing it i loved it  it was light weight  small and came with a diffuser and another gadget  i have long thick hair and my hair was dry in less than 15 minutes and it was soft and had less frizz    love this product   i love the look of this hair dryer  so i guess they knew what they were doing when they marketed it to men  i m not a frequent hair dryer user  but it s always good to have one around  this one is manly enough that you ll look cool using it  and can leave it laying around without your date thinking you have a live in girlfriend  br    br   did i just say that  br    br   and yes  i suppose i should mention  it really does dry your hair  now can we go back to talking about how cool it looks  i ve always wanted a compact hair dryer that i could have on the wall   this is one is the perfect one since i don t have a big storage area   it makes my life much more organized and i just love it   it works perfect   i first bought this because the gym i went to had this hair dryer and i always liked how it dried my hair   i also figured people use the hair dryers all day long at the gym so they must last   so when i was in the market for a new hair dryer and decided to buy the same one   ive used this everyday for the past 2 5 years and still works great   the lint catcher is easy to clean out and has good excellent heat and drying power   when this one someday wears out i will be buying the exact same one again  i bought this hair dryer in january of 2010 and it s been just great   however  let me warn you that if it starts to make a low metallic or grinding noise  stop using it   i tried it once more after hearing that and the thing started vibrating wildly and made a terrible noise as if it were about to fly apart in my hand   i unplugged it just in time   maybe you won t have this problem if yours doesn t see much travel  mine was in and out of suitcases so that may have contributed  bought this the other day and was blown away by the power   the attachments fit nice and snug and it dries in less time than my  20 one i had   i definitely recommend this hair dryer   my hair never got frizzy like it does with some other dryers   the hair dryer that i just replaced with this one  the  attachments used to fall off all the time and it was frustrating   i also used to hit the buttons during drying and shut it off accidentally   not with this one   the buttons stay in their position easily  and the attachments stay on and fit really nice   i think this dryer is going to last a long time  like the oster hair dryer a lot   it is larger than my old one  but a lot more powerful   great choice  this is a sturdy  high quality hair dryer   it has all the features that my own hair dryer comes with  it has multiple heat settings  multiple speed settings  a cool blast button  an ionization button you can toggle on and off  and a removable end cap you can use to focus the airflow   it has good speed  nice heat  and durability   it doesn t overheat and it dries hair very quickly  even longer hair like mine   the only thing about this hair dryer that makes it a mangroomer is its appearance   it looks like a power tool  so no man will be embarrassed to hang it in his bathroom where guests might see it   in my home  my teens are using it   it s a great hair dryer  for men or women  this hair dryer works pretty well  it is decent for the price  but not great   still leaves my hair fairly frizzy  regardless of what settings i choose   that said it is not very expensive as far as hair dryers go  so it s probably on par for the price  i was looking for a lightweight  high power hair dryer with lots of features  high low  warm hot  cold shot      and this one surpassed expectations  it is very light and sleek  making it easy to manipulate and switch hands sides of head  it is also very powerful without being overwhelming  it dries my thick head of hair faster than my previous 3 dryers did  i can t think of any criticism  except a curl diffuser attachment would have been nice  i bought this as a gift and it worked out amazingly  she loves the product  you would never guess that you could buy such a quality hair dryer at such a cheap price  takes a few minutes to warm up and the full force setting creates tangles in my hair but i am working with it and getting used to it  the medium setting seems to work well with fine hair  the jury is still out on this product  my experiences with this hairdryer and this company are x4   i purchased two sets of two hair dryers for my daughters for christmas   each set had a travel size and a full size hair dryer   they were  200    for each set   at the time i made this purchase  reviews were pretty good and the warranty for each  hair dryer was for 4 years   within 6 months  both travel size dryers were no longer working   they smelled of burning wires  and were very hot   the company refused to replace them  saying they no longer made this particular model   before the end of the 1st year  one of the regular size dryers had gone bad as well same hot  burning smell   and the other before 15 months was up   comapny wouldn t return a phone call or answer an email   i tried many times for 3 months  finally giving up and calling the seller  qvc    i really didn t expect them to do anything after 15 months    and they didn t   but i wanted to warn them about the company not standing behind the warranty that they used in their sales pitch   they are still selling them  so this warning is for potential buyers from anywhere   don t buy t3 brand products    perfect size  power  and light in weight   best of all great price   i couldnt ask for more br   i use it eveyday  1st i though the power was not enough   but i was wrong this little br   dryer packs a punch     its so i bought another one to share with friend  as a gift  lol br   and the price   you cant even find 1 this low we first encountered this dryer in a hotel room   my wife used it and immediately fell in love with it   small  but it packs a punch  plenty heat and plenty air volume   she simply had to have one since her dryer at home was getting sick   i checked with amazon and found the identical model we had used at the hotel   she loves it and it has performed flawlessly for several months now   we highly recommend this item  i read a lot of negative reviews on this dryer  i love it  it s lighter  weight than the older model and low noise  drys my hair fast without being so hot that it burns my hair   it is quite good in shape and it is convenient to use as it is not so big  the power of it is really nice i bought this dryer to replace my revlon rv544 1875 watt tourmaline ionic lightweight dryer  which started smoking and sparking after less than a year of use  the john frieda is much more powerful  and overall a great product  it is so strong that i can use the low setting on hot heat to get my long hair  mid back length  dry in only a few minutes  5 10   the high setting is very  very powerful  it is relatively lightweight too  it has a nice look   the silver and purple together look sleek  the cord is very long  i would definitely recommend  i contend that a real manly hair dryer would actually shoot fire into your hair to dry it   but  even though this hair dryer does not do that it is still a good product   it has plenty of heat and power  runs fairly quiet and has all the usual features   high and low speed  warm and hot heat  a cool air burst button  and even ionic technology  for what that is worth   etc   and it has an attachment for focusing the drying air  br    br   it is marketed to men but in the end it is still just a hair dryer  red and black and sleek   so really not any less feminine than any other dryer   it does not shoot manly flame or melt women who touch it but if you want to dry   style your hair it should work just fine  i like this product  as someone who regards his hair as stuff that sits on top of my head and needs to be kept in some semblance of tidiness  a grooming product is of little interest to me  i rarely use a hair dryer when i am away from home and it s very much a matter of if it s there i ll use it  if it isn t  then that s what a towel is for  br    br   the mangroomer is a pleasant surprise  the bright red and black design is appealing    clean  bold and well shaped  it looks good and feels good  i liked the solid construction and the firmness of the controls  most of the features go way beyond my needs  i still don t know what all the ionization stuff means  all i want to do is dry my hair quickly and have it feel good  the mangroomer meets my basic needs in this regard  br    br   the slightly higher than average price doesn t seem to me to be excessive and the design makes it worth a few extra dollars  it is definitely more attractive than all the standard bathroom beige and blandness  i did not expect to actually enjoy a hair dryer  summary  function good enough  quality high enough  design a nice extra i did really like this hairdryer   i bought it and it worked well  was not too noisy  had some good power  but after less than a month using it 3 4 times per week for 15 minutes  it just suddenly died and no amount of resuscitation would bring it back to life  fortunately amazon gave me a full refund including shipping   i don t know if it was just a defective one or if it is a common problem with this hair dryer   but that was the end of that  i then went nuts on a  100 00  salon hair dryer and am quite happy now  i also ordered the silver bird 2000w turbo hair dryer at the end of january 2012 but was sent a black bird 2000w hair dryer instead  it was obvious someone stuck the black bird hair dryer in a plastic bag that was sealed with regular scotch tape and had a small label with a bar code and a description for the silver bird dryer   as soon as i received it  i contacted amazon s customer service via an online chat and told them they sent me the wrong item  i was sent a link for a ups return label  which i printed out  i asked the rep if they could arrange for ups to pick the package up since i live in a very rural area  and they were responsible for the fulfillment and shipping of the product  i was told that i would have to find a ups drop off point myself   it was very frustrating dealing with the online chat rep    i tracked the return of the package to amazon and waited for my refund  six business days after they received the hair dryer  i still didn t see a refund to my credit card   this time i checked the box asking for one of amazon s customer service reps to call me  which they did  immediately  this time  my experience with customer service rep  2 was excellent  the gentleman who helped me out was a true pro  he researched my transaction and issued a credit to my account  which hit the next day  i would never order anything from newvo beauty again  fortunately  i received excellent service from amazon s telephone reps  beware of newvo beauty  i don t believe their outstanding ratings  either  i ve never heard of a hair dryer just for men before  but we ignored that part anyway  this hairdryer works just fine for women too  i love the colors  black and red and the accessory attachment works great  i would definitely recommend this hair dryer for men or women  it worked well  looks nice in the bathroom and is a good value  first  i am a woman and i got this hairdryer for my own use  my hubby is bald    the mangroomer 1680xl 6 did a good job drying my long  thick hair  although not any faster than my old dryer   things i like about it   adjustable heat settings and the attachable diffuser   it is bigger and slightly heavier than my old drier  but has a good rubber grip  quiet motor  and a fun bright color scheme  i tried it with the ionic setting on and with it off and found no difference in the look of my hair with either  i did laugh at the target branding to the male population for this mangroomer   i would like have been in the boardroom when that product concept was being reviewed   i guess they felt this was an under served market even though the total available market  tam  for men is probably much smaller than the women s market when considering that a  there are alot more bald men than women  b  alot of men barely comb there hair so they certainly don t blowdry it  and c  the wife s hairdryer is already sitting there if needed   but  if you want a manly hairdryer then i guess this fits the bill   it does have manly color   evokes feelings of a red corvette   it is substantial weight and feels good in the hands   it appears to have extra horsepower to blow hair in a manly fashion and it has lots of speeds to fiddle with   in my usage i actually found it to be a good hairdryer   it does the job blowing my short hair around any which way i chose   but  since my wife has a hairdryer to be honest i don t quite have the bathroom real estate available to store two hairdryers   overall  i give it four stars   a quality product but a bit high on the price value when considering that there are other serviceable hairdryers that cost less   also in terms of necessity factor   for married guys not sure you want a second hairdryer in the bathroom   but if i was a single guy with a red corvette and fabio hair and i had to have a hairdryer in my bathroom then i guess this would be the one  the only reason i can see for this being called a mangroomer is the colors obviously and the shorter cord than say regular hair dryers   i nice strong motor and many settings to please nearly everyone   i would recommend it to a friend  if men talked about such things   lol love this dryer  low setting left hair dry but not static like some dryers  higher settings may be better suited for long hair  nice color combination  my daughter purchased this and because she wanted something cheap and in expensive but with good quality  this was perfect  it came with the concentrator  the one negative thing i have to say is that my daughter would ve liked to have something like the universal finger diffuser  other then that it has really nice settings low med and high with a cooler button and it isn t very heavy  the product works great  i saw some reviews saying it is very noisy  i don t have any concern when i use it  the only thing is it is a little bit heavier than i thought  so hold it for a long time will make my arm a little sour  beside that  it is a very good product with very good price  i will definitely recommend it  i was recommended this blowdryer by a good friend  who was also recommended it by a friend  it dries my hair quickly and leaves it nice and smooth  i had my old dryer for over 4 years  and the change in my hair s texture and the amount of time it took to dry my hair was huge  i would recommend this to anyone  and i really like the look and style of it  this hair dryer is very convenient  small and it has a pretty good power   the item arrived in perfect conditions  this is the second andis 30130 dryer we have purchased   the first one only lasted 6 months  amazons guarantee is for 30 days make sure you send in the warranty if you purchase one of these dryers   liked the dryer is the reason we bought a second one  i purchased   asin b004q6jl04 joico k pak quadraion pro dryer   about 8 months ago  and thought it would be the answer to my needs  well  to be fair it was for about 7 months then it started dying  br    br   so  i purchased this one  i really like it  it is a little louder than the joico one but that doesn t bother me  this one works great  the buttons take a minute to get used to but they aren t a deal breaker  it dries my hair just as fast as the spendy one  makes it shiny  and has multiple heat settings  the cold shot works great as well  br    br   really is a great deal for a quality dryer  i tried the best and had nothing but issues   so i would rate this one the best  br   i can recommend   asin b004q6lvaw joico k pak quadraion blowdry spray  5 1 fl  oz    it works with any dryer    i was so pleased with this dryer  it gave my hair a thicker look  the volumizer works really good  makes my hair even thicker  wish it came with a comb tho  but its good  and i love it    excellent product  it works as advertised and the power is sufficient to straighten even the most curly hair   i recommend the product highly  this is the best blow dryer i have brought it works amazingly on my hair and my daughters hair  i have tried other blowers but they would always leave my hair fizzy and dull  but this blower leaves my hair soft  manageable and frizz free  i have thick hair that is cut into a bob  this is exactly what i was looking for in a dryer  it has high and low settings and it also has 1400 and 1600 adjustable settings  i chose to keep mine on 1400 and it dries my hair in minutes  it is also perfect for styling my hair as i do the final drying  i love the convenience of having it mounted on the wall out of the way  it does have a nice night light that is bright  but i count that as a plus for early morning trips to the bathroom when you aren t ready for a regular light  this hair dryer is the one i m keeping after returning two others to walmart   it has three heat settings  and the hot is actually hot   it s lighter than other dryers too   it s my favorite because it s significantly quieter than the others i tried  i really like this dryer  the fact that it has a retractable cord is a real plus  the heat and speed settings are also great  my t3 just stopped working after 3  months  3 months      i am a professional and can not afford for this to happen while blowdrying a clients hair   this has never  ever  happen to me with any other professional blowdryer     i am taking one more chance on this product since  i have a bad shoulder    it really is light weight   leaves the hair very smooth   shinny      last chance t3     side note  there are plenty of other blowdryers that also can do a great job   i have thick and wavy hair type which frizz easily and takes a long time to blow dry using conventional non ionic hair dryers  when i first started using t3 s pro ionic ceramic hair dryer last year i noticed and felt an immediate difference on my hair  after using it for about two months  i m very happy with the results  my hair became more manageable and is less frizzy  it is soft and smooth  i thought all the touramaline ionic ceramic hair dryers would produce similar results  so i was searching for a less expensive alternative one so that i can have two ionic dryers on hand  i read the positive reviews on this andis hair dryer  then i decided to purchase it  i m thankful the delivery was super fast  after using it a few times  i have to say the result is just mediocre  compare to t3  this andis model loses its shine  my hair feels dry after using it  it doesn t seem to be able to smooth out my hair or create shine and eliminate frizz as well as the t3 does  it works just like a regular hair dryer for me  except because of the ionic in it  it does dry hair faster than non ionic hair dryers  overall  here are the pros   cons in my opinion on this andis 75370 tourmaline ionic ceramic hair dryer  br    br   pros  it has a beautiful black and gold finish on the exterior  a good size for home use  powerful air flow  dries hair fast  3 heat settings 2 air speeds  has the cool shot button  br    br   cons  feels heavy on hand   noisy  heat settings air speeds settings are in odd position  the switches seem to get in the way while holding and using the dryer  the blue ion indicator light is extremely bright  it s very annoying  the overall result in terms of adding silkiness and shine isn t impressive  not sure if the heating material is made with solid ceramic  br    br   the bottom line  this hair dryer is not bad  it does the drying job alright  i just don t think it s great for those with thick wavy   coarse hair type hoping to get smoother and luster result after blow dry  if your hair type is normal   fine  frizz is not the major concern for you  you may be okay and satisfied with this one w dry  if your hair type is normal   fine  frizz is not the major concern for you  you may be okay and satisfied with this one  this is the first thing i bought on line before   after my hairdryer broke and visiting a couple of stores with no success to replace it  i decided to put my amazon prime account to use   the hairdryer arrived on time  the pink was a little different from what i thought it would be  but still nice   the retracting cord is great  no more wrapping the hairdryer cord around the unit  this is what sold me on this unit to begin with  my only problem with the unit is the slide buttons   they are not raised  so it is harder to control the heat settings and also shut on and off   overall i am very happy with the unit  the price was great and the retractable cord overrides any button issues   if you order this  you will be very pleased   another plus  it is not as large as you would think it would be  so it will be great for traveling  you go amazon  having fine hair i find the 1875 watt hair dryers a little too forceful to be able to style my hair while drying it so i was looking for a 1600 watt hoping that it would make a difference and it did  they are hard to find so i was really happy to find this one  it s nice lightweight and even comes with some styling tools i personally couldn t be happier  this is the second one we have ordered  product works great  easy install and very powerful  last one was left on and clipped into the holder  it melted the holder enought so it would not stay in  have had the first one about 4 years with no problems  use almost every day and still works well  keeps the bathroom counter and cabinet free  there is no way to adjust the height of the bonnet   the high setting will burn your scalp and the low setting takes too long  and this is the top of the line    in your description it said it has a cool shot   this was the one thing that i was looking for  and it does not have it   disapointing  unlike some hairdryer s that claim to be quiet and not blast your eardrums   this one is really quiet and has no loud pitch or squeal   lightweight and folds up when you need to travel   great design on the retractable cord  which once you have this you won t be able to ever buy one without this feature  i purchased this item for home use three years ago   yesterday morning after towel drying my hair  i started the dryer and a blade broke off in the turbo fan not unlike a jet engine blowing up   there were no fragments flying around the room  it simply locked up with unmistakable fumes of wire insulation roasting  the power surge button did it s job well by instantly shutting off  br   this little hair dryer was used daily by several people guests and visiting relatives for three years  br   visitors constantly remark  where did you get this wonderful little hair dryer  br   i ordered two more for my home this morning  br   it s not quiet   the thing does scream   it is however  remarkably fast drying hair and the night light works well  product dries hair quickly  although larger and heavier than most folding dryer s the price was good and so far the quality has been good also  this is a great dryer for me because i would have to consciously try to overdry my hair  i have a cheap conair that i keep on hand for when my good dryers break so i can get by until a good one arrives  this is a good one  and what a difference  i m so glad it arrived quickly or my hair would ve been toast  i have thick  fine  fuzzy flyaway hair and with the pik attachment i have had no problems  the only problem was on my end  when the unit arrived  i thought the spongy tape material within the concentrators were for packing purposes so removed it  i had to get some more from a local craft store so do not remove that tape   my bad  br    br   again  i m not a professional but i don t want charbroiled hair either  i m pretty confident that won t happen with either of these products and the other haircare products i use  i m fond of haircare products with argan oil in them for its thermal protection since my stylist tells me my ends aren t bad at all  that s after she reprimands me for not coming in but every 6 to 9 months  br    br   i ordered the   asin b002rc8imq andis elevate nano diamond ceramic digital flat iron   to go with it and was not so happy  so see that review to understand why  br    br   i even used the elevate on my dog today without issue  of course it helps that i used to groom dogs so know better than to leave it in one spot for too long which can endanger a pet by burning him her  br    br   addendum 03 15 2012 br   i ve noticed a few people complain about the design of the dryer with regard to the on off switch and utilizing the pik attachment  it takes some getting used to in order to hold the dryer and feed your hair through the pik  i had a difficult time at first as well  i can t describe the way i do it  i m not even sure i m doing it correctly   i can only say that once i got used to it  it was easy to use the pik and not shut the dryer off  this is a good hair dryer in a fun color   the best feature of this hair dryer is the cool shot feature  which blows cool air for just a moment   this is nice if you are starting to overheat from all of the hot air   and the best part is that it actually gets more powerful rather than less powerful when using the cool shot feature   the only negative is that this hair dryer is a bit big and bulky  but this is not a major problem   overall  i like and recommend this hair dryer  this hair dryer has a lower noise level when in use   many dryers have a very high pitch whine from the fan motor   fan was found as the dryer provided in a hampton inn  two other hair dryers died in one week   this came quickly  and in good condition   i seems to do a good job  and to offer options for heat and power   i d purchase from the vendor again  excellent for thick long hair   it just take me 15 min to dryhair   my hair now shiny and looks more stylist pros  lots of nice features  fold up handle and retracting cord  really does make my hair feel soft and seem healthier  br    br   cons  it s not as lightweight as i would have hoped or some other reviews have said  it s also not as quiet as other reviews have stated  the noise is average  not any quieter or louder than others that i have owned  br    br   overall  i am happy with it  especially for the  25 00 price  br    br   update 04 16 13   owned for over a year and still going strong  got this for a relative for xmas  she is very pleased with it  it has 3 fan speeds  which is not that easy to find any more  it comes with a couple of drying accessories  too  it is not lightweight though  which  in my view is the only shortcoming  despite trying many hair conditioners and smoothers  my hair remained dry and frizzy   finally  someone advised me it might be my hairdryer   i needed the concentrator attachment   i checked amazon s reviews  and noted that this dryer did not work well on thick or long hair   so  it seemed perfect for my short  thin hair   and i am satisfied   even at the same 1875 watts as my old conair dryer  this one does not seem to get very hot and it does take longer to dry my hair  about 10 15 minutes longer   i ve had two ion dryers that claim to dry hair faster  and i don t believe it    but  i am better able to style my hair while i dry it  and am pleased with the results   my hair looks shiny and has almost no frizz  even in the dry air of a heated house  works fantastic and came with a diffuser and another nozzle for straigtening  very inexpensive and works great   i bought one for myself and one for my mother  this hair dryer is pretty good for the price   it has alot of options as far as speed and heat  plus has the turbo option and a cool shot   it doesn t dry my hair faster unless i use the turbo option  even then it s not a big difference   i still like the hair dryer though  it s easy to handle and does it s job  i m just a guy and my needs for a good hairdryer are the following  br   good airflow br   quiet br   drys the hair quickly br   this hair dryer meets all three  plus the price is right  it s a great little hair dryer  small footprint on wall   dries hair efficiently  what more could you ask for  this unit is quieter than others i have  and dries my hair faster  seems to have good power  i also find it comfortable to hold and the switches work smoothly  this is my first non  12 drugstore hairdryer and i think i m satisfied   the difference isn t as miraculous as i was hoping it would be but it s still a very good hairdryer   when i used it with no attachments it blew my hair into oblivion but dried my very thick hair in record time   not a hairdo i could leave the house with though   but when i used the curly hair attachment  the one with the prongs  it worked perfectly  albeit taking longer to dry    my only complaint is that the buttons are placed right where my hand holds the dryer which means that until i got used to adjusting my grip  i would constantly be turning it off or changing the settings inadvertently   i don t really like the way that i have to gingerly hold the thing to avoid this   overall  if you re looking to upgrade to a grown up hair dryer  this one is a good one    first of all  it came in it s original packaging  but it looked like it had been opened before   multiple times  i was sceptical  but i plugged it in and tried it out  it was a little heavy  but worked nicely  though i didn t like that you can t change  compact  sleek and the best part is   the dual voltage that makes this the best travel companion i could ask for   did i mention that it works so well  that it takes me half the time it used to with my old dryer  a must buy  i m planning to buy a couple more as gifts  this is a hair dryer with lots of heat and power  to get you ready and on your way fast  it is comfortable to hold  and works well at every setting  love the fiery red color too  it gives a bit of energy to the morning  i bought this hairdryer because my last conair had finally conked out after about 15 years   i took it out of the box to test it  plugged it in  turned it on and almost immediately decided to return it   i liked to use the hot setting on my old dryer  so i kicked the temperature setting up to hot on this one and was stunned to find that the warm setting is actually hotter than the hot setting   the hot setting was barely warmer than the cool setting   something is seriously wrong with that   also  the cord was very difficult to retract   i can understand why so many people say that the cord keeper function stopped working after a very short time   this convinced me that even though a retracting cord may be convenient  it is more trouble than it is worth  i have received this product today and used it  this blower makes my hair more manageable  and dried it faster too  i have a thick hair  and although my old blower is not really old  3 4 years old  but it makes my hair  frizzy after i use it  after reading the reviews  i said that i will give it a try  and i am happy that i did  i like this product and i recommended it    p s  i also read in some of the reviews that they died after several months so for now i am giving it 5 stars and i will update my review if it breaks since i just used it once  i bought the andis 1600 hair dryer as an alternative to the conair 1600   the conair 1600 is now impossible to find anywhere  but i don t like the more up to date 1875 watt conairs as they blow either too hot or too cool   the andis has four settings instead of two or three on conair dryers  which provides good heat control   it s very robust and not too heavy  br   what i didn t know when i originally wrote this review was that the first one would only last 8 months   however  a replacement dryer i received under warranty is still going a year and a half later  so maybe i was unlucky the first time around  it dries my hair quickly  is small enough to pack in my suitcase  has a retractable cord  and makes my hair incredibly silky and smooth  and you can t beat the price either  i m never buying another dryer brand model as long as this one is in production  high watts  nice attachments and when i purchased it was a little higher  but still worth the price   i still use it to this day  the cheery brightens the day too  i first used this blowdryer at a hotel and liked it so much i looked for it online  i was pleasantly surprised to find it so affordable  this blowdryer is light and dries my hair very fast  it cut my drying time by more than half compared with my former professional grade more expensive blowdryer  i timed it and dried my fine  wavy chin length hair straight in 4 minutes  i also used the vidal sassoon vs7963 ionic thermal all purpose brush   the retractable cord prevents cord tangles and extra cord weight  this blowdryer is easy to use and a great value for the price  br    br   update  11 25 12 br   almost a year later  the blowdryer still works very well  nothing broke and i enjoyed it all year  today i took off one star  however  because the dryer doesn t come with enough options  no styling nozzle or difuser  the settings are also very basic  so i did buy a new blowdryer  from a different brand  for not much more money than ths one  in order to have more options such as two styling nozzles and options for 3 temperatures at different  blowing speeds  still  i believe i got my money s worth with this very decent andis  love it  love it   i really like how this dryer works on my hair   it does not br   leave it dry or fly away  but nice  shiny and lively  i bought this hair dryer for a xmas present and in amazon everybody said something good about this hair dryer  that was enought for my to buy it  and she love it but she said takes time to dryer the hair  so i thought double fan must to be enought but not   is kind of weird because is a remington one of the best   but is fine  so what do you think  i love this hair dryer  decided to get a replacement hair dryer because my other one was dying and it took me forever to dry my hair   this hair dryer is not only great quality but it actually dries my hair in half the time   it looks good and very easy to use   the motor in the dryer is not loud and annoying like some hair dryers  my only complaint is that i keep pressing the button while drying my hair  but i think once i get used to holding the dryer from the bottom  it will be fine   if you want a good hair dryer for a great price  this is it  it was powerful as advertised and according to reviewers   i realize the faster the fan  the more it dilutes the heat from the heating coils  but it could be a little warmer   i d still recommend it though  bought this for my girlfriend over a year ago and it s still working  br    br   the very nice soft touch coating has started to peel away pretty significantly though  but for  25 i guess i can t complain too much  my wife has been wanting one of these after our first motel several years  now we have one of the best hair dryers we have ever had works great arrived earlier than told  i love my t3 micro featherweight luxe hair dryer   i had used my friends sultra hair dryer and loved it    so i started to research investing in a quality hair dryer myself and decided on the t3   i can t believe how much faster my hair dries with it and my hair is so much silkier now   truly frizz free   it is very light weight and easy to use   i actually took the time to plug in my old conair hair dryer and compare to my new t3  and it felt like someone was just blowing on my head to dry it lol   it really made me value my new dryer   my hair is straighter and easier to maintain with out all the old ways i used to use to style  the hairdryer is only okay  i will say that the cord is very sturdy  which was a concern from other reviewers  my previous hairdryer was the chi turbo professional  and it lasted about 5 years  i don t like this hairdryer as much as my chi  and i ve had it long enough  3 months  to get used to it  it isn t super quiet like some reviews said  and it doesn t dry my hair any faster than my chi  also  the front of the nose  before the black attachment  gets very hot and you can t hold it  i like to hold my hairdryers at the nose when i am drying the front of my hair  but now i can t  i ll definitely keep this hairdryer until it s time to get a new one  but it didn t impress me  it still gets 3 stars because it isn t a bad hairdryer  but also it s nothing special  this hair dryer started out great and i loved the added night light feature   it did not last long at all so now i m shopping for something to replace it   my poor wall  this will be the third dryer   i am beginning to wonder if there is a wallmount dryer that lasts more than a year  i bought this dryer 2 months ago  and even with light use  it has now quit working  don t buy this   it s junk  i ve only used this dryer a couple of times but it is great so far  it is actually much nicer looking than in the picture  it is quieter than my last dryer  it dries my hair a bit faster than my old dryer  and as for the temperature hot is hot warm is warm and the cool is truly cool  the only downside is the cord is like 2 too short when i am trying to blow dry my daughters hair  but i guess that is more of a personal problem ha ha ha  i would recommend this dryer  the product was exactly what we expected  excellent   the arrangement for receiving the product was much more difficult as amazon com would not ship this product  only available in the us  to canada  i have been using the much more expensive tan towels brand for several weeks  but i decided to give these ones a whirl   the tan towels were just getting to be very pricey   i found that these ones work just as well as the others  however  it seems like it takes a few more applications with the loreal brand to get the same color as tan towels  but for this price that hardly matters   some may even think this is a positive  because it allows you more control over your tan   i used these every night for 3 days and i have a wonderful natural looking glow   not too dark at all and not overly noticable   these are great for us fair skinned folks that only need a bit of color   i m not sure you can call this a deep dark tan  but that wasn t what i was looking for anyway  these take a bit of practice to use  since you can t see where it is going on   but after becoming an expert with the tan towels  these were easy  always use a circular motion  also  i found that putting a little bit of lotion on my writs after application really helps with the steaking on my wrists  this was a problem area for me   and  i wash my hands immediately afterward and use the much lighter jergens natural glow lotion on my hands instead  this also helps with the streaking factor  i have long  mid back length  color treated hair   i take really good care of it and only use salon products  use heat protectant etc   i get my hair trimmed regularly  but my ends just felt really dry and my hair was so unmanageable   my old blowdryer was a bedhead one and it made my hair so hot i couldn t even touch it   i decided to invest in the chi rocket after reading the great reviews  i honestly can t believe what a huge difference it s made in my hair   it s amazingly soft and smooth   i really don t even need to do anything else to it after blowdrying  but i use a big curling iron and it looks fantastic   i wish i would have bought this years ago   i will never go back to a cheap blowdryer again  i love tsi la  their scents are great and all natural without making you smell like an incense shop  i ve tried other natural scents that are overpowering or as my non crunchy sister would say it smells ethnic in here when i walk into a room  moving on  all the tsi la scents i ve tried are great  i dont use perfume every day  but i keep this little rollerball in my purse cosmetic bag in case i go to an afterwork event or to freshen up if i m on the go all day before meeting someone out  i m no scent expert  but to me fiori d arancio smells like  delicate fruit loops  ok that sounds totally wacky but its a sweet  clean fruity smell  and smells natural  you can tell there arent chemicals in the scent unlike gross body splashes and stuff  its really hard to find a way to smell these before purchasing too   occasionally you can find sample vials on an auction or deal site  and they are expensive  so the mini is a great way to test it out in an affordable way before upgrading to a full size  if the fruit loop smell is not for you  pass it on to a teenage girl you love  personally i love it  sometimes i mix it with my lavanilla rollerball for a delicious fruity vanilla scent  if you are concerned that perfume has toxic  hormone distrupting stuff in it  you owe it to yourself to try tsi la  however  i would have prefered a more diverse group of piks   i bought my husband a waterpik for christmas  which he loved    i wanted to get a set for myself  but this one only has 3 types  none really as cool as his  and dups of all three    it s a good beginner set i guess    but i will be searching for some of the better ones that came with his  i can t complain about quality   look closely at the piks   if you want two of each of the basics   this is pefect for you  the product works as stated and much along the lines of other positive reviews  i have been using the product for about 3 months now and this is the first shower mirror that has been truly fogless  filling the container with hot water is no hassle and it works great every time  i love all things fresh    but this bath soak is truly the best  the scent is absolutely luxurious  filling your entire bath bedroom with soothing aromatics  i don t get many uses out of it because my large bathtub requires i use a lot  but it is an absolute treat when i do  i even save the bottles as a keepsake  no need to visit the spa as long as fresh keeps making sake  love  love  love it  i know this product has been discontinued so when i found it here i was really excited   i used this alot and really like the way it works   this bottle smelled a bit differently that my bottle i originally used from the store   and didn t work quite as well   but i still use it and it is better than some of the alternatives i have tried  this is a great curling wand  gives great curls that last for days and doesnt frizz out  i was worried that i would burn my self since there s no heat control but i got used to it pretty quickly without the need of the glove   wish personally i dont think would have helped much anyway  overall  a great buy   love the color  also  a very nice surprise was the fact that it indeed does have a swivel cord  even though the description says it doesnt  great value purchased 2 large bottles for the price of one small bottle   my husband loves this cologne and now my son does to  i ve been tanning off   on for a looong time now  i stopped for awhile then got back into it just recently over this past summer  i started with australian golds cheeky brown which was alright for starters  then moved on up to australian golds wicked  stuck with that one for about 2 months but was longing to get more out of my tanning session  so i read the mixed reviews about bombshell here  some people loved it some didn t  shrugs   now me personally  i love tingling lotions  and not only did this one have a kewl name and 100xx  which was waay more then i d ever used  but it has a foxy lil 1950s pin up girl on the label   d so i ordered it  it arrived rather quick  it only tingled  like  3 times when first using it   the smell is awesome  i didn t feel like i needed to run home and take a shower after applying it  all in all  if you like that tingle factor  and are looking to get a better more dark color  i totally recommend this lotion      this improved my skin tone and texture so much   i have had troubled skin since i was a teenager and this makes me feel better about the appearance of my skin   i use it every morning and night and i saw a difference within a couple days of use   the brush is really easy to change and i love the magnetic charger  these paints are colorful and really easy to use  they come with the option to paint like normal finger nail polishes or you can flip them over and use the paint pen  the pen option works well for doing designs and nail art  i would buy some clear polish to help protect the designs though  the product is cute and worth the money  this blush palette lasts forever because even the smallest amount is still enough  many to choose from to go with different makeup looks   some of them are kind of orangy tho  i stick with the bronzes and pinks the celtrixa cream really does work  i am not sure how severe or what kind of results people are expecting  i noticed the stretch cream work very fast on my stretch marks  everything takes time and i ve tried other creams and never seen results as quick as i have seen on this one  i wish this was in a quick dry formula  but it s amazing as is   from no base coat to using this  i can add 5 days onto my manicure   2 3 extra days from a sally hansen base coat  which i consider quite good as well  br    br   obviously the opi pro brush is awesome for most of us  but not so awesome for those of you who have smaller nails and problems with thick brushes  this was a gift  the receiver of the was most pleased  i enjoyed shopping on amazon  they make it very easy to purchase as many items as you wish  i like the pigment in this colour   i like bascially all of the nyx colours  and they have a large variety to choose from  i searched and researched for a new hairdryer to replace my sad  old  held together with tape dryer  and based on reviews  put this one on my wish list   finally  on christmas  it was mine   i love this dryer so much   it dries my hair so much faster than any other dryer   even some pricier ones i ve used in the past   the best part is that it doesn t leave me a sweaty mess when i m done   i don t know if it s just the air speed  or the well designed air flow and concentrator  but even though it can blast some hot air  i actually have to back it down to medium heat when i have the concentrator on   i am not dripping in sweat when i m done blowing it straight section by section with my round brush   this makes me so happy   i can wash and dry my hair and be ready for makeup in so much less time than i ve ever been able   it s no louder than average   it s no heavier than average   but it works so much better than average   i love how you press the cool shot button and it stays cool  then push it again and it goes back to hot   no more holding it down awkwardly   i have accidentally pressed it a time or two  but so easy to press it back and move my hand down a smidge    my hair is very fine and a bit wavy  and i have a lot of it  so i really need a dryer that can get in there and start drying out the hair  especially in the back and at the crown  before i start sleeking it down with the concentrator  and this dryer can do it in minutes without me sitting around air drying it for 20 30 minutes first     happy customer here   highly recommend this product  i got this dryer to replace my old one and wow does it make a difference   my hair is so soft and shiny  i can even use this to dry my 1 year old daughter s hair and i couldn t to that with my old one because it would get too hot even on the lower setting  it dries fast without burning   definitely worth every cent  this is a great hair dryer  it really does seem like i have more volume  i got mine on sale otherwise i don t if the price is great if you re tight on money but i would buy it again for sure  this is the best blow dryer i have ever owned  i am african american with coarse natural hair  this blow dryer gets my hair dry very quickly with minimal hair loss  the design is lightweight and easy to hold plus the attachments are perfect  i find the goldish color to be kinda nice in my opinion as well  the price is competitive and it is lasting me a while  andis might be highly underrated like a best kept secret  most people wouldn t expect something with such a low price to work so greatly  i love this and recommend it to everyone  conair 2000 watt hair dryer is perfect  transaction was smooth and quick  excellent deal  durable product powerful and easy to use  surprised when it arrived early next morning  i ve used another popular brand of hair dryer for years  but i recently purchased a remington straightener  and i then decided to update my years old hair dryer  after doing lots of research  i found that this was the most popular remington hair dryer and had great reviews  i have used it a couple of times since receiving it  and i like it  i think i prefer my previous hair dryer more  as the hair seemed softer  but this one does just fine  and actually dries my hair faster than my older one  i was looking for ionic  and this has that as well  buy this hair dryer on amazon  i found it was the cheapest price  try it out for yourself  good product  this the second one we have owned  highly recommend this hair dryer  it is like the one s used in hotels  the first we owned lasted 12 years of everyday use  installed this for my wife  to try to keep the counter uncluttered  good quality product very easy to mount  easy to use  would like the cord about 1ft longer  but love it anyway  especially like the way it shuts off when you push it back in its holder  and it has a magnetic clasp to hold it    very happy well  i haven t used the product yet  but it s small size is perfect for packing  i ll try to remember to leave additional feedback on its use  love this dryer   first saw at hotel in san diego   i had to have it   amazon had it the cheapest on the internet  i would recommend this product  i redid my bath  hung this on the medicine chest  love the night light  great performace  the best blower ever   max i bought this hair dryer as a gift for my girlfriend   she really seems to like it   i can attest that it blows hard and hot      is there anything else you need from a hairdryer   oh yeah  it has widely adjustable temperature and speed    i have never really bought anything online and this is the first review i ve ever written  that said  i m extremely happy with this purchase  i didn t know a hair dryer could  style  my hair  this product is much more powerful than my previous  15 drugstore purchase  that feature helps tame cowlicks  overall  i have no complaints  i am very happy   there are plenty of reviews here on the performance of this dryer  which i think is fine  but i wanted to comment on it being a quiet dryer   it is quieter than most  but my previous conair ionic hair dryer was 80 decibels on high  and this one is 90 decibels on high   anything over 80 decibels can damage your hearing  so i m a bit disappointed in this  but again  it s still quieter than most hair dryers    but i would have thought the newer dryer would have been even more quiet  i was really suprised with the poor quality of this hair dryer   over the past many years  i have used the conair brand   after just a few uses  the retractable cord stopped retracting and the cool air button no longer popped back up  so i all i was able to do was dry my hair with cool air   once i folded it up  a plastic part in the dryer broke and a spring fell out as well   i purchased a cheaper non folding  non retractable cord dryer and it works better than this more expensive model   save your cash and do not buy this  this is a nice basic hair dryer and very affordable   no frills  no thrills  doesn t fold  no retractable cord  etc   works very well and nothing has broken so far   far better than the more expensive model   so far  i m very pleased with my purchase  item arrived promptly and so far it works as promised  dries as quickly as can be expected for the price we paid  a review from my mother in law  br    br    my hair is thinning and this dryer gives me volume   with my head upside down while blow drying  in just a couple of minutes  i have full  shiny and manageable hair   the user friendly design is  great too   the heat and speed settings are at a comfortable spot on the handle and unlike my last dryer  they stay where i set them  br   definitely a good purchase this is a great hair dryer   drys my hair quickly without getting overly hot   i like the placement of the switches so you can just use your thumb to adjust the heat and flow while you are drying and styling  i am quite dissapointed in this hair dryer    its making a loud noise    i have only used it 3 times  its also cumbersome   heavy   too large    the warm setting is far too hot    its like hot   i am not a happy customer    i ve had this dryer for over 1 1 2 years now and i love it  my hairdresser convinced me to get a new dryer so i picked her brain for what features to look for  when my daughter said she wanted a new dryer i pulled out the list of features my hairdresser gave me and that made me think to share it here    1  concentrator  that s the main thing my old one lacked and why it was worth buying a new one   just for that  i have shorter hair and use a curved brush to style in shape  the concentrator focuses the heat on the curve i m styling and it does make a big difference  the dryer also comes with a diffuser but that s for completely different hair than i have   2  power   my stylist gave me a number of watts and i don t remember the number but this unit exceeds it  this is something to be careful of anyway  we had an electrician looking at a problem with blowing the bathroom circuit and he said it s common for new hairdryers to blow the circuits on old houses because new ones are so much more powerful  that turned out not to be our circuit problem but thought i d mention that there are practical limits to high power that are a pain to cross  this dryer puts out all the heat my scalp can take   3  cleanable vent  the back grille should be easy to open   clean out lint  major impact on strength of the fan   on life span of the appliance if you keep the lint out   4  3 heat settings  5  3 fan settings  this unit is actually a compromise with only two fan speeds   off but i always use high anyway  cause  i m impatient   6  swivel cord vs  retractable cord   my hairdresser said she looks for a swivel cord but it was pretty well impossible to find in less expensive models even in beauty supply stores  realize pros pay over  100 for professional hairdryers  i looked high and low for this feature  it probably extended my search for a new hairdryer by almost a full year  i finally gave up on it when i set my sights on a retractable cord  the retractable feature also seems to keepthe cord tangle free  my curling iron has a swivel cord but it gets more tangled because it gets all scrunched up in the drawer  my biggest concern was that the retractable cord would give out but it s still going strong after 1 1 2 years  i love this feature as it keeps my dryer neatly tucked away in its drawer    7  cold shot   my hairdresser didn t include this feature because she doesn t use it  but i wouldn t buy a dryer without it  this is a button that  when pushed in  makes the dryer switch to unheated air which sets a curl curve much  much better  it takes a little more time to style the hair  which is why hairdressers often don t use it  but my style lasts days longer  easy feature to find but it s not universal so if you want it you need to check for it and this dryer does have it  it s the blue button on the top of the handle   bottom line  i love this dryer  if it s been a while since you bought a new one  go for it  you ll be amazed at what a time saver it is  at this price from amazon  it s a great value  in my area target   walmart sell this dryer for  5 more plus tax   i d buy it again in a heart beat  we bought one of these two years ago  for our remodeled bathroom   worked perfectly  so when we moved into our new house in 2011  we bought another one   again  works perfectly  very convenient  very well built    two criticisms    the night light is too bright   a dimmer on the side would be much preferred   and  the wall anchors that come with it really suck   you ll need to buy a set of anchors to mount it correctly     that said  we re buying another for our second bathroom   it s a great unit  i have long hair and i m always in a hurry so when i saw this has twin fans  i bought it   it really does the drying fast   it s not too loud   the sound doesn t bother me like some dryers do   it is a bit heavy but other than that  i m very happy with it  i ve used so many different hair dryers  and i ve always focused on those that dry quickly and delivers much air flow so my hair doesn t feel burned  if it s quiet  it s a big bonus  br    br   my favorite is this  http   www amazon com sharper image ionic conditioning si745 dp b00007m1u2 ref cm cr pr pb t   the sharper image ionic hair dryer  i like the travel version because it s light weight  yet delivers just as much power and air  too bad this is no longer in production  br    br   i also enjoyed this  http   www amazon com healthy infusions wahl pro dryer dp b001e6g6fc ref cm cr pr product top   and i use it as my alternative hair dryer when i can t access my sharper image dryer  this one  too  delivers great air flow at an appropriate temperature and dries my hair quickly and gently  br    br   now  to our product at hand    it s heavy compares to the two i had just mentioned  it s not any more quiet  i don t generally use the air diffuser on my wahl  but i do use it on my sharper image  i tried using the diffuser with this remington  but whether i use it or not  my hair gets very tangled afterward  which isn t a problem with neither of the two i had mentioned  it also does not dry quickly as the title implies  nor does it make my hair feel anymore healthy than before i use it  in fact  rather than taking half the time to dry my hair  i think it doubles the time  br    br   my hair is past the middle of my back  so it s a bit long  maybe this is a great dryer for shorter hair  i don t know  i can t recommend this to others  on the bright side  i get a nice work out with my right arm using it    haha    br    br   two stars  because it works  bought this for my mom for christmas  let me tell yah it was a real chore for a man to choose a blow dryer online for a woman  but the price and weight of this item was good  i especially liked that it has a 4 year warranty  i placed this on my wishlist and it was purchased for me for christmas   i love the color and the cord keeper  however it is very very loud on any setting  nice hair dryer  way more powerful than my old dryer   makes my hair a bit tangled  though  when i don t dry it right away before my mousse begins to dry and set   still a nice dryer for the price  i really love this little dryer   it is very professional looking and as others have mentioned it is feels soft and velvety to the touch  it dries my hair quickly and is not too loud  all things considered   i would say for smoothing it is not a miracle worker  but it does much better than your cheapie dryers  and can help an amateur like me control the frizz somewhat   i think super smoothing requires more proper technique than just a magic hair dryer   unfortunately i am not well versed in that technique  but with this dryer my hair doesn t look too frazzled and out of control   my only issue with this dryer is that i have very long hair and sometimes when i am using it the hair gets sucked into the fan on the back end of the dryer   i think this is because this dryer is smaller than my last dryer so i need to adjust for this better  overall though  its the best quality for the price i have had in a dryer  i ve owned 3 of these hair dryers now  they would break after a year or so  but given the low price and quality while it worked  i had no problem replacing it  this newer version is not as impressive  the eco options are great for the environment  but it takes twice as long to dry my hair  the heat is no where near even the middle option on previous versions  might be great for those who don t need a quick dry and like the lower temperatures  but it was not what i am looking for  it was a great deal  it s worth the price  my wife loves it  it is powerful  and until now is not heating in excess  even when a small problem arose  customer service was so accommodating  very nice dryer  excellent customer service and very prompt responses  i bought this after my chi broke and i read the amazon reviews that recommended this dryer as very reliable   yes  it is reliable and it works well but i really prefer the ionic dryers as opposed to the high pressure for drying hair   it dries quickly  like ionic but does not leave my hair and smooth  soft and shiny as the chi  did i mention that it broke after 6 months       so  i am keeping this for awhile but next time i get a gift card or am feeling like i want to treat myself  i might get an ionic dryer and give this one to my sister  baby  it s super fast  yes it is     i used to use the blow driers with the brush attachments  because otherwise my hair would frizz up  well  they stopped making them so i stopped blowing my hair dry  for years   last week i used the remington d3710 fast finish turbo hair dryer because i had a party to go to and i fell in love with it and its magical defuser attachment  not only does my hair dry before ten minutes pass  it comes out straight as a poker when i use the defuser  it s not too heavy and it s even snazzy looking  just seeing it cheers me up   prince might prefer purple  but i love my little red corvette blow dryer    i had an andis wall mounted hairdryer previously and  after three years of almost daily use  it died   wanted a replacement and felt this brand was reliable and reasonably priced   this model isn t as powerful as my other one  however  it s fine for my use   i have very short hair   i read some of the complaints regarding difficulty mounting the unit   make your life easy   use two sided tape rather than drilling holes into your cabinet   this way you won t damage the cabinet if when you remove it   yes  the nightlight is bright but if you find it objectionable  just pull out the plug when not in use   i would definitely recommend this product  great product not as loud as other hair dryers  although it is a bit heavier because of the material its made of   im happy with it  i just hope it last longer than other remington products  i was so tired of wimpy hairdryers that i had to buy this hairdryer after reading the other reviews   the reviews are correct   the air that comes out of this dryer is incredible    it dries my hair quickly  but the nice thing is that it dries your hair with air and not by baking it with intense heat   it is hot  but not scorching   a great purchase  this hair dryer is made with quality  it is not heavy  not noisy  hot and offered at a good price  amazon did a great job wtih sending me an expedited replacement order at no cost to me when my original order was lost in delivery  this hair dryer is very stylish  i love the aesthetics of it and it has this super long cord so i can move around and do my make up at the same time without pulling the cord out    love the adjustable heat and speed selections  the highest setting is too hot though and burnt my scalp a bit  the dryer is also a bit heavy so makes my arms a bit tired but besides that  no complaints  i spent a lot of time researching which hair dryer i wanted to purchase and i decided the conair infiniti cord reel was exactly what i was looking for  i always go to amazon first when making a purchase so naturally i checked to see if it was available  it was in stock  listed for a great price and also included free super saver shipping i placed my order right away  when i got home from work today the amazon box was waiting for me   woo hoo  my new hair dryer    i opened the box and instantly knew that what i was seeing was not what i had ordered  it was made by conair  was the same color  had the same attachments and had the same model number on the bottom of the box but it was called the conair you reel  see the picture i posted above   i called conair to find out if they had changed the name and packaging of this hair dryer  i was told by the conair customer service department that you reel is a subsidiary of conair and although it is covered by the same warranty as the infinti it is not the infiniti  i called amazon customer service and as always they were very friendly and offered to either send me another hair dryer or refund my money  since i haven t even plugged the hair dyrer in yet i wanted to try it before deciding to return refund it  i have had several conair hair dryers through the years and i m sure this one will be just fine  i will update this review after i use it a few times   i ve never had any problem when ordering from amazon and will continue to do so but i just wanted to warn other people looking at this hair dryer that in this case what you see is not what you get  for years  literally  i d been searching for a powerful hair dryer  one that didn t cost an arm and a leg  this is it  my hair is thin and wimpy  but still takes several minutes to dry  the longer it takes to dry  the frizzier it gets   i m not a pro when it comes to drying my hair  far from it   even if the humidity is high  with this dryer my hair dries fast  frizz free and straight      it is heavy for my arthritic hands and arms  so i use a hair dryer stand  similar to        that i purchased many years ago at a drug store in their made for tv section  i haven t timed it  but it seems to take less than five minutes to completely dry my hair      the cord is approximately six feet long  long enough for my use since i don t walk around while drying my hair  the temperature and air control on the handle are slide levers  with arthritis  particularly bad in my thumbs  i find it somewhat difficult to adjust them  thus the four star rating      color wise  i d describe it as a rich salmon  i don t see a purpose to the clear encasement over the dual fans  but that doesn t bother me one way or the other      over all  i m very glad i made this purchase and i do recommend it for people who don t like spending a lot of time under the dryer  i was really impressed with this blow dryer   i have very long thick hair and it has always taken me at least ten minutes to dry it   this got it dry in 5 minutes   there is a lot of power to it  and i like the fact that it does not get so hot that you can get it close to your scalp   i also love the attatchments   this is a great buy and worth every cent of the money  it is a very pretty color too  i am so entirely pleased with this hair dryer that i m coming back for another one    2 1 2 years later  i ve burned through cheaper  store bought hair dryers in the past  i bought an andis many years ago and it was wonderful  so i bought this model in june 2009  and sadly today in december 2011 it finally fizzled out  br    br   the dryer works extremely quickly  i remember comparing it to the past model i had  and the reason i ve stuck with andis since because of their efficiency  and longevity   i have naturally loose curly hair  and i use this dryer daily to straighten my hair with a round brush  it allows my hair to retain a lot of body  come out super soft  and avoid frizz  br    br   while the switches on the handle are kind of in a bad place  i eventually got used to it and rarely do i accidentally turn it off  it s not hard to turn back on  so i don t see it as that big of an issue  br    br   i ve had great customer service experience with andis in the past as well  the plastic piece that holds the filter on the back of the dryer  at the air intake  broke and no longer functioned  i also broke one of the attachments  i called their customer service number and they replaced both items free of charge  even though i d had the dryer for more than a year  this is a great hairdryer   since i have relatively short hair  i use this product primarily for my daughter  6 years old    she like many other children is picky about who dries her hair  and how her hair is dried   she is blessed with hair that when blow dried looks beautiful  but unfortunately the process requires working through the many knots she routinely achieves in her hair   i ve found that this hair dryer dries her hair faster than hair dryers that i have used previously   its a great hair dryer  its dual action fans give out more air  thus drying hair faster than ever before   this has been a great addition to my routine because it helps accomplish the task a lot quicker than with other hair dryers   the hair dryer has several settings  and when on the high setting i can dry hair in less than 5 minutes  which is fantastic for me   i ve been pleasantly surprised by this hairdryer  as the name implies  this hair dryer is faster than average  it has ionic tourmaline ceramic to enhance drying speed  it is not red but a deep  darker pink   like cherry pepto bismol       it is just a little heavier than average so if you have long  thick hair you may have to arrange some kind of stand for the dryer for part of your drying time to avoid wrist fatigue   the 1875 watts may be a problem in older dwellings which haven t been updated for modern electric needs    but not for the majority  we found it to be an excellent product  best wishes       2 year limited warranty    features   3 heat settings  2 air speed settings  turbo button  cool air button  diffuser attachment  concentrator attachment  removable filter this hair dryer works great and it is cool seeing the fans through the clear plastic but it is bigger and heavier than other hair dryers i have used  it s not outrageously bulky but it different  the attachments are nice and the power cord is sufficiently long that you aren t bound to your outlet  overall a very good  almost professional quality  hair dryer  if you already own a hair dryer  then you re probably okay   unless it s an older model on the fritz   but if you are in the market for a new dryer  then this might be the dryer for you  br    br   granted you aren t going to be using the 200  power all the time  i exaggerate   i m funny      but when you need it  it s nice to know it s there for a quick dry   but quick drying tends to make big bushy hair  so be careful   most of the time i have it on the lower or standard setting   it works great  br    br   it s light  well balanced  and a pretty color   i use it mainly for drying my dog s hair  since i have none    but my gal uses it regularly and really likes it  br    br   again buy if you need a new hair dryer  otherwise you re probably okay   it s like trading in your car   the camry is running fine  so do you need the lexus   if the camry is going kaput then yeah   so the same with the hair dryer   see  informative and funny   you can chuckle now   really   go ahead  i ordered this because of the price and the reviews  it s a decent hair dryer but the bristle attachment  the only one i had planned to use  was flimsy  flimsy in a way that the bristles bend from pressure easily so if you have a lot of hair  it wont go all the way through  i would suggest this item for people with  at most  normal thickness hair  i would not suggest this item for women of darker skin  i myself am caucasian but i have medium thickness  curly hair and i can just barely use it  i have to use the comb attachments and thats not very fun  i suggest this item mostly for women with a little but of curl that they want to straighten out  heavy  it was advertised as light weight but its not really  it is not the heaviest blow dryer but still i was a llittle surprised at the weight  other than that it is excellent my daughter s hair is soft wavy and frizzy and long  it takes a lot to straighten it out but this dryer left her hair soft and straight with a wonderful shine to it  i would and have recommend this to others  a very nice hair dryer that has a diffuser for those of us with curly hair   it s not really a mini  but it s not super huge either   it lives up to the no frizzie reviews and dries your hair extremely fast   there are 3 heat settings and 2 speed settings   it dries fast even at medium heat and low speed   there is also a cool button that cancels all heat and locks your style  it also cools your head down before you go out in the cold winter air   it is heavier than most hair dryers   i would buy it again  i purchased this haridryer for one reason  i broke both of my elbows in a fall and needed to have a lightweight dryer to use after the splints came off   this hairdryer is by far the lightest i have seen and it has been easy for me to use   this may be important for people with muscle nerve arthritic issues and should be considered for this reason  there are only two speeds and settings so you can not have high heat on a low speed and visa versa  it was more than i expected  package was deluxe and product quality is super   i am in love with my hair dryer  this is the most amazing dryer  three heat settings  two speed settings    a turbo speed   wow  my hair gets dried fast  it s not a heavy dryer to hold either which means that it s easier to maneuver into whatever weird position you need it and with the concentrator and diffuser i get a nice blow out and no frizzles  one of my fav things too is that it has a filter that you can take out and clean once in a while just in case you are in a habit of spraying product while you blow like i am then you don t have to worry about gunking up the filter  great dryer   i ll never use a hotel dryer again cause this one is traveling with me  the hairdryer looks elegant  of very light weight   i used high warm speed to blow dry then used medium hot to style my bob   i do have some problem though to set the right side of my hair using my left hand   it is not very intuitive with the design of the shape  over 10 years ago i bought a wall mounted blow dryer after using it in a hotel while on a business trip  i loved it   when that died  i couldn t find a dryer in any retail store that came close to its quality and durability   well  i have now  the oster wall mounted dryer is easy to set up and easier to use  it s powerful  but compact  it dries my hair faster  and styles it better than any product i ve used to date  no popped circuit breakers  either  so i know it uses less energy   i won t be needing another blow dryer for the next decade  and is that ever nice  the dryer light stopped working after 3 weeks  it did not matter much  today  exactly 1 year and 3 days after my purchase the on off switch stopped working and i had to use the breaker on the unit to turn it off  i called the manufacturer and confirmed that the warranty is 1 year  but since it is just couple of days over  they agreed to send me a replacement  it is a direct connect so i need to take the wiring out and replace it with a new one  oh well   at least i got a replacement  great little inexpensive sturdy hair dryer   because i m on a healthy hair journey i was looking for a hair dryer that wouldn t expose my hair to too much direct heat so the styling attachments act as a something of a barrier between the dryer and the hair and i can get my 4a b textured hair relatively straight on medium heat a few passes using the larger if the 2 comb attachments when i need to do a trim or a length check  mounted both items in the master bathroom  i m completely satiefied with them  strong air flow nice cord length and easy instalation  i bought this hair dryer based on a recommendation from good housekeeping and other amazon reviews   it s powerful  dries and styles my very thick and long hair in a fraction of the time my old hair dryer did   only drawback   it s a bit heavy  i love this little lightweight hair dryer  i used it at a motel in point pleasant  n j  i could not wait to purchase my own  more powerful than my other dryer with a lot more voltage  got this for over a month now  it is working great  i usually do not dry my hair  but living in ne there are a lot of snow days in the winter  i need to dry my hair before i head out  i am very satisfied with this hair dryer  no complains  my wife use it every day   good hair dryer  oster professional 76932 710 wall mount hair dryer    great   my wife love this  its very compact with a folding handle  it has an option for warm or normal air  much more is that it s auto volt so you can use it anywhere  a true travel dryer styler  highly recommended  i love this blow dryer   i have gone through about five now  and of all of them this is the best one   it gets my hair straighter and silky   it always has a good shine and never leaves that static cling effect   also all of the attachments are great   this hair dryer does a very fine job of dryng my hair  however  i am not sure i have ever had a hand held dryer which did not  the reason i purchased this dryer was for its retractability  this feature worked great for about a month  now  i cannot seem to get it to completely retract   maybe 5 inches at most  it is too bad i really liked the idea  bought this to replace a higher wattage hair dryer   we would keep tripping circuit breakers with the old hair dryer  1800w  i think  since it nearly maxed out the 15a circuit   this lower wattage hair dryer still seems to dry hair just fine and just as fast  i think fan speed has more to do with drying time than high wattage    the textured plastic surface is easy to grip and the small size makes it easy to pack for trips   hightly recommended  i absolutely love this hair dryer  i have long and very very thick hair  so i need a powerful dryer  i ve tried many of the dryers one could find at the local rite aid or cvs and even after an hour my hair would still not be entirely dry   this one does the job in about 20 minutes and it is also very small and relatively light weight  from what i ve looked at  this is the strongest travel size hair dryer out there and after taking it with me on a 3 state spanning business trip i was very glad with the fact that it was half the size and much stronger than my old solano  which  for the record  i love  but is just really large and inconvenient to lug around in a suitcase   i also love that the dryer has a loop so that i could hang it on a hook  as my bathroom doesn t have much storage space   i would recommend this to everyone  especially if you need something you can travel with  my next purchase will be the 2400w babyliss  once i can find it in the us  since i am using this on almost a daily basis  to take to and from the gym  i find it to be a little more heavy than i would prefer   however  it works well and dries pretty quickly with minimal frizz   i like that it has the cool shot option   i ended up getting the baby bliss travel dryer because it is about 1 2 the weight and i really like it   however  it doesn t have the cool temp option so i m hanging onto this one for backup  i am a hair dresser in nyc  i typically need a new blow drier ever year or so  usually i buy this one  when i haven t and i have tried other driers  and there have been many   they are never as good as this one  if you are shopping for an at home drier this will last forever  it is very light  its fast  its hot  you can turn the ionic function off  which if you have coarser frizzier hair that is what you need anyway   it is also pretty hardy  my tools get dropped all the time  other driers crack and stop working quickly  but not this one    you can t go wrong here  and the diffuser that goes with this drier is really great too   enjoy  the remington ac2015 tstudio salon collection pearl ceramic is a wonderful hair dryer   it is very noticeably quieter than any other hair dryer i have ever had   compared to other dryers i have used  it leaves my long straight hair full of body and never adds static electricity   it is definitley worth the  33 99 i paid for it  it s nice to buy a product that actully performs exactly as it was described in the marketing materials  there s definitely some valid technology that keeps your hair from frizzing out  very happy with this unit  so far  this is the best hair dryer i ve ever used  i like the hair dryer very much   my old one was really loud   this is not at all   nice color   very pleased i bought it  this hair dryer is the best we have found yet  it puts out a concentrated stream of air that is not too hot but drys your hair quickly  it has an easy to use mount for the dryer  only negative is the instructions for mounting on the wall  which are backward  but once mounted it is a joy  wife likes it  so i m happy  anything to keep that nag off my back  loud  which is a good thing  can t hear the ball and chain complaining about the bathroom walls  sink  toilet  mirrors  lights  outlets  shower  safe    unfortunately      my wife has tried many hairdryers and i couldn t believe how satisfied she was with this hair dryer     totally worth it  bought for our motor home  installed easily and works great   it is small enough to be out of the way yet has the power needed  i have thick hair that is almost to the bottom of my lower back  or top of my bottom  lol   standard hair dryers max capacity that cost more took at least double the time to get my hair from wet to dry  it s amazing  i love that it has the ionic  capability and the cool air  to help decrease the frizzie s and keep my hair style set  not that hair that long has much style     it did come with attachments that i have no idea what their purpose is  so those are kind of a waste     i was initially concerned the first few days because the temp  seemed to be fluctuating  however after a few uses it smoothed out  the cord is really long  which is great because the only outlet i have in my bathroom has ruined several blow dryers by melting the plug  so i m easily able to plug in else where an still reach the bathroom   i m thrilled that drying my hair is not a ten to fifteen minute ordeal  closer to five  every minute counts when your getting ready  hang up wall mounted hair dryer fit right in the spot the old dryer was mounted  powerful enough    i choice this particular dryer for the little knob that holds the cord up out of the way of countertop clutter   and the bonus of the night lite  i overlooked in the description online   is great for nite trips to the potty  nite lite can be shutoff if needed   it sits nice and tidy in the room  up and out of the way of countertop  i ordered this hair dryer on friday  and received it on monday  extremely fast shipper  and the hairdryer works amazing  the air heats up extremely quickly  and it dried my hair so fast without damaging it  overall  i m pleasantly surprised with how awesome this hair dryer is for the price    excellent 100   satisfecho por la compra de este producto  sobre todo lo rapido que fue la transaccion de la compra a traves de amazon   trank you  i am convinced that you need a great product to be able to straighten your hair out and have it look great   this blow dryer has made all the differece in how fast and nice my hair blows dries straightening out  this hair dryer works great   my first purchase broke after just two weeks  the heating element became too hot and the hairdryer shut off   my replacement however has been fine   drys hair quickly and leaves it feeling smooth and silky   it is light weight and easy to hold while styling with a brush in the other hand  i have finely textured  shoulder length hair  but a lot of it  so it seems to take forever to dry it   my old dryer was pretty heavy  so much so my shoulder would begin to hurt before i could finish   this past august  i stayed at the courtyard by marriott while moving my son into his college dorm   having to pack lightly for myself  i counted on using whatever dryer the hotel provided   when i saw how small the andis pro style 1600 dryer in the hotel room was  i was skeptical of its power   i was pleasantly surprised   in addition to being lightweight  it was very effective   i remarked to my husband at how quickly i was able to dry my hair  even with the florida humidity  and that i wanted one of the dryers   since i could get it on amazon for  13 99  i thought what the heck  i won t be gambling too much if it doesn t work   i have been using it at least 3 times a week for the last 9 weeks or so without any problems  my dogs did not like it when we used the old dryer on them after a bath  but it is almost as if they like this one  of course  i do wonder how long a  14 hairdryer will last  but my hairstylist told me andis is a very reputable brand   regardless  it has been worth every penny  highly recommend  cons  low speed is too low  high speed is too high   it doesn t blow hot air for the first 5 minutes   speed button is hard to control quickly  i always go past the off when i want it to switch off   it reminds me of cheap hotel blow dryers   the back doesn t have a filter  so my hair gets stuck in it if i turn wrong  br    br   pros  it was cheap   it s lightweight  br    br   just pay  3 more for the better model  i had another  blow dryer just like this one and it finally died on me   i went in search of it at all the local stores   i couldn t find it  so i bought a couple other ones that i ended up returning  because i didn t like them   therefore  i was pretty happy when i found this close match on amazon   i m very happy with it  this hairdryer worked as advertised for about 10 months    after that point  the fan stopped working and it got really hot and overheated in about a second   we ll see how good the customer service is  the hair dryer itself works pretty well  but the retractable cord is completely misleading  it stopped retracting on its own after i used it twice  with that said  the folding handle still makes it easy to store  good buy for the price  any girl women will fall in love with the look of this dryer  its definitely made to impress anyone who is looking for a product that works and looks great too  i bought it for the same reason  i own a remington straightener and almost can t live without it  this one compliments it perfectly   the weight of the dryer is perfect  it does not feel heavy and is comfortable to work with  i wash my hair almost daily and this dryer comes in handy every time  it comes with bonus diffuser and concentrator attachments  i have very thin and fine hair and the diffuser seems like its made for a person with thick hair  its too big for my hair    the features that i love in this product are   1  it has a removable air intake screen which make cleanup so easy    2  its sleek design and light weight   3  long cord and heat settings   features i wish were addressed   1  it makes a lot of noise and my husband always complaints about that   2  though the cord is long and convenient for usage  its difficult to store because its not retractable   overall its a great buy and i can see myself using it for a very long time  i read a lot of reviews before purchasing this  and i m glad i listened to them  this is a powerful  easy to use dryer  it gets the job done  and while i use styling products  it does help make it somewhat silky smooth  definitely recommend  love it  love it  love it     in renovating our bathrooms  we added an amenity i so appreciate in hotels   convenience to our over nighters  and   in baggage weight  are both a plus to them as well  the night light is great for the grandbabies also   amazon s cumulative   point system and free shipping cannot be beat  it was a pleasure to receive this product quickly in the mail  i m extremely pleased with the transaction and with the hair dryer  thank you  i read about the john frieda full volume hair dryer in a magazine  and it has more than lived up to its review   dries quickly  leaves hair soft  with no frizzies  and with lots of body   it s made my wavy  mind of its own hair behave for the first time   i highly recommend this product   couldn t live without it  lots of power behind the air  cool shot button and cool setting  which i love because my old one only had the shot button which made me have to keep it held in entire time if i wanted cool air        got this for my wife she loves it   did my research on which hair dryer to get and the power on this one is incredible   still noisy  all hair dryers are   but less so then some of the previous high end ones she has used  this hair dryer is the best   it is light weight and has two powerful heat levels   i first used this hair dryer in a marriott hotel   i loved it so much that i wrote down the name  so i could order one for myself   so happy i did   asin b001ue7d32 andis 30095 micro turbo 1200 watt hair dryer   got this hair dryer after my hot tools pink zebra one broke  while it s not as cute it does dry my hair better  i am loving how light weight it is  i have long hair and sometimes my arm gets tired from being up in the air that long  but this blow dryer is very light weight and packs a punch too  it dries my hair pretty fast and cuts out some of the frizz with the ions  overall i love it  i love this hairdryer  perfect size   the night light is perfect in the bathroom   this is the second one i purchased  a few months after purchasing  the high setting became low and the dryer began shooting sparks out of it  this dryer is a fire hazard and does not function properly  purchase at your own risk  i love this dryer   it really does take away the frizzies  i d give it 5 stars but it is a bit heavy and the cord is super long  i found this is really worth for me i ll definitely prefer this drier to everyone  it dries hair    just within 5min  i bought this dryer in a rush at target and have regretted it ever since  my main issue with the design are the buttons  they are meant to be slid into position but i usually cannot get it to budge and have to try to force it my thumb nail  which isn t very pleasant  br    br   it s also very loud and it constantly makes a popping crackling what have you noise like it may explode any moment  i used this dryer for four days while staying at a hyatt hotel  i was immediately impressed by how powerfully and quickly it dried my hair   the retractable cord was an instant hit with me as well  the cord on my current dryer is presently tangled up all over my bathroom sink  br    br   it is a bit heavy and bulky  i wasn t aware that it folded   br    br   i wasn t in the market for a dryer  but i liked this one enough after my hotel test drive that i will be purchasing one immediately  br    br   update nov 2012  so  i ve used this daily for a year  a good dryer  i must admit i don t find anything particularly different about this ionic dryer as compared to other dryers  e g   i can t say my hair is shinier or more manageable   still  a good  but heavy  dryer  i m still enjoying that retractable cord  i have heard about how great tourmaline hairdryers are for years  but had never tried one  i m a total convert at this point    the t3 dries my curly hair straight and shiny  and it weighs practically nothing  it s a quiet yet very powerful little machine  this is the second version of this dryer ive had  almost exactly the same setup as the first  great power as usual  i have a lot of hair so power is essential to speed up my morning routine   my only complaint  just like the model before  is that the hot air comes out of the separation between the buttons and the frame and can bother my hands  it s manageable  and again i ll take it because of the power  the other thing i should mention is that i had the first version for over 3 years before the motor finally gave in  so good purchase as it lasted a while  hair dryer was very easy to install and looks nice on the wall   the design of base and cord holder keeps everything in its place   the night light is sufficently bright for late nite visits to the john   the dryer works sufficently and as expected  i purchased two of these  one white and one black  and the night lights they have are plenty bright and look very nice  the problem is that they don t last  the night light in the white one went out on the second day  the night light in the black one went out on the third day  after i drilled the holes to mount them  i didn t really want to bother with the hassle to return them since the hair dryers both work fine   i m pretty sure i saw a cheaper version of these without the night light  and that s what i d recommend  i m used to a bit more wind from my regular dryer  at three times the size  but these dryers still complete the job in about the same amount of time   the ones i received do have the coiled cord  exactly like the picture  some say they received straight cords  and it turns off automatically when you return the dryer to the holder   my only complaints are the night lights going out  of course  and the fact that you can t remove the dryer from the holder to pack in a suitcase  which is a shame because they are very small and would be great for travel if you could   all in all i m happy with the purchase  the hair dryer runs a little hotter than i wanted   otherwise it is a good dryer for those who want a less powerful hair dryer  have 2 position warm and hot  which i really like and another feature  hight and low   u can choose what u want and best for hair  and to make nice hair style it have cool buttom which is good too  if u have thin hair   it will be perfect for u  fast dryer   what can be better     i recomend u this product  this is a great dryer  but its a little too heavy  it dries very quickly and does not harm hair  i really enjoyed getting my hairdryer off the countertop  but i ll have to do it with a different brand in the future  i purchased this unit 9 months ago  a few days ago  the switch stopped working for medium and high settings  i sent a note to the company via their website asking for assistance and haven t heard back from them  i m sure they ll replace it under warranty  but why would i spend  10 in shipping for a  20 product to get what would probably be a refurbished model  i suggest you look at other options  which is what i m going to do now  i purchased a hairdryer for over  100 from this vendor in jan 2009   i filled out all the warranty forms and submitted to t3 as expected  now it s october of 2011 and it is already breaking  i was sold a pos  so when i contacted the manufacturer about the dryer no longer functioning properly  they responded via email that this vendor and amazon com are not an authorized resellers of t3 products and my dryer is not covered under the warranty  now i am royally hosed    i highly suggest not purchasing any products that may require a warranty fix from any vendor like this  i attached this great dryer to my wall in the master bathroom  it is secure and so nice not to have to dig the dryer out of a drawer or from under the sink  it looks fantastic and works perfectly  i thought this blow dryer worked great and i wish i could give it more stars  i was using it today and the power switch broke  it s completely broken and now i have to throw the whole thing away  what a waste of money  i had been shopping with amazon for about 3 5 yrs and never had one instance of a bad experience  after a lot of research  i nailed to buy this item  i was excited to see that it would get delivered in 2 days  i was eagerly waiting for it  an unknown carrier called ensenda was chosen to deliver this to me  they took their own sweet 3 days after much of follow ups from me to deliver the item  with much expectation  i opened the item just to find out it would not work  i was doubting my own mental caliber to operate such a simple instrument  tried out different options  nothing would work  i took the drier to 4 different power points in the house  no luck  to make sure that i m not doing a mistake  i asked my roomie to check if it would work  no luck  the first thing i did next day morning was to ship this back to amazon and got a conair ion shine ceramic 1875  also  buyers please dont get carried away by its glossy looks  it looks stylish in the image  but looks cheap in reality  the control buttons are also bad  i m very happy with my conair  it looks pretty sophisticated with beautiful controls for just 13 28 dollars   tax  thanks to amazon that it forced me out of a pathetic choice  i love amazon as always   guess i should condier myself lucky  at least mine is working     so far anyway  a lot bigger than i had hoped it would be  high speed has lots of volume  but doesn t seem as forceful as my last hair dryer  guess some things require a visit to a real store  otherwise  it s okay  just hope it stays working  this is a cadillac of a hair dryer  it handles more than your basic drying needs  it is reasonably priced and is made by a quality manufacturer   it more than meets my needs by having multiple blower speeds  heat selections and a dryer adapter  the cord is flexible  long enough and doesn t easily tangle  bind up while using it   all features work well  in addtion  it is realitively quiet and the unit feels sturdy in the hand  further  i have yet to experience my hair getting inadvertantly pulled into the dryer  i have long  straight hair   really comfortable to use because it is lightweight  the settings are great  3 speed and 3 temperature settings   love that they are slide buttons not push buttons to avoid accidental presses  heats up your hair  not your hand  only thing i wish was that the wire was longer   it s plugged into a knee height socket and it s just about long enough for me to stand in front of it and dry my hair without moving from the spot  this product is great  very powerful and incredibly silent for all the air that it blows  works great and i can dry my hair right after the shower  no need to wait anymore  highly recommended  i received this hair dryer a while back and it works wonderfully   i used to just let my hair air dry because most dryers just take too long   this one dries quickly and i love the multiple settings  amazon sent product on time as promised  dryer is a small  compact and powerful  the new black finish is nice     not shiny black but soft matte feel to it  gets hair dry relatively fast  very good for use as a travel dryer or at home  this product is exactly what i wanted   the dryer is just like the ones you find in your hotel room   it is quick and powerful for drying your hair  hangs nicely on the wall  i have also used it without it hanging on the wall  much nicer to use when it is hung on the wall   if you want a hair dryer that is powerful and small this is the one  el producto es muy bueno  no tengo ningun problema con el  ya fue utilizado y esta como lo esperaba  br    br   the product is very good  i have no problem with it  already been used and is as expected  this is the second revlon hair dryer i ve purchased in the last four years and both times it had the same problem    overheating where the cord enters the handle   this one lasted a month  the previous one    a forty dollar item    lasted two months and almost caused a fire while i was using it  i do not recommend revlon hair dryers and will not purchase one again          added on oct 13  2011   well  once it started showing overheating problems that i recognized from previous revlon dryer  i went ahead and ordered an andis 1600 watt which is also a very low price but pretty strong hair dryer  my previous andis worked for several years with no problem and i loved it before it conked out on me and i would have ordered another but it was out of stock at the time  so i ordered the revlon instead  sigh  so  one month later i am tossing the revlon and fortunately the andis is back in stock now and arrived two days before my revlon popped loudly and frizzled and fried and died an ignominious death this evening  so i had a back up in place  thank you andis  i will not be buying anything but andis hair dryers from now on  the revlon is not worth buying imo  my daughter uses it regularly  it does a good job drying and is easy to use  she actually sets up her art table and works while drying her hair  this andis ionic hair dryer is not only powerful  but also smart with the foldable head and retractable chord   if you are looking for a great  no nonsense chord at a nice price  then get this one  i have been using this blow dryer for about a month now   it is good for my hair because i have thin hair and it doesn t burn my scalp on high   if you have thick hair i would recommend another andis hairdryer   it does leave my hair nice and smooth   i really love it  this product is well made   was an excellent purchase  it is used constantly  has variable heat setting  the night light is particularly useful in the bathroom when it s dark  i will be buying more for my other bathrooms   good value for money  i just paid 189 00 for this hair dryer on another site  not amazon  because i read the reviews amazon is not an authorized dealer and the problems people had with this dryer and returning it  or warranty  whatever    my least concern was this i just wanted to be sure i was getting the evolution and not some other model with the name evolution  on it   first  omg  what  who are these people on here giving this hair dryer such rave reviews   this dryer is not even 1600 watts                          how can anyone say best hair dryer ever  no need for the low setting as the high is perfect  blah blah   i am convinced that i can no longer go by reviews on here  this dryer is in no way 2000 watts   i can hold the nozzle  with the nozzle on which is more extreme air flow  right to my skin and my sking doesnt even get close to warm   how can this dryer be 20000 watts when it is barely blowing out any air to even directly make it to my round brush and it doesnt burn my skin at all directly up against my skin on the highest setting  which is supposed to be hot   this is in now way hot  no way 20000 watts  i dont even think this is 1600   what are all you people thinking to write reveiws with a dryer that is no stronger than a conair at cvs   i cannot in good conscious keep a dryer that i paid almost 200 for where my vidal sassoon dryer gives off more air flow   i have no respect for a company that lies to every one  puts out a dryer that is even in the news and yet sells top popele the exact opposite    why are not you all saying the truth   i have the dryer   it is not even 1600 watts and that is no lie   plus  i paid 200 for a dryer where the cold button i have to hold down     the cheaper dryers  yes   but i also bought an 1875 bioionic dryer and it blows stronger and harder than this piece of garbage   and its cool button stays cool without holding it down   the only positive of this dryer is light weight   but i can get that at the local drug store for 30 00  pleaswe people  think before you write reviews and be honest   i have to believe these sites are deceptive becau8se i have the dryer  i used it and it is clearly and no mistake or even maybe  this is clearly not even 1600 watts  so light air flow i thought my electric ay be the problem   so light it didnt burn my skin on highest hot setting up agaqinst my arm   are you kidding me people   this is not a dryer worth  50 00   do not buy this garbage and i for one will never ever trust this company again  they have wasted my money  time and now i have to return this piece of garbage   i can t believe the lie of telling people waht a great piece of workmanship   what is so great   it is light  plastic  1600 watt cheap deryer   that s it  does what it s supposed to  love the retractable cord  i dont really care about the color  inexpensive  but really loud  oh well  can t have it all in life  overall  it s a good product  i got this dryer for my wife as she has fine  relatively delicate hair and every dryer she has ever used has made it dry and harder to manage  in the past i heard many complaints   did this dryer fare any better  well she hasn t had that problem with this dyer  and to me that s saying a lot  br    br   john frieda is a salon product label not an appliance manufacturer  but they seem to have chosen quite well the bathroom appliance to put their name on  it s well designed  attractive  and  most importantly  well built and effective as what it s designed to be used for  as my wife is the hair care expert i relied on her expert experience with this device for the bulk of the info for this review  but for the record  here s my two cents  her hair looks less damaged  smoother and softer  has less split ends  and in general looks healthier with use of this device  the only downside i can see is that it is a bit large  now on to her opinions    br   the number one thing my wife said she likes about the dryer is the ample number of heat and speed settings  these allow you to customize the dryer to your specific hair texture in order to dry your hair as quickly as possible  with the least damage done  it also has a cold shot button  a feature she would like better if it had a lock  it gets tiring trying to hold the button continually  br    br   she also likes that it comes with three attachments  a diffuser and two concentrators   these are made of sturdy plastic  and are very easy to snap on and off the nozzle  however  they do heat up very quickly during use so switching between them while blow drying can be a little uncomfortable  the device also has a nice long power cord which is convenient  br   the only really  con  with this dryer would be its size  we have very limited storage space in my bathroom and this dryer takes up a lot of space  however  considering everything else this dryer has to offer it s not a deal breaker in the least  i would recommend this dryer to anyone looking for a fast and effective dryer  that won t cause a lot of damage to your hair   even with daily use   especially recommended to people with fine or delicate hair  it s an excellent value for a great price  well done john frieda and effective dryer  that won t cause a lot of damage to your hair   even with daily use   especially recommended to people with fine or delicate hair  it s an excellent value for a great price  well done john frieda  i ordered my hair dryer for one day shipping i received have used it and give it 5 stars    it works fine  no issues  i have small hands and this is lightweight enough it doesnt tire my hands    took like 5 minutes to dry my hair and it is thick and holds water    for  20 this is perfect  the hair dryer it is an excelen product  it works properly  so far so good i recommend the andis 82005  i first tried this dryer at a time share  i was so impressed with how fast it dried my hair that i bought one and mounted it on the wall in my bathroom at home  now it s always handy to grab  and it doubles as a night light  it just plugs in  no wiring involved  this is my second purchase  it was a birthday gift for a girlfriend  she is equally delighted by this dryer s speed  i am so glad my other dryer bit the dust  this dryer is the nicest one i have ever owned  it dries my hair quickly without blowing like a tornado and my hair is a whole lot less frizzy  exactly as described   powerful dryer   only used it two days so far  but seems to have cut my drying time   lighter weight than my old one   overall would recommend  my wife has had conair hair dryers in the past that have lasted many years  old one finally died  wanted the same pistol grip style so bought the blackbird pro  thinking it would last even longer  this one only lasted 19 months before the bearings went out and i am told by conair it only has a 12 month warranty  paid  30 for it  but was able to buy a different cheaper model at walmart for  17 with a 24 month warranty  go figure  i love this  i ve had it about 6 months now and it works very well  i like that the filter easily comes out and i just really love the pink  good product  the fhi nano salon pro 2000 hair dryer   onyx black was shipped soon after i ordered it  i am a happy customer  i will never buy anything less that than 2000 watt again  it does not dry out my hair  it is very powerful though so make sure you use mocorran oil or at least a comparable oil to mosturize your hair  this is a great hair dryer and would highly recommend it   we already had one family member with this dryer and liked it so much we got a second one  i ve been using this dryer for about 3 weeks now and the airflow on the lowest settings is too strong   even with the diffuser on  my hair frizzes every time   it doesn t dry my hair as fast as i expected it to either   i also don t really like that the controls are on the back of the handle   i end up changing the settings without knowing it   i was using a t3 tourmaline dryer and loved it  but i thought i d try something different this time   i ll be going back to the t3 because it s better in every way   i m giving the fhi to my niece who straightens her hair   i m sure it would be great for her  my favorite blow dryer finally died  so i was forced to buy a new one  i am so glad i did  this blow dryer dries my super thick  long hair way faster than any other blow dryer  and i think it looks shinier and straighter too  the pink color is pretty  and makes it easy to find in my pile of hair instruments  the retractable cord is so nice  it doesn t get tangled in with my 3 curling irons and flat iron   i wish they had the retractable cord too    and the cord doesn t retract too fast and hit you in the hand  great  salon quality blow dryer for a fraction of the cost  omg    this is the hair dryer for you  it straightens your hair especially if you have very very curly twisted hair  you ll get it pin straight with this dryer  the hot setting is hot but it doesn t dry out or burn your hair  it is just soooo worth the money  i ve had mine since 2008 and it still runs like the first day i bought it  i ve taken it traveling with me  yes it is big   i just don t care because i can t live without it  and any of those cheap hotel dryers  burn my hair so much  no matter what  my hair comes out looking awesome from it  just buy it   you won t regret it  my wife described what she wanted  found what she wanted at amazon  it was an easy install and we re both happy  this hair dryer  first off  is great because it s quiet  my daughter despises the noise from most hairdryers and this doesn t bother her in the least  also  its ion technology is much gentler on her hair  and mine   which i m in favor of as well  one of the best features  however  is that it is lightweight  which makes it terrific for travel  not to mention being easy on my forearms and shoulders  i have pretty thick hair and it takes forever to dry   it s a solid piece of equipment and i ve already purchased another  thumbs up  ok  i never write reviews  but this hair dryer is so great  i just had to  it looks very basic  but it is everything you could want in a hair dryer and more  it is powerful  quiet  dries my hair in a flash  and from the very first time i used it  it made my hair amazingly soft and shiny  i didn t even know a hair dryer could make that much difference  this is hands down the best hair dryer i have ever used  i love this hair dryer  i live in a college dorm and share this dryer with my roommate and it s working perfectly  the design is simple and nothing special but it is damn powerful and works great  that is all you need from a blow dryer   i got this dryer and immediately turned it over to my wife  she uses a hair drier frequently and have seen her with frizzy hair from it at times  i figured this would be a perfect test  br    br   the dryer has a balanced feel to it and isn t too heavy  the body is made of plastic that feels solid  if you squeeze it will creak and crack but it still feels solid  the intake and output screens are metal and should hold up well  it has a very nice cable stress relief on the dryer side that looks like it will help with and last through all the waving around that is sure to come  the plug side has a nice and compact gfi built into it so you are less likely to die from using it  size wise i think this is a stay at home dryer  i would look for something a bit more compact for travel if you need one  br    br   the side of the handle contains two switches  one for temperature  cool  warm  and hot  one for speed  off  low  and high   there is a momentary switch on the handle in the trigger position for the cool shot function  br    br   after turning her loose with this for a few weeks my wife says her hair definitely is less frizzy and feels softer after using this dryer versus her other dryer  i can confirm this as well  it feels softer to me and i notice it is less frizzy  br    br   i m sold on it after seeing what it does and as with anything your mileage may vary but it works well for my wife and she wouldn t hesitate to recommend this dryer to her friends  the dryer works ok   nothing special but there was no registration card in the box so i called the manufacturer   they said the warranty is void since amazon is not an authorized dealer   i would like to have known that  so far as i know what i received is a knock off of the real thing   in addition there was no receipt in the box  this is absolutely fabulous  very lightweight and compact when it folds  perfect for travel  cheaper than the retail stores  great product for the money   an awesome color too  this is my second of this particular hair dryer   but the first one lasted 10 years which is amazing   since i couldn t be without a hairdryer  i bought another one   however  i sent in the old one to elchim for repair   on their website it said the repair was  20   that was correct and for  20 i now have a 2nd hairdryer     not that i need it since this product lives up to the hype   this is the hairdryer my hairdresser uses and swears by   i highly recommend the elchim professional 2001 1800 watt classic hair dryer  great blow dryer  it takes half the time to blow dry my hair like my old one did and takes a lot of the frizz off too  i love this blow dryer  highly recommend it  shipped fast   this was a great hair dryer for a couple of months  i received the dryer in may and used it regularly for several months  in august i noticed that it just didn t feel hot any more  i pushed all the switches and button up and down  in and out several times to see if something was stuck but no luck  it just stopped blowing hot air   i immediately contacted andis via email and asked what i should do about the malfunctioning dryer but as of now  3 weeks later  no response from andis  bummer  this is a professional quality dryer and dries my hair more quickly than any other one i ve owned  and it does it quietly   it s also very lightweight and therefore easy on my arms because i blow my hair out every morning   i told my hair stylist what i bought and she said it should easily last me 5 years   great feedback on the seller  too   my order came quickly and as described  new in box  this product works great  it dries my hair extremely fast and does not leave it frizzy that s a plus to someone with curly hair  got this conair wallmount hair dryer about a month ago to replace the one we had for about 15 years that finally blew up  it s the most convenient dryer you can own  didn t even have to replace the wall mount bracket  new unit was exactly the same as the old  but   gotta say i m really glad we kept the old unit  the rear filter screen on the new unit fell right off out of the box  the 2 little tabs that snap the screen onto the main housing were like melted smooth and could not be fixed  but the screen on the old unit was an exact match  so   snap off  snap on  and viola  back in business  lucky for us  and amazon  or they d have to pay for an exchange  and we d be stuck using a clunky  10 pound albatross dryer for bout a week or so  amazon s delivery was 1 2 days quicker than i expected  good price too  oh  the built in night light is real handy too  worked great for at least 15 years  i really like this hair dryer enough to buy a second one  the first one made a popping sound and quit so hopefully this one will do better    videoid mo20ufht4c35874  the john frieda jf1 full volume hair dryer is one heck of a hair dryer  it is both powerful and hot and helps to take a few minutes out your morning routine  while it has many of the same features and attachments of other hair dryers it does offer salon style performance  br    br   notes  br    br      heats up very quickly br      long cord   probably 8 10 feet which allows you a little freedom from your outlet br      3 speeds and three heat settings br      the back screen lifts up so that you can clean the dryer motor br      it is a bit heavy  which is the reason for removing one star br      nice look to the dryer   it certainly does not look or feel cheap br      three attachments including a diffuser and two concentrators br      1875 watts  watch to make sure you do not trip your circuit breaker  br    br   final verdict   this is a well built machine that will likely last you for many years  what some of the features are quite common this is still a hair dryer that should be seriously considered by anyone looking to make a purchase  br    br   4 1 2 stars this is a very nice hairdryer  my wife and daughters have many  and this one has quickly become the default  when i asked them why  i got the shoulder roll and i dunno  i like it  so there you go  about the best one can say for a nice green folding hairdryer in this price range  it works  it s lightweight  and gets the job done  great for traveling  this is a very nice hairdryer   it is lightweight and i love that the cord is stored inside and the handle folds   it is not overpowering and dries my hair very quickly   i would highly recommend it   it is easy to pack if you want to take it with you on a trip  the hair dryer itself is very good   just what i wanted  however the wall anchors that the dryer is secured to the wall with are useless  dont know why a company disregards how important these small things are  another trip to lowe s   the reason i bought this hair dryer is because of the retractable cord and the folding handle  the fact that it s a great dryer and ionic was a plus  my only complaint is the cord does not always retract back into the dryer  you have to pull it out and try again  if you re not careful and pull too much it will be stuck out permanently  this happened to me   i tried taking apart the dryer to fix it but ended up throwing the blow dryer away because i couldn t get it back together  i bought another one and now i am more careful  this conair dryer is decent  the extension makes it most convenient to use while sitting on the floor  which can be convenient  also the air only comes from out of the back  and not the front or the sides  and no matter what the setting is you ll need to be under the dryer for at least an hour  but  for the price  and if you can find some comfortable way to sit  it is worth it for those days when you don t have time to head to the hair salon  works well  dries hair quickly  and it does reduce frizzing  very light for its size  i have accidentally turned it off while holding it a few times  but it s easy to correct by holding it a little higher up  it s not really a big deal  definitely worth it for the price  i think that the hair dryer is ok   i just like at picture  is not bad for the cost    is great   d this is a very good qaulity hair dryer   it is light weight  has plenty of power and yet is incredibly quiet   much better than a previous version that had the power but also the added weight   the andis 82005 closes the gap between merely a consumer product and a professional dryer  but retains a reasonable price  the product works perfectly  other dryers suck my wifes hair into the intake  very fine hair  this dryer does not do that  when she is happy so am i am a hairdresser for 20 years  i ve had tried so many different blow dryers but this works wonders on every hair types no other blow dryer make the hair silky and shiny like silver bird but it will not last long  like in two months it will brake  every two or three months i buy new one as i did not find a better blow dryer i will keep buying it   very happy with product   very quite operationally  it was a bit tricky to mount on the wall  but that was probably just me  i ve bought this dryer four months ago and so far so good  it s not the best that i ve ever had  but works well for the price  when i first pulled it out of the box i was surprised to find that mine at least had a sparkly finish but i decided to try it before passing any judgments on how the product works  i m happy i did  the dryer has 6 settings each tailored to a different hair type  which is great  in addition to that handy perk  it also has instant cool for setting styles  my hair is always very soft and pretty after using the dryer  glad to say that i love it  this is a first class hair dryer  br   well built  looks good and performs better  br   the 1800  watts drys your hair faster than the typical 1500 watt units most companies sell yet the motor is quieter than these other units  br   the only point that some may consider a negative is that it isn t very portable  no retracting power cords  no folding handles  but it isn t meant to be portable  most people use their dryers at home anyway and travelers will have to either accept its somewhat larger size because of its superior performance and lack of carrying case or look for a portable unit  br    br   this dryer has three speeds where most dryers only have two  it has three attachments  one is a diffuser  t3 charges an extra  20 30 just for their diffuser alone  to puff up your hair with its teeth that have air outlets at the end of each tooth and two different styles of concentrators to develop very high air speeds and concentrate the drying for quicker performance  works great for drying a spill spot on your clothing   br    br   it also has a cool button to blow cold air which is handy for spraying hair spray and then fixing your hair in that position  i find it also handy for blowing dust out of the fans and keyboard of my computer as well  br    br   finally  it is not too heavy despite its thicker plastic construction  some have criticized it as not having a metal body  it disagree  a metal body would be heavier and is also dangerous where electric and water are present  which is where many people use their hair dryers  br    br   so not only is a metal body more tiring to use for any amount of time but is hazardous to your heath if used in a bathroom  pro dryers may be metal bodied but a beauty salon is not a bathroom and it is handled by a beautician  not yourself  so the dangers are minimized a great deal  br    br   if you want a pro performing dryer without paying the pro prices   120 200  they cost  this is the dryer for you  my hairdresser uses this hair dryer and i asked her about it since it always leaves my hair so impeccably styled   i went ahead and ordered it here and i m very happy with it   elchim is solid  yet lightweight  dries hair extremely fast  is surprisingly quiet   and it leaves my hair smooth and glossy   super long cord is convenient  plus its beautiful   it looks like a high performance sports car  this hair dryer is reasonably priced for the quality of the product  the sleek design  quiet operation  and versatile settings were what i was looking for in a replacement hair dryer  and this product delivers  i ve only used it twice and am already in love with it  this dryer worked fine enough for about a month after i bought it from target   maybe a little slower than my normal drying time  but overall it was fine  i used it around three times a week in the morning  went to plug it in yesterday and turned it on  and nothing happened but a tiny little pop  since then i ve tried resetting the switch on the plug itself as well as tried various outlets around the house  something seems to have shorted out in it  i figured a hair dryer was a hair dryer and the  20 one should work just as well  but after this experience and after using better ones that my friends have had serve them well for several years and dry my hair more quickly  i think i ll pony up the extra  20 and save myself the headache of having to buy another hair dryer in the near future  it s possible mine was just defective  but even if it hadn t gone out on me  i probably would have gotten a nicer dryer for myself as a treat at some point anyway  knowing how often i use blow dryers and how much better they work on my thicker hair  some have commented that this blow dryer is heavy  it doesn t seem heavier than any other powerful dryer  and it dries hair twice as quick as others we ve had that are marketed as professional strength  my daughter s hair is thick and very long  i m sometimes asked to start drying it while she puts on her makeup  it s a request i welcome  any moments w my daughter who goes away to college are stolen  it s a far shorter task with this dryer  and neither of us end up sweating      re comments about the attachments not staying on the nozzle  i duly noted that  and therefore it did not frustrate me when i found that was sometimes the case  we re not big attachment users  and i know where the duct tape is  given its overall performance  it isn t a deal breaker  i ve paid a lot more money for a lot less  if this has the staying power  and doesn t burn out faster than more expensive ones we ve had  it will rank as one of my best buys from amazon  this is by far the best hairdryer i have ever used  i have a very sensitive scalp and after using my sisters hairdryer once i had a blistery rash on the back of my head  i never want to go through that again  this hairdryer blows teehee  strong enough for my thick hair  distributes enough heat so i don t have to get close to my scalp at all  the back pops off so you can clean it to keep the air circulation as strong as the first use  also you can t beat the price  great product  this is one sweet hairdryer  stylish  well made and looks well built  i got the whole family to try this out and everyone likes it  br    br   they loved the attachment that helps with frizzled hair and another attachment that seems to give a flat blast out of the dryer  br   it has great controls  hot and warm  with three speed for the fan  it can also be used to blow cold air with a trigger type button under the blower section  br   the cable is long enough and also worth mentioning is the neat box it came in  the style is quite interesting but not overdone and it sure catches the eyes of my kids friends who frequently come over to help each other with their hair styles  br    br   i am quite pleased with this hair dryer  it does what it should with ease  style and power  i m sooo glad i bought this blow dryer  it gets my african american hair really straight and makes flat ironing 10 times easier  the comb attachment is the best part  next to the hot and cool switches you can flip to the position you want without having to hold them down  buy this blow dryer and you won t want another one  i have been using this blow dryer for about 2 months now and i love it   it dries my hair very quickly and the attachments stay put and do not fall off   i can understand why some of the other reviews say the cool button gets in the way   when i first starting using the dryer  i accidentally hit the cool button but i have easily adjusted how i hold the dryer so this no longer happens   that would be my only complaint with the dryer   other than that  i love it   my hair looks great  it takes me much less time to dry my hair  and it s not too heavy   i am happy with my purchase  i wanted a hairdryer that has warm and cool settings and not just hot and hotter   i bought it to dry my little japanese chin after her bath   she hates to be wet and the conair dries her in about 10 minutes  this hair blow dryer is superior to the one i now own   i particularly like the titanium ceramic coated grill and the two concentrators   it has plenty of power  1875 watts  and is lightweight   i also find it advantageous to have 3 heat and 2 speed settings   i was not familiar with this brand  but am impressed  bought this for my wife witch has a lot of hair and is very picky on what she uses for it  she love this hair dryer more than the one ive bought in the past which were really expensive this is a great buy and would recommend it to anyone  this product is amazing  it dries your hair really fast and allows it to be as straight or as curly as you want  this is one of the best hair dryers i have ever had  and i recommend it to everyone  in my rush to get ready for work in the morning  it is nice to have this extra strong dryer to blow on my balding head after my shower for 90 seconds in the early morning light and make it appear that i actually have more hairs than i do  i like the ability to choose a cool as well as a hot air setting  the filter unhinges from the back for easy cleaning  i ve only used this dryer a few times as it is my travel dryer but i love it   the ionic feature works even better than my regular ionic dryer in smoothing the hair  the three speeds are wonderful and very hard to find for a travel dryer   it s a little bigger than most travel dryers but folds up nice and compactly   great product at a good price  this blow dryer is great   really leaves my hair soft  shiny   frizz free   great value for the price   would highly recommend  why is this hair dryer better than your average cheapie dryer  well  most importantly  it s 1875 watts dries your hair very quickly  i have shoulder length  straight  fine but fairly thick hair and this drier has it dry within 5 minutes  i was a little skeptical about the ion thing at first  but i have to admit that my hair does feel a little smoother and softer after using this dryer  what i like most about the dryer is that it has two rocker switches with lots of setting possibilities  one controls the high low off settings and the other controls the hot warm cold  it s nice that you can do them in any combination which makes for a lot of choices  i usually am in a hurry and use the hot and high settings   some day i ll start getting up earlier or start getting ready before the last minute  but until then  i need a dryer like this   it also has a cool button so when you re styling your hair and have a section of hair wrapped around your brush to make it flip up or under you can hit it with the hot air first  and then the cool to set it before unwrapping it  this works so well and so quickly  that it s one of the first hair dryers that i can get away with not using a curling iron and still have my hair styled the way i like it  br    br   this dryer is very spacey looking in a silver gray color with a purple blue racing stripe down the side  the cord is gray  i guess what my hair dryer looks like isn t that big of a deal but why settle for a drab looking one when you can have one with a little pizzaz  it comes with a diffuser and two other attachments for directing the air flow  the size of this dryer is pretty substantial  but it isn t too heavy  it s just a nice weight  i would say it s about average as far as noise goes  i ve actually had travel sized hair dryers that were noisier than this one  all in all it s an excellent dryer that does exactly what i want it to do which is to dry my hair quickly and leave it looking soft and full  i love this hair dryer  first saw it in a hotel and was like woah no cord   so i ordered one and have been using it for over 2 years now  works perfectly  stores small  has plenty of power  br    br   now i am curious if i can find a diffuser attachment for it   anybody know  br    br   m i was looking for something inexpensive for our vacation home so we could put in all the bathrooms   bought 3 of these and very happy  works better than the more expensive ones   have not had any problems thus far and works great  br    br   edit   dropped this to one star   in a year 2 out of the 3 i have bought failed   one sounds like a bearing failing and the other won t get hot anymore   basically they are cheap for a reason   one that failed  even thought a year old  was only used maybe 10 times  this is the best hair dryer i ve ever purchased    it has cut my drying time down to 20 minutes  i have shoulder length thick hair that is prone to frizz  it leaves my soft and smooth  the only downside is that it gets extremely hot and can burn the bristles on a round brush  i ve had to try out different brushes that stand up to the heat and a tourmaline ceramic round brush is the best  overall  i would recommend this to everyone  i bought it in nov  of 2010 and it expired in july of 2011  i have had goldfish live longer  i was using it and it suddenly started smelling like burning rubber  i immediately turned it off  now only the low setting works i have very short hair and it was not used daily  hmm      this is an amazing blow dryer  seriously  i have spent money on models that cost tons more and this has to be the best blow dryer i have ever used  i have extremely thick  coarse hair  they could use it to reinforce the eiffel tower s structure  having hair like this usually means a lot of time and a lot of background music spent in front of the mirror  but with the jf1  i had great results and a true cut down in the time i spent on my hair  and using the diffuser and on a medium setting  along with a heat protectant  i didn t feel as if i was frying my hair to death  at times  i have literally seen smoke arise from my hair using other blow dryers  even on a low setting  br    br   i highly recommend the jf1  it is light weight  not as gigantic as it may seem   a great price point  and does a wonderful job  what more can you ask for   we used this blowdryer in a hotel and liked it   couldn t find it in any stores so i ordered it from amazon   after we got it my husband told me to order another one for a back up and i somehow made two orders   i let my daughter use one and we still have one put up for a back up  my first impression of this hair dryer is its heft  it is not overwhelming  of course  but feels significantly more substantial than the usual plastic laden blowers  it looks substantial too  with no cheap looking material anywhere  br    br   all the normal functions are there  the top button controls hot warm cold  while the second button has the high low off settings  the electric plug is shock proof  and a quick cold button is placed directly under the index finger  br    br   once turned on  the motor immediately makes a statement of its superior quality with its calm low frequency whirl and the strong yet steady airflow  in the long run  this should be what reminds the owner that he she has gotten his her money s worth  the air filter in the back of the unit is sturdy and easy to clean  at 1875w  the heat should be able to satisfy anyone  br    br   overall  the quality and design seem more than enough to justify the price  the only remaining question is longevity  but time will tell  this is the best hair dryer i ve ever had  br    br   the size is not too large or too long  the picture makes it look larger than it actually is  it is light weight  the handle provides a perfect grip  the motor cools down very quickly and the casing does not retain heat  br    br   the buttons are all you could possibly ask for  and they are very conveniently located right on the handle where your fingers wrap around it  you don t have to shift your grip or stop what you are doing to change a heat setting or blow setting  don t think that your fingers could accidently trip a botton  they are raised buttons and have a definite angle and curve and your fingers have to purposefully push them one way or the other to make changes  the cold buttom works very quickly  too  br    br   there is a loop for hanging  a safety plug and a long cord  br    br   it has the normal attachments  plus a pretty nifty one that is suited for nice  long  fine hair  it will be able to help lift a large section of hair and shoot many channels of air into the section  br    br   last  but not least  it is a beautiful thing to look at  the box it comes in is classy  too  i got goose bumps when i first took it out of the box  no kidding  i can t believe someone didn t think of this sooner  best product i have bought in a very long time  love having two hand to manipulate my hair how i want it  i am very pleased with the strength of hold the suction cup has on my mirror  the whole thing feels very sturdy  i just purchased this and only used it once or so but i really like the way my hair feels after using it  it s a bit heavy and bulky  thus the one point off   but otherwise quite nice  i do recommend it  especially at the current price and shipping deal  i liked the hair dryer  it s  1875w the same as my old hair dryer but the air seems to come out with more force  it s not too heavy which is good because i m a weakling  the cord is long enough  it s easy to hold and dries hair very quickly  the only problem for me was the switches on the side instead of in the front because they were right where i hold the dryer and i was accidentely hitting them the whole time changing the setting which was very annoying  overall  it was a good powerful hair dryer if you are able to deal with the switch placement  this hair dryer is much smaller than i expected   the smaller size makes using the nozzles much easier for those of us that don t have chimpanzee arms   the machine is also really quiet and efficient  i love how this hairdryer is so powerful without being heavy  but i seem to have a problem with the heating coil  it turns a bright red and starts smelling like its burning within 2 minutes of use  all i need is a basic hair dryer with several heat settings   this one suits my needs perfectly   reasonable price for a good product  this is a good addition to a bath room  especially for short to medium length hair haven t tried it on very long hair not too noisy  easy to handle  plenty of drying power e z mounting to wall   bargain at this price  this dryer gets way to hot  it over heats and burns your hair  i am still waiting for my hair to grow back  it is very good fan for the price  i noticed a tremendous difference in my hair even with the summer among us  the only thing that is a con is that it is not a light weight fan  otherwise i am extremely happy with my purchase  i have long  thick  curly hair and was researching good dryers   i was willing to pay more money if the product was worth it   i read several reviews here of people saying they have tried the t3 and that this dryer is better  so i bought this one for  32   after using it once i am so happy with it   it dried my hair in about 7 minutes  which is about half the time of my old dryer  which wasn t even a bad dryer to begin with    my hair came out looking so much smoother and more tame  and as a result i spent less time with the flat iron   i have the companion remington t studio 2 1 4 flat iron   asin b001lf4g4y remington s 9400 tstudio collection digital ceramic hair straightener with tourmaline 2 1 4 wide plates    and love it just as much   between the two items  and a little macadamia nut oil  i finish my long  difficult hair in about 15 minutes  and it s smoother than ever  and even holds better in the humidity   it s amazing  i can t see any reason to spend more  i rarely write reviews  but i wanted to warn others of my experience which seems to be very common with this hair dryer   there are not many wall mount hair dryers to pick from  and i mostly liked this one while it worked   bright night light  can be good or bad   i liked it   nice physical design  and decent power   i thought the air volume still did not compete with most  15 standard dryers  but if you are not looking for big air volume  it is fine  my wife misses a cold button   so in all  a mediocre hair dryer but with great wall mount convenience and bright night light   now with the issues    bought 18 months ago  worked fine except overheated very easily  if used on high  it would run as long as you want till you shut it off  then the internal temperature would apparently overheat with no more airflow  and would refuse to turn back on for 5 minutes or so   annoying  but i got used to it by going to medium heat for about 10 seconds before shutting it off every time   that seemed to cool it down just enough not to trigger the temperature limiter in case i needed to turn it back on right away   i probably would have pitched it  but i liked the wall mount convenience and put 4 holes in my wall to mount it   well  here we are 18 months of life  and now it is completely dead  night light on but the hair dryer is not home  i am electrically capable and could probably open up and fix this thing  but it is not worth the safety concern   if you want to pay a premium for wall mount  just know you might only get a year or two out of it   others seems to have similar experiences   sad that the  10 hand held models seem to last much longer   anyway  to cover up the holes in the walls  i am trying one of the other few wall mount options out there by another manufacturer  if this one dies  i am giving up on wall mount   good luck    hair dryers should not take this much thought  the conair ts127 travel smart mini hair dryer is not as small as i thought   be sure to read the dimension   the handle of the blow dryer folds down which is good if you need to conform to a space within your luggage   the high speed option on the dryer is powerful and it does dry hair quickly   i do wish there was a low  medium  and high option   overall i am satified with the purchase since i only travel 2 3 times a year  this is the second one of this model my wife owned   the blower fan severed off the spindal on the last one we had   hopefully  it won t happen again   regardless  we were very happy with the price on amazon   the items was over  80 dollars in the salon when she bought it about a year ago   the dryer appears to be very heavy duty and good enough to be used at the hair salons  i came across this while staying at a best western  it impressed me there immediately  i love how this little guy packs a big punch in a little package  i wanted something that isn t monstrous and a labor to hold up to use  also it doesn t take up much wall real estate  a big plus   the night light is a neat feature and won t create a distracting moon glow that will bleed into the bedroom  it also doesn t demand any quirky requirement to place it back in its mount  it easily snaps right back in without any trouble unlike you find with some cordless tool mounts  this dryer is perfect for those with medium to short length cuts  if you have a 3 foot long mane of thick  beautiful hair or a maybe pile of the dredds  forget this one  that s not the intention  wall mount is very convenient and appealing for guests  the price is good  it s easy to install and is quite functional  i purchased this dryer for a trip to italy   it worked perfectly   it has a switch so i can use it in either the usa or when i travel abroad   please note the directions read to only use on low setting when overseas  but the air volumne was still very good   i have thick hair   you will need an adaptor for it for international travel  but not a convertor   overall very good product  lightweight and durable  i needed to replace my conair wall mount hair dryer since the tab that helps hold the dryer on the wall broke off   so fortunately i found this beauty which matches nicely with my black and oil rubbed bronze fixtures in my bathroom   i like the led light also as it makes the bathroom feel very modern  i loved the idea of a hair dryer with a retractable cord  and i have always had success with conair in the past  so i was so disappointed when i started using the cord keeper and found it was just too loud to use   i literally had to put my finger in my left ear to keep it from crackling when i used this dryer   i mentioned that i had to take a hair dryer back to the store when my son and daughter in law were visiting  and they said they had a hair dryer that was too loud too   it turns out it was the same model  very good  love the ionic feature   it dries your hair fast and prevents frizziness  also a very good price  br    br   only downside is the handle can be difficult to grab without hitting the switches  there is one relatively small opening in between the two switches  temperature switch   power switch  for one finger to grasp  sometimes results in accidentally hitting the switches  but other than that it is great  i use this dryer exclusively for when i color my hair with a henna because henna is heat activated   so i do not use rollers but just put the bonnet on after applying the henna   not sure why the byline says from a 12 year old reader       the high setting does a great job activating the henna  but the bonnet is so heavy that it collapses on top of my head and is so hot that it would burn if i did not hold it up manually   except since the bonnet gets too hot to touch  i attach a clothespin to it and hold the clothespin up for the 50 minutes that the henna is cooking     it may work better with rollers  but the best idea would be to make a lighter bonnet that puffs up on its own  like the one that came with the old carel dryers     when i called the manufacturer to tell them that the bonnet acts that way  they were defensive   if they could fix that problem  they d have a much better dryer  my grandson and i both use this as a leave in conditioner   i have thin  light  bone straight hair and he has thick  full  stand up in the air hair and it works for both of us  particularly him   with it  his hair is more manageable  shiny and healthy looking and mine doesn t float around so much   we ve been using it for several years  this is the best flat iron period       i have used t3 over  200  ghd nearly  300  they work  but for  39 99 the best i have ever used   buy this one don t waste your money on the other brands  just got this and charged it overnight   used it with extreme satisfaction this morning   my teeth feel great   set up was a breeze and using it is easy   everything i hoped it would be  after getting a couple shellac manicures i decided to invest in my own home manicure set up and this light works great for doing your own nails  fits one hand or foot just fine and has 2 3 5 minute timers  i won t go past 2 minutes so don t see a need for the other two really  item was packaged well  with all 4 light bulbs  very easy to install the light bulbs and wa lah   good to go  i just could not see spending over  150 on one of these lights for home use so bought this one  it works the same as the one at my local salon with one exception   no fan  maybe that s the additional cost of the higher priced one and someday i may decide to spend that kind of money  but for a 2 minute curing this light is great  if you are into the new gel or shellac style manicures to grow your own nails long and strong it s worth the investment  you ll spend the same amount of money in 2 3 months as you will on setting up your own home manicure kit  i do feel bad for my manicurist so i ll probably still go see her for pedicures  this is by far a classic fragrance from polo   polo sport  still going strong a great classic must have from the 90 s  summery  this product is great when used for intended purpose  however its cheap construction means it has a limited life span     pros        it is gentle and easy to use on very hard to reach places      cons        after about 2 years of use the button broke  stuck in the depressed position  meaning i can no longer turn the thing on        its great for soft body hair  not great for anything above the neck      review  initially this seemed like a great purchase  it shaves reasonably close but at no danger of nicking the skin no matter what awkward angle you use  it seems simple and sturdy and easy to clean  no one wants details as to where and how this product was used  but i will say if you re hoping for a multitasking razor this isn t it  i would occasionally use this guy to trim my beard when i had one  and it worked okay  but sometimes snag the larger hairs  needed multiple passes  etc  this isn t a big deal  i think you need the right tools for the job and prefer this being a good body hair trim and sub par beard trimmer than having something that was average at both      what really lost stars was the product s history of breaking through no fault of the user  unfortunately  even though it feels pretty sturdy and reliable it will end up breaking  now i know nothing last forever  but i think for an electronics device that costs  40 that one only gently uses for a few minutes every week  it should be functional or repairable for more than a couple years      sadly norelco is the only company that makes body hair razors that seem to work well  so i replaced my broken trimmer with a more expensive one hoping it lasts longer  i don t feel good  though  about endorsing norelco with a repeat purchase  arrived in good condition  i ve only used the product for about 2 weeks  i haven t noticed any changes in my skin yet  i m using this as recommended in conjunction with the acquarella nail polish  it works as a clear polish  as well     the best thing about it is that it does not trigger contact dermatitis or cause nail pitting like the drug store stuff  so i m excited about that  at first i didnt like the way they went on   they kind of slipped around when placing them  but the stayed once they were in place  the stayed  after a few times of usage i did see some results  my teeth are whiter but next time i will purchase a stronger method i have used mentadent ever since it came on the market  i always liked the way it was packaged  in a pump  rather than a tube  and liked the flavor of the product  i always thought that it was doing a great job cleaning and protecting my teeth and eliminating tartar  and my feelings were validated when my dentist asked me how come you don t have any tartar this time    i had been using mentadent for approx  8 months at that point   i told him what i was using and he just sort of nodded and said well  something is working   at my next checkup it was the same story   little to no tartar  he could not believe it and remarked that it was also whitening my teeth   1 shade whiter in about a year of use   mentadent contains peroxide   a couple of years ago i added a sonicare toothbrush to my arsenal and since then my teeth have gotten 2 more shades whiter   i could not be more pleased with mentadent and i was thrilled to find it on amazon for such a great price   i immediately signed up for automatic shipments of 6 refills at a time  as i am no longer able to find it in my local stores   i have stocked up from amazon  bought 18 refills in may 2011  and will continue to do so at every  opportunity as i dont  ever want to do with out my mentadent    o     update   may 2011  i am so bummed  and actually a little angry  that amazon has suddenly decided to drop the subscribe   save option on the advanced cleaning formula mentadent that i had been buying from them for years    o   they tried to be helpful and suggested that i replace this s s item with an advanced whitening item of a similar price  this will not work for me as after 2 wks of use the advanced whitening makes my teeth very sensitive  seriously  if they want to be helpful and show that they appreciate all the years that i have been a loyal customer of this and many other items from them they should reinstate the s s option for the advanced cleaning formula that they still carry    o     what s next  suddenlythey won t even offer this formula of mentadent at all   o  hey guys  i have to tell ya  i have tried many nose ear trimmers  but by far the philps norelco nt9110 is the best i have ever used or bought  this philps norelco 9110 is absolutely the best  if you follow the instructions  rinse and brush it out after  every use  this product will last  who knows how long  i have had mine for 2 months now  and not a problem with anything  it dose the job of trimming my nose ear hair better than what i exspected  all i can say is  you will not be disapointed with the performance  best regards  greg   p s  thanks a lot phillps for making an exceptional product  if you want quality foundation you re going to have to pay for it  i bouught a physician s formula foundation and wow  what crap that was  their sponge they sell with the compact won t even fit in their compact           but this gabriel compact is great  the foundation is superb  i purchased this soap due to the reviews on youtube  it s a good cleanser but im not sure if ill be re purchasing  i think the black soap in solid form from coastal scents performs much better  this one smells like cigarette ash which really grosses me out  won t leave your skin smelling like it though  so don t worry  doesnt smoothen the skin as much as i thought it would  but it does leave a nice clean feeling and smoothens the skin more then most cleansers out there  this sponge arrived sooner than expected and as described  in brand new condition  this is an amazing product and i will be purchasing again  this is the only perfume that i love   luckily  even though it s off the market for years  amazon is still selling the inventory  i have tried several of the 100  pure lotions   one common theme is that they all have a pretty strong scent   this vanilla scent to me was completely overpowering   very  very strong   too much so though  br    br   as far as the lotion  it really is one of the few that is totally pure   i love that   but the lotion itself for me doesn t work as well as others   it s fairly runny  and doesn t moisturize my skin very well   i will not be purchasing this brand anymore because of that  i have used quantum for over 20 years   through all it s changes   i have tried numerous other kind but always return to quantum because it is the only one that  can handle my difficult hair  it is a great product  product is nothing special  especially since most kids shampoos are tear free i was disappointed to find that it burned my 6 month old sons eyes   boo hoo   will not purchase again this is a really nice mild smelling body wash that certainly does wonders for dry skin  love it  ordered it twice esp  at ths sale price  great pick for servicing scuba gear   use it for removing o rings   strong  not really bendable  which is good  this is really worth everything it stands for  no wonder it is a classic  it is incredible  i never bought a perfume without smelling it before this one  my god i did not regret it  this was absolutely amazing  with items like this  i think most of us are creatures of habit and prefer to use what we re used to using  if it s worked well for 45 years  that s a pretty good recommendation   that s how i feel about these revlon tweezers  mine   which i ve really had for about 45 years  i think  mysteriously disappeared recently   someday they ll probably just as mysteriously reappear   in the meantime  i couldn t find a replacement  have never been able to use the flat edged ones  and was reluctant to spend a lot of money on expensive tweezers that get somewhat mixed reviews   since the latter two categories were the only types i could find in my local stores  i was glad to find the revlon tweezers here   and you know what  as i m sitting here typing this  it occurs to me that  now that i know these are the real deal  i d be a fool not to go ahead and order another pair  while they re still available  just in case my new ones disappear anytime within the next 45 years   i think i ll do that  love the aroma of this little stick of perfume   so clean  a touch of lemon and easy to carry anywhere  this was so cheap but the product is not   excellent quality    love it and use it a lot  i m no hairdresser but to me these clippers feel like a professional set  they re heavy and sturdy and powerful  they have a thick  no nonsense cord  just sturdy  oh  and they cut hair really well too  no more catching  i d recommend these for sure  i have curly african american 3c hair that is prone to breakage  tangling  brittleness and snapping  this makes my hair easily detangle  smells like gardenia flowers  it is a tan color with a creamy  buttery texture  it doesn t exactly make hair shine  but is great for a leave in conditioner and makes hair even curlier  i liked the price for the amount that you get of 7oz  it doesn t weigh hair down and is not oily  this is perfect for any ethnic hair type or wavy curly hair for non ethnic hair  when i put it on my hair i instantly noticed the difference  i love this and plan to buy it for as long as they make the product  what a great product  there is a little learning curve  but really application just takes a little time  you can cut the strips in half and get two applications  the most important thing to remember is to rub  rub  rub the shield on your nail  i do it while watching tv  great longevity  my nails out grew the shield  made my nails grow super fast and they are really strong  be patient  you will be glad you did  while us pediatricians strongly urge parents to leave the earwax removal to professionals  people in asia do this all the time  i was able to see the earwax with the light and gently scoop out the canal   the big scoop and the tweezers were too big for his 9 year old ears but the smaller scoop worked perfectly  br    br   warning  do not try this on yourself or go too deeply in the canal   it s long enough to do some real damage  this is such a great product  it is easy to apply and it does much for my lashes  no more fake lashes for me  lash extensions does it    there is no other cleanser that compares to this one   its worth the price  it leaves your face feeling clean and moisturized   no dry feeling here  if you ask me this product doesn t work much different than the redken full frame 07 protective volumizing mousse   the mousse works better than the lotion it never makes your hair flat not even in the back   i even tried a reviewer s tips and it didn t make a difference  i have fine hair   i ll continue to use it because it makes my hair soft  it works but i always end up having a sore throat the next morning   br    br   maybe because i swallow some but hey  it works and cheap i just recieved this unit today in the mail and it looks and feels so natural    most wigs and lacefronts have a very shiny and unreal look when you get them but this one looks exactly like relaxed african american hair  i ordered two in the color 1 but will def be ordering more in another color soon    ladies if you re thinking of getting this unit to use as a protective style or just to change up your look     you def won t be disappointed     inexpensive product that made my hair very smooth for flat ironing  i highly recommend  loved it   i am going to order it again   if you order  buy two  it s not very big and you certainly don t want to run out since you will be instantly hooked  while this product does do what it claims as far as brassiness goes  it turned out way darker than the medium brown on the box   my hair was a light medium reddish brown before and now it s dark brown   luckily  it was a pleasant surprise for me   maybe not so much for the next gal    i was really impressed with the amount of rhinestones i got and the colors on the picture here  don t do it justice  they are so much brighter and gorgeous  love it and totally worth the money    the picture shows an 8 oz bottle and 5 oz toothpaste  at that size it d be a good deal  what you actually receive is a 3 4 oz bottle and a teeny tiny bottle of toothpaste   lost it on vacation  so can t post actual size   the actual product is good  but don t buy this version of it  this is a really fabulous red sparkle polish   it s a good product and i treated myself        it s a bit hard to take off  but most sparkle polishes are   as much as i like the product  i do feel it is a bit over priced  especially when you add shipping     if i was to come across this brand again  in store  i would buy it  if it was a color i had to have  love these cleansing pads   great for travel and so calming to the skin   asin b001mbr4u0 apivita cleansing tissues with chamomile 10x0 16 oz    it works  just like the one it replaced   first time charging is quite slow  so be prepared   also the rubber coating on the last one of these i bought discolored quickly  and the one before that the coating became sticky after a while   i am hoping this third one is better  i have this iron and love it   it is a professional quality iron which straightens and creates beautiful curls  br    br   there is some confusion aboutt he button

power and i love that it came with attachments  a must have  i read numerous reviews on hair dryers and picked this one  it s easy to hold because of the rubberized grip  excellent selection of heat and speed settings which are simple to control on the handle  i have fairly straight hair and it leaves my hair soft and shiny  hopefully it will last several years  no other hair dryer could touch the amazing job that this one does in half the time with no frizz  love it  this might just be the worst hair dryer i have ever tried  i have curly hair that i usually blow dry straight  no problem  but with this one i could not get it straight   ended up just resigning myself to using my flat iron on the still damp but very frizzy fried mess i ended up with  as another reviewer commented  you have to destroy the packaging to get it out  but i am going to do my best to get it back in there   sealed up to return as this was just a waste of money  an extra star for the retractable cord though  that would have been great had this been a dryer i could tolerate  i don t blow dry my hair everyday  so it hasn t gotten a good solid workout like ones i ve used in the past   that being said  i do like this hairdryer   it is easy to travel with and doesn t weigh a ton   can easily hold it with one hand without your wrist tiring  while the other hand is styling with a brush   the retractable cord is still working although at times it takes several tries to get it to completely retract now   worked very well when i first received it  only started having trouble with that part over the past several months   the control is a single control where the heat setting and volume of air setting are the same  low air flow and cooler air  highest air flow with highest heat   if you want separate air flow and heat settings  this isn t the dryer for you  i love the look of this dryer  the red is so cool   and it has a more reasonable airflow than most of the dryers i ve tried   i don t need that much force  just enough to get my hair dry   it also lets you pick from several different combos of heat air flow force   the only con is that it weighs more than my previous dryer    but not enough to make me send it back   overall  i m pleased with this purchase  i had seen these before in various hotels motels  last week i asked the maintenance person at the place d armes about these units  and was told that they were very reliable  my favorite criteria  br    br   i ordered two on 2 day prime shipping and received them the very next day  they are unbelievably easy to install  and work flawlessly  no more dryers on the lavatory with the cords catching on the cabinet knobs  br    br   two thumbs up  i am so glad amazon had this product  it is a fabulous hair dryer  i have one upstairs and one in my downstairs bathroom  we used it in a hotel and liked it so we bought 2 from amazon  various wind speed   the air is never too hot  the wind is never too powerful  it dries your hair quickly   light weight  foldable handle plus retractable cord make it easy to travel   i paid  20 out the door with amazon prime  it s better than dryers that are much more expensive   now we ll just have to see how long they last  i have very thick and corse   curly wavy hair and i love this hair dryer   it s nice and compact but has a lot of power  it dries my hair in half the time it used to with other bigger  more expensive dryers  i first used this in a hotel i stayed at and came on here the minute i got home to order it  for me  it s been so worth it  love this   this blow dryer has two settings    hurricane or puff of breath  not much in between  it s great for getting your hair dry in a hurry  but if you re used to styling with a blow dryer it presents a bit of a challenge  it is fairly light  which is why i bought it  overall  it is ok  however  it is a little heavier than my other hair dryers   but it dries hair very quickly the different heat settings work nicely   dryer is comfortable to hold and is powerful hot enough that i can hold it 6 8 inches from my head and it will still dry my hair effectively   my only problem with the hair dryer is that it is somewhat too powerful to use the diffuser if i want to dry my naturally curly hair into curls   even on the low power setting  it blows my hair to hard and the curls go all over the place and don t form nicely   if i want to have curly hair for the day  i use one of my other  less powerful dryers   works great for my straight hair days  though  i have had this product for a month and a half it it has worked wonderfully every morning  not too loud  not scorching hot  dryes hair quickly  and i love the portability  i the retractor need a little help by pushing the cord in a bit at times and it easily snaps to fold  fits great in my small drawer in the bathroom  the last blow dryer we bought cost almost  100 00  when it broke i headed my wife off and purchased this one from amazon and my wife said it was as good as the  100 00 one we had  the dryer was great for about 3 weeks   it was easy to install and had tons of power   it dried my hair faster than my old dryer and was extremely light weight  however  it died   i was drying my hair and it looked like something was on fire inside and about 30 seconds later it shot a streak of fire out and quit   the heat source still works but the motor won t   i am really disappointed with this purchase  i initially purchased this to use as a travel blow dryer  mainly for the gym   it turns out  that it works better than the one i keep at home  i have fairly thick hair  and it s gone from chin length to an inch or so below my shoulders since i bought it      pros    dries my hair very quickly   retractable cord is awesome  don t need to deal with winding it around the dryer    folding handle is awesome as well  takes up less space when storing    not bulky     cons    very heavy  and thus not very portable which defeats my intended purpose i bought this dryer to replace my conair nano silver tourmaline  which i loved dearly   i ve tried a number of other conair dryers  and none of them got quite hot enough  so i figured i d give this one a try     my hair  mid back  quite thick  wavy curly and frizz prone   i usually dry it straight with a round brush instead of flat ironing  so i need a dryer that gets very hot     things i like about the dryer     1  great heat settings   my old dryer went from hot to scalding   this one blows truly cold air for the cool shot  cool air on low  warm on warm  and scalding on hot   i was surprised by how well it dried my hair on warm  i usually use the highest setting the whole time   but i did need to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight   this dryer gets hotter than anything i ve tried in this price range  which for me is a huge plus     2  relatively quiet   it sounds like a hair dryer  but is considerably quieter than any other product i ve tried       3  good weight feel   other reviewers have said it s heavy  but at least compared to the other conair dryers i ve used  i d say it s about the same  maybe lighter   definitely not a problem unless you re used to a really  really lightweight dryer   the surface is nice and grippy  and the balance feels good     overall  i m very satisfied   it dried my hair quickly  can attain the heat i need  but doesn t limit you to scaldingly hot   and didn t cost an arm and a leg   highly recommended  amazon was very responsive  but the manufacturer did not mail out the product to my home in an appropriate amount of time  the distributor had to be prodded by amazon to fulfill my request  the product is just perfect for my wife  but the delay was not pleasant  my wife loves this hairdryer  it has multiple speeds and settings and even the hot setting doesn t get too hot for her  it s lightweight and not too big  still easy to travel with also  have used this hair dryer for more than 2 weeks  it works pretty well  it has enough heat for the different settings  it seems to have less statics compare to my old hair dryer  this blowdryer is excellent    it can handle my lion s mane of hair  it is light to hold  easy to  hold and use and high quality construction   the fekkai salon on 5th avenue nyc uses these dryers which is why i ordered it  i will note that the cord is surprisingly thick and heavy compared to other regular retail store blow dryers  but it provides a generous length  i love everything about this dryer except the low speed while on hot is not hot enough  it feels like it s blowing cool air  this hair dryer works great   my hair is dry in no time at all   can t beat the price either  i have thin  fine hair and need to heat   rapidly cool the roots while back brushing to get lift and fullness   i had the previous model of this blow dryer and it worked very well for this purpose   unfortunately  after about a year the blower switch broke right in half   i bought this one to replace it   i like that the dryer is reasonably priced so i didn t feel too ripped off at having to buy a new one   this one has a couple of manufacturing changes  though  that i felt were downgrades  first and foremost  this one has a 6  cord  where the previous model had a 9  cord   the cord doesn t swivel  so the extra length gave me more flexibility in movement  whereas this one makes the dryer seem cheap   second  remington changed the direction of the blower switch  rather arbitrarily  so that up is now off instead of high   i know this sounds petty  but that change removed the automaticity of my hand movements completely and i couldn t see a good reason to change it   it probably won t be a problem for you if you didn t have the earlier model     the drawback to the original  which is still a drawback on the current model  is that it has so much power even in the low setting that when i m back brushing i don t have good control over the hair   on the earlier model i felt this was still workable and if you want lots of blow power this model definitely fits the bill     i ended up coming across a babyliss pro porcelain ceramic that i could try before buying  and even though it cost more i bought it anyway and am keeping this one as my spare   it has the longer cord  heat and blower controls and while it has plenty of power it doesn t blow quite as hard on the low blower setting   since i was having to re learn the controls on the t studio anyway  i figured i might as well get a longer cord out of the deal  for  19 99 this is one of the best buys out there   wall mounted the cord and dryer are out of the way and off the counter   only 1600 watts but dries better then our bigger old one   small  compact and you can take it with you when traveling  works great  dries my hair with no problem and my hair isn t as frizzy as it usually is when i blow dry it  haven t had any problems with it after the month i ve had it     i was able to get this directly from amazon for  20   i give it 5 stars because i think it is a great hair dryer overall for my purposes  and excellent also for the price       i don t use this for travel but really like the retractable cord   actually i don t bother retracting it  but like the fact that i can keep just a relatively short but usable length of cord out all the time  which doesn t clutter up the counter   with every other hair dryer i have ever had the cord was way too long and got in the way   this hair dryer wouldn t be my first choice for travel  by the way  because it is a bit big and heavy as compared to other travel hair dryers     at the maximum speed the airflow is probably less than most other dryers  but is sufficient for me   another potential negative for some people might be the larger than normal handle circumference  but you get used to it  and for me this size is actually perfect     another surprise regarding this hair dryer is that my hair is more shiny now  it must be the ceramic or ionic thing   being ceramic it is supposed to have more even heat  which is less likely to damage your hair   whatever is causing this effect  i like it  and was noticeable right away     lastly i am guessing this will last a while  given the 5 year warranty   i previously was using another  20 hair dryer purchased at a local store  and they lasted an average of 6 months before breaking   this one seems like it will last  and i won t have any issues with the cord retraction mechanism possibly wearing out since i never change the cord length  we bought this hair dryer in oct  of 2009 and it stopped working in may of 2011  up to that point it had worked ok   it is small and loud and did not dry as well as a normal size hair dryer   we would not buy this product again  i have purchased 3 of these hair dryers and the last 2 have not been satisfactory   my daughter has the original one and it s still going   i however  purchased one the same time she did and it just wasn t putting out the amount of air it did in the past   so i replaced it with another one and it s only been months and it doesn t get as hot as it used to   very frustrating to pay so much for a dryer and not have it perform  got this for my daughter for christmas who lives in another state and she loves it   thanks for all your good products  we wanted a wall mounted dryer that would fit a narrow space and give us the power for drying male and female hair  this was perfect  and it looks good  too  only suggestion would be to add a cool setting along with its high and low heat setting  we would recommend this dryer for space savings  convenience  and good looks  this hairdryer was exactly what i was looking for   a simple design that blows forcefully   it works quickly and my hair looks smooth when i am done   the hottest setting gets a little too hot if you leave the dryer pointed at your scalp for more than a few seconds  but that s really a pro because it gets good and hot   it has three heat settings to adjust for comfort  after reading mixed reviews on this product i decided to take a chance since the price seemed good   upon reciept i plugged it in and the element overheated immediately   the fan did not work and smoke started coming out of it   needless to say  after a long cool down it went back in the box and was returned   amazon was great refunding my money as i certainly didn t want a replacement   how it got a ul rating i ll never know   i suggest spending a few more bucks and getting a quality item  i suggest you don t waste your cash on those expensive hair dryers when you can buy this one   it comes in the ceramic tourmaline design that is popular now  but more importantly  this dryer s wattage is much higher than most hair dryers out there  and i ve looked     the higher the wattage  the more air it can move around   and that means faster dry times   i ve only used this a couple of times  so i don t know how long it will last   so far  so good  i got the first one good so i order the second one i m happy with it it s very organized my kid love it too  this is great   used them in hotels in the past   convenient  always know where it is and it works great  i absolutely love this hair dryer  it makes my hair so shiny and soft  and it feels incredibly smooth  with other hair dryers  my hair would look fried  frizzy  and extremely coarse  no matter what products i used  not with this one  it has a decent amount of settings available  temperature settings are hot and warm and speed settings are low and high  the cool shot button is great for locking in the shine and shape in my hairstyle  it s easy to use this hair dryer  and it s not so heavy  which is nice  i am seriously impressed  next to laundry  blow drying my hair is my least favorite thing to do   i was looking for something that would blow dry my hair fast   i have very fine hair  longer than shoulder length  the first day i used this blow dryer i had it on medium heat and it took 10 minutes  that is how long my old blow dryer took  but my hair looked much healthier than with other blow dryers  the next day i used it  i set it to hot and it took only 5 minutes   it still looked great  just as healthy   my hair is always breaking and when i blow dry  normally the damage is very apparent   with this blow dryer my hair looks smooth and shiny   i love this blow dryer   i highly recommended it   i already owned this blow dryer  but purchased a second one for travel  i really like this dryer for it s ease of use  temperature and air settings   i like that the operating buttons are a slide up and down  this is a great feature since you don t accidentally turn the blow dryer off or change the settings while you are drying your hair  like other dryers with elevated buttons  i have a lot of hair and it s thick and this blow dryer  drys it very quickly  the heat is not overly hot  it s just right  the lower settings are perfect for styling  the dryer is also light weight  the price is lower than anywhere else and it arrived quickly and no shipping  i ordered and received my merchandise exactly as promised  no muse and no fuse  just a perfect buying experience  i would recommend this vendor  wow   so lightweight  it s unbelievably efficient  if it only had a cool setting it would be perfect  br   still   it comes close  great price  this is an awesome dryer  my hair stylist recommended it as it is the same line used in her salon   very effective and cuts down the time required for drying in half   could never go back now that i know what a better dryer feels like  i first found this hair dryer while staying at mariott hotel and loved it   i always bring my own with me on trips but this time i never used it   great power yet small and with the retractable cord very easy to store  this is a great little hair dryer  i wanted a hair dryer to use for both home   travel and the size is perfect  i bought this dryer about a year ago at target becuase i was looking for a dryer with a diffuser   the first time i tried it  it was very difficult to turn on becuase of the flat switches  which are pretty stiff  and the texture they have on them doesn t help you grip them at all   and it takes forever to dry your hair with it becuase it doesn t seem to get all that hot   the folding handle and retractable cord work just fine  very nice for storage  and yes the cord doesn t really fully retract after the first time you use it  you re left with about 2 inches of cord sticking out   i definitely would not recommend this hair dryer  the only reason i can t bring myself to throw it out is because it technically still works and i ll at least have some hair dryer in case my good one breaks  i used this type of dryer at my brother s house and recall it feeling powerful and pretty hot  even at a low setting   exactly what i was looking for in a new dryer     then i ordered one for myself and got a fairly crappy dryer that didn t get warm enough at a low speed setting and didn t feel powerful at all    my only impression is disappointment  i would not recommend this dryer for anyone looking for a quality dryer  i have super long fine hair and this didn t do it for me  it actually made my hair feel sticky  for lack of a better word  it is much louder than any other dryer i ve used and it didn t come with the concentrator as advertised    i ll be sending it back  after years of having a long magnificent mane   i decided that perhaps the bare minimum for the curls wasn t enough  i love this hair dryer   i have nearly more long  curly hair than shakira herself   and this dryer does the job very well on the low setting and quickly  i recommend the tresemme flawless curls defining gel if you have thick curly hair and need a great dryer with a fantastic diffuser  the salon quality at an affordable price with a solid diffuser that wouldn t lose grip on the dryer is what i sought  and it s exactly what i got  this is a great hairdryer  i have a full sized one for home and it dries my hair in less than 2 minutes and i have long hair  it leaves hair smooth and silky and has not damaged it at all  i bought this one to put in my gym bag and i was worried that it wouldn t work as well as the full sized version  i highly recommend this hair dryer  this is the second conair silver bird hair dryer that i have purchased   i like it very much  except that its a bit heavy   it works great and is powerful enough to dry any hair type  great blowdryer for the price  has three settings  is definitley an improvement over my old dryer  im not sure if this gets as hot as i would like  but for the price  i am very satisfied  love how lightweight   compact this blow dryer is   air concentration is great due to style shape of the nozzle   easy to travel with   drys great   it is more powerful   drys better than other higher watt blow dryers i ve owned in the past   would highly recommend this product    already have   i had one of them for more than 14 years but because it was quite old start acting funny  still work  but sometimes didn t want to turn off  so  i bought an expensive one from a retail store and it was junk  i change that blow dryer twice in a year   then i decide to look here to see if i find my turbo dryer and lucky enough i did   i love this blow dryer is the best  i have long hair and i like my hair super straight and the turbo 1500 do the magic super easy  i ordered this on amazon from elephant deals  i received it quickly  the blower is fantastic  it has a steady  hot flow  it doesn t leave me with flyaways  and i don t have to use a flat iron when i m done  it is quick and efficient  i highly recommend this blower  as i had minimal space on our bathroom  counter i needed a hair dryer that could hang out of the way   i was able to attach it to the inside of the cabinet door below   thus it is out of sight when not in use and very available when needed   as far as the function of the dryer  it lives up to my expectations  this replaced my old wall hairdryer  i love the design and the night light is very nice to have  very quiet when running and i have the option of changing from 1200w to 1600w  i would recommend this hairdryer  i purchased this blackbird in december of 2006 and now in april of 2011 smoke started coming out of the on off switch  so i got a good 4 years out of it     in this day and age when this product like others offer no warranty time at all i quess thats pretty good  overall  love the dryer  i do wish there was a hook for hanging and ultimately would love to see a medium heat setting  the dryer really does make my hair shine  good deal for the cost and the retractable cord is a a lifesaver  i bought this hair dryer when i decided to replace my still working  but not doing the best job  conair  i am a sucker for anything different  and this fit the bill  i washed my hair right after i bought it so i could check it out  after using it all i could think of were these three words  no me gusta  i didn t even finish drying my hair with it  my conair takes me 5 minutes tops to dry my thick  shoulder length hair  i was on 20 minutes with this one and i had had enough  also  it kept sucking my hair into the vents which was rather painful  this hair dryer is severely lacking oomph  it takes me less time to dry my hair with my old conair and style separately then it would have taken me to style and dry with this thing      i am returning it tomorrow and i ll buy a regular blow dryer      once again  no me gusta  this is my third t3   the special edition comes with a shorter cord   this is fine for home use  in fact  it might be better not having and 8 ft cord   this blow dryer is the best i have ever used and the price is less that inferior dryers  my hair is so soft and it was so worth the money  i recommend it for anyone  also great gift idea    update i have had this item since 2011 and its still going strong  nice quality  you get what you pay for  it s efficient and the temperature options as nice  i use the diffuser all the time for my curly hair to avoid frizzing and it locks on nicely  also  the diffuser is nicely shaped so you can get it right on your scalp because it is curved  and it won t fall off all the time like it might with another brand  make sure you don t click the blue button unless you want it locked on the cold temperature    i almost thought i had a defective product because i didn t know i had clicked it by accident  otherwise it s working great so far  so i hadn t updated my hair dryer in years  think 15   so i was really thrilled to receive this one  i would highly recommend it    br    br   pros  br   doesn t die on me when i am using it  overheating   this is a big one for me  i have very long hair and it seems every blower would take a water break halfway through because it was being worked too much  not this one  br    br   nice  modern look  love the spunky metallic green color  not gaudy at all  br    br   small  lightweight size   much smaller than the older one i had  and not nearly as heavy  your hand won t fall off after using it     br    br   usable attachment   i wasn t aware when i bought this  but it has an attachment on the end to focus the heat for styling  since i have hair that curves in and frames the face  this is perfect for getting that look   i only have to go over it once in order for it to be perfect  br    br   hot and cold   the cold is actually not hot  yes  it s not hot  amazing  lol  and the hot doesn t burn your eyelashes off   perfect in either setting  even the cooler version actually still dries your hair well  br    br   negatives  none that i can think of  br    br   overall  i highly recommend it  great blow dryer  my 10 year old conair just died so i bought this model   so far it has been perfect   the airflow is great   i love the temperature settings with the cool shot   i mainly use the straightening attachment which is perfect   this works just as well as the  150 ones at the salon  i have owned a t3 hairdryer for over 7 years now   the first model i owned was the evolution model   300 retail  and used it for 5 years   i still have it and it works   i replaced it with the feather weight model only because i had back surgery and the evolution was a little heavy to hold over the top of my head for any length of time  so i switched       the feather weight is an excellent hairdryer   my hair is extremely thick and curly   this dryer dries it from completely wet to dry  smooth and straight in 12 minutes and i have a lot of hair   i recommend using the attachment to concentrate the airflow exactly where you want it   i only take the attachment off when i want to simply blow the water out of my hair before styling it   then i put the attachment back on     don t hesitate   especially if you have unruly  curly  thick hair that takes a long time to dry   this one shortens the time  smooths the hair shaft  and straightens great   i also use john frieda products  especially the hairspray for curly hair  as well   the hairspray will keep your hair straight for one day   and that is a true fact  if you travel and would like to style your hair at your destination then the infinitipro by conair 1875 is for you   the foldable handle is perhaps the best invention since the invention of the blow dryer itself   when folded it fits into its own carrier bag   that bag fits easily in any suitcase or briefcase  or purse if you carry one    the portability of this styler should not fool you as you have a full 1875 watts   that s a lot of power to blow and to heat   i would highly recommend this styler   oh  and i forgot to mention that the color looks great  this hair dryer shaved 1 1 2 hours off my hair straightening time   i have curly  or better yet coily  hair and this hair dryer  with the comb attachment  goes through it like butter  i highly recommend this hair dryer  this hair dryer is powerful  it dries hair much faster than my old trusty dryer  the swivel handle can be folded so that the whole thing can go into a small tote for travel or storage  besides the standard high and low settings  it has a cool shot button to just dry hair without heat  it is very well built and has a very high quality feel to it  no wonder it is backed by a 4 year warranty     besides a tote bag  it comes with snap on concentrator for special styling needs     the metallic apple green color is just too hot  with its modern style setting look  it is just adorable  love it  this is my second andis hair dryer   i had the first one over six years but it was starting to wear out   i wanted to stay with this brand and this one is even better   lightweight and easy to hold   i like the three heat settings which the older one did not have   more important  styling is better and my hair really does feel silkier and looks shinier   i recommend this product  this review is for the remington ac2015 tstudio salon collection pearl ceramic hair dryer  the packaging of this product was nicely done and not too wasteful  but adequate enough to get the contents delivered without being broken or damaged  the product was easy to remove from the packaging  and the instructions for use were very straightforward and well written  the temperature controls and blower settings were intuitive  and the balance of heating and air movement seems to be very suitable  overall  i was very pleased with the quality of this product  when turned on this blow dryer sounds different than any other i have previously owned  it sound stronger  with a quieter engine hum  the color is very cool and i like the turn and fold handle  the cord is durable and the settings are nice  the warm setting is just right and i like the cool down set style setting  it is full size  but not overly big and thus it is easy to handle and not tiresome to use  highly recommend this blow dryer  do  not buy this dryer it will stop working in 3 months i used this dry proberbly 3 times in 3 months and it just stop working and  you have to have the recipt to return it is just not worth it plus the heat come from one direction and you have to move you head so that ever were can dry skip it theirs a reason its priced so cheap i ve used a blow dryer practically every day for the past 30 years so i consider myself a bit of an expert   this is one of the best blow dryers i ve used   it s light but powerful and does a great job   highly recommended  i like the hair dryer   it dries very well and the design is very modern and updated   it is adjustable and it get really hot with and  it has a ionic straightener that helps your hair dry you hair straight  after having used a wall mount sunbeam hairdryer on vacation last summer  i really wanted one for my bathroom   after researching many available on amazon and other websites  i chose the andis model because it offered the nighlight and a place for the cord  i ve been using it now for two months      since it was going to take up a permanent spot in my outlet  it having a nightlight was dead useful   i read other reviews saying that the nightlight was way too bright   my husband and i disagree  we love the amount of light put out by the hairdryer   it is signficantly brighter than our old nightlight which means you can get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and never have to turn on the overhead light   isn t that the point of a nightlight   maybe the people who dislike the amount of light have it in a master bath and don t close the door to the bathroom and it bothers them when they sleep  my solution would be to shut the bathroom door in that case     sorry that this turned into a review of the nightlight feature   the hairdryer gives you as 1400 or 1600 watt option and i use it on the 1600 because i have massively thick hair   it dries my hair quickly and is not obnoxiously loud   i like that it has a cord keeper and keeps everything tidy in my teeny bathroom   my husband had the hairdryer mounted on the wall in less than 10 minutes and that includes my running up and down the stairs for the right screwdriver     all in all  an excellent buy and i would purchase it again  bought this for my mom to try it out because her  150 dryer went out after 9years and she said it dryes almost as quickly as her old one but is super loud  and does not leave hair feeling or looking as smooth and shiny as her old one  you get what you  pay for  got this jerdon from amazon to replace an oster with the same wattage  this dryer seems to dry my hair a lot faster  but      when doing the sides  it sounds like a jet airplane   it is very noisy  but you don t have to have it on as long  so i guess it evens out the pros and the cons  i would recommend this to a friend  but  i would advise them about the loudness of the dryer   it is a good dryer for the cost and i am not sorry i bought it  i first saw this product at my hairdresser s salon while she was blowing drying my daughter s hair   this product was wonderful  it made her hair soft and light and dried her hair within minutes   it also straightens the hair which my daughter loves as her hair is natural   i also tried it on my relaxed hair and it did the same thing   awesome product  this product does justice to those who have thick  full hair to even silky fine hair  i have used several blow dryers and this one has help protect breakage  it s easy to use and to store  and eliminates me from oiling or heating my hair as much without it s ionic ceramic support  the heat and wattage combined helps keep my hair shiny  healthy and straight  less use of flat iron and pressing comb   i m a satisfied customer      i got this to replace another conair dryer that i loved   i wish they would stick with their old way of doing things instead of improving   it isn t as kind to my hair while drying and is too painful to my ears   am returning it  my wife with her beautiful long hair always uses a blow dryer after washing it  so this works perfect for the always have with you styler  it works great  looks great and the handle folds up nicely to make it compact  the lint catcher is detachable to easily clean off the lint and it also comes with a bag which helps keep the cord with the unit  excellent styler and works great on my short hair  too  i ve only had the product a short time and purchased it to install in my guest bathroom   i had a guest visiting from england for three weeks and she loved it  she said it was better than most she has encountered in 1st class hotels   i m surprised how quiet it is  i bought the silver colored version of this at target about 5 months ago   i was happy with it until last week   i straightened the collasable handle and heard a cracking sound   the handle would no longer stay straight when i used the machine   like some of the other reviewers i found  upon opening up the device  that the very cheap plastic piece that kept the handle in the locked position had broken   there was no way to fix it and it wasn t worth the hassle and expense to mail it in for repair   so i bought a different brand last night   i m very unhappy with this product  i have pretty frizzy hair  i get it chemically straightened  but still  when i blow dry it  it s frizzy   i need to flat iron it   i was amazed by this hair dryer   i used the comb attachment   after drying my hair it looked like it had already been flat ironed     it was straight   shiny   i would highly recommend this hair dryer to anyone with curly hair that wants it straight  i had a conair from years ago that was on its way out so i decided to buy another one  it is very efficient and powerful and i love the cord keeper feature  i thought the opening was a little larger  but other than that  so far so good  easy to install  easy to use  the noise  some people complain about  comes with the size  how do you expect to blow 1600w through such small opening  it suits my needs  i m giving 4 just because it s too early to make any conclusions regarding quality  i purchased two of these dryers  one for my daughter at college and one for at home   mine got everyday use  and it lasted almost 18 months   i liked its small size  making it easy to store and nice to pack when traveling  but it was very loud   i m sure that my hearing suffered from it s screaming airflow   it was working fine until a couple of days ago when something blew to pieces inside and it shattered to a stop   my daughter s is still working  but it only get used once and a while for travel  br   i would not recommend this dryer   my previous dryer  a conair  lasted over 7 years with daily use    sometimes even drying our long haired dog   br   i purchased a new  full sized conair 121wft turbo in hot pink  yesterday   it is so quiet and the grip is very comfortable   i love it so far  br   i would never go back to that ear shattering remington again  i have not yet taken it abroad to try the other voltage  but will in about 2 weeks  that is why i got it  but it does work well here  not too noisy and it s a nice size  this is a great product  i have long  thick  curly  red hair  and it works wonders  sometimes i want straight hair  so i ll brush and dry my hair at the same time for the straight hair  and it works great  this hair dryer dries my hair in 10 min flat  sometimes in 5 minutes depending on the day  i also love the cord that goes into the dryer itself  so awesome and convenient   you must buy this hair dryer  it will change your life     the controls are pretty straight forward  no different than most other hairdryers   has off  high  and low switch along with a cool shot that surpresses the heat for cool drying   works really well and heats nicely  i have short hair so it only took a minute to dry   i had other family members with long hair give it a shot and all agreed it was top notch     really like the metallic apple color too  makes a boring hairdryer look like a pretty cool appliance     the negative has to do with the weight  this is not what i would consider a travel hairdryer  one other reviewer mentions it weighs over 2 lbs and they thought that was light    i totally disagree  if you travel a lot you know that 2 lbs added to your suitcase can make a big difference  even lugging this thing to the gym everyday would be a work out  it does come with a travel pouch and a nice feature of easily twisting and untwisting the handle does make it a little more compact  but it is still rather bulky to stick in a gym bag or carry on suitcase     i highly recommend this unit for home use  for travel  i d suggest you find a more compact lightweight unit and skip this one  i was skeptical about paying this much for a hair dryer   but a friend of mine highly recommended it  so i gave it a go   from my frist drying experience i noticed a huge difference in my hair   it is super quiet   did dry my hair faster  with less force and no tangling   i love how light it is   and how shiney it made my hair   i got a load of compliments that first day   worth the cash  i was not expecting too much since this is your basic hair dryer   the price was good for the item   it has pretty good power  but the temperature on low and medium settings is not too hot   this does not bother me  but some may like a warmer temperature on the lower power settings  the best blow dryer i ve ever used  i may have to get another one  my wife and daughter are also using this  very powerful but quiet motor  many settings  comes with a four year warranty  highly recommended  this hair dryer has the makings of being a great one  it has a great blow  but it takes forever to heat up  after 10 minutes of use  the heat was still lacking  leaving my hair damp  i d give this one a pass and not worth the money  nice color though  br    br   katiebabs this is an excellent dryer  it is dependable and delivers the temperatures i expect  but the main reason i chose this model is that the classic squirrel cage blower produces great air flow  i was never satisfied with the wimpy blowers on most of the other styles      i bought two of these from amazon a few years ago  two  because i thought such an inexpensive dryer might not last long very long and buying the pair was a better bargain because the order qualified for free shipping  the second one is still in the box awaiting its turn  the first one hasn t failed yet     i see several comments here about travel  while this dryer is more compact than many of the bulky styling dryers  it is neither dual voltage  switchable  nor universal voltage  auto converting   so pack a converter if you carry it overseas   i use a smaller  folding  dual voltage model for travel  then find that all the hotels have built ins anyway   we purchased this item january 3  2011 for my daughter s bathroom  we installed it the following week  she uses a hairdryer infrequently  about once or twice a week   she informed us tonight that the nightlight stopped working last week and when she uses the hairdryer it smells like plastic melting  sure enough  i just checked it out  no nightlight    plastic burning smell when turned on  our return period window for amazon is now expired  i just wrote andis an email explaining what happened and will be waiting for a response  i will update what  if anything  customer service does about this situation  until then  i am giving this item one star  i love that andis 1600w dual voltage hair dryer   it s powerful enough for my short hair  but not too powerful  it s compact so it ll be great for travel  before my subjective impressions  let s note the specs first  br    br     1875w ac motor  powerful  br     2 heat speed settings br     cold air button  turns off the heat  br     easy to remove air filter br     safe alci plug   will turn itself off if blow drier is dropped in water br     one  concentrator  accessory included br     zippered black nylon travel tote br     english spanish instructions sheet br    br   the makers claim that the motor has a 3x longer life when compared to dc motor hairdryer models  they also state that the dryer is using  ionic technology  which  promotes healthy  shining hair while fighting frizz   br    br   one distinct feature is the  folding handle   you can twist it  careful or you can break it  in a way that turns the handle parallel with the body and therefore makes it easier to pack when traveling  it s also easier to store it in a drawer when not traveling  br    br   the 4 year warranty is quite good when compared with what you get for similarly priced electronics  first  it s 4 years which is not bad  second  even if you can t produce a receipt  they promise to honor the warranty based on the unit s manufacture date  you are going to pay for shipping to the service center and include  7 to have the unit shipped back  and  of course  they will not cover any damage that you may inflict  br    br   there are no  negatives  i detected  the infinity ipro gets you all the power you need  the noise level is on par to similar devices and the 4 year warranty indicates that the makers are confident that they are selling you a quality device and it appears to be so  the travel ready folding handle and the included tote bag are pluses which earn the ipro its 5 stars  br    br      br      brush your teeth  it s the law   lt  lt  the infinitipro by conair is a hair dryer that features an ingenuous design which makes it ideal for home or travel  just twist the handle to fold down  retract the cord and then pack the unit into the included zip pouch  what a great concept  br    br   without sacrificing any of the features you might expect from a great hair dryer  the compact design makes this product stand out from the competition  highly recommended  i don t understand why the packaging says ac motor and the blurb says dc   however it works great   it does have a large ish plug which i assume is a transformer from ac to dc   i love the color which is more intense than in the picture   think granny smith apple  i thought it would be smaller than it is since it is sort of billed as a travel dryer   the handle does an easy twist to fold so it fits in the accompanying bag   i don t mind the size as it is powerful enough to easily dry my longish and very thick hair and most travel dryers are pretty feeble  what more can i ask   it says it will last longer than most dryers which is great  it only has a few settings   hi and low plus a cool shot override button   all i ever use anyway  i ve always thought that the wall mounted hair dryers in hotel rooms were a great idea   they don t take up space on your bathroom counter  you don t have to wrap the cord around and around your hair dryer  which can eventually lead to internal wire damage   and you don t have to find a separate place to store it   i never thought of actually owning one in my own home until i visited my sister a few years ago  and she had this one mounted on her guest bathroom wall   it worked great  and i knew right then that i needed one of these   i wrote down the model number and went online to buy one as soon as i returned home   my husband was more than happy to install this  a couple of screws  since it meant no more hair dryers laying on the bathroom sink   we both liked it so much that he even suggested that i go ahead and buy another one and have it on hand for when the first one wore out   my granddaughter told me the other day that she needs one of these   guess i know what she s getting for christmas this year  i love being able to just sit under the dryer and read while i deep condition my hair  not too hot  and it covers my entire head  fast shipping and good pricing for hot tools   bought this for my daughter  delivered as promised  so far  about 1 month later  working fine  she is extremely happy with the product  the only minor issue i see is that there is no base to secure it on the wall  it does have a loop  so i had to install a small hook on the wall to hang it from  this dryer works great  folds up nicely  the only thing is    the handle  it is to big around  and it is to smooth  i had a hard time hanging on to it if it had some ridges that might have helped  and it was hard trying to hold the cool button down while trying to set my hair  as one who likes to travel light  i was impressed by how light this hairdryer is    it is a bit less powerful than i m used to but i m willing to take that trade off  i ve read some reviews on here that this dryer is burning people s hair off   perhaps in an attempt to correct this  revlon scaled back the heat output significantly   i say this because my dryer doesn t seem to get nearly as hot as my old  non ion dryer   i used to have a small  folding travel dryer   it burned out and i replaced it with this   my hair doesn t dry any more quickly even though the thing is easily twice as large and has ion technology   also  my old travel dryer easily got hotter than this one   the wind power isn t as strong  either  even on the highest setting   i kind of like this because my hair doesn t blow everywhere when i m using my round brush   but it seems like the high setting should be the medium setting     anyway  ok dryer   nothing to write home about  this product comes with a one year warranty from the merchant as opposed to a four year warranty from the manufacturer  there is no serial number attached to the power cord so you can t register for warranty   also our product made a distinctive sound that we did not have when we bought our first hair dryer from the manufacturer directly 5 years ago    lesson learned  wanted to try to save on the purchase price  lost on the quality and warranty  attempting to return the product  i would advise not to buy this product from this merchant  i have had this for more than a few months now  and can say it works wonderfully   i have not noticed  personally  and huge difference because of the tourmaline ions  but that isn t to say that there isn t any   i have pretty normal hair  and it has stayed pretty normal   i will say that this system seems to dry my hair a bit faster and it does not get that brittle feel to it when i actually use it to style my hair as well   good product  good price   not a miracle worker  but reliability is sometimes more important than miracles    this hair dryer was recommended by my hair stylist  it would cost  200 at a retail store  she suggested i check on amazon for a better price  i got the hair dryer for half the retail price  the ionic ceramic tourmaline dryer is less damaging to hair  the best thing is that it s quiet for a blow dryer     more of a hum than a high pitch whistle of some blow dryers  i am always looking for organizational tips   when i saw this hair dryer i thought this would be perfect to cover the hole that a non operating  wall phone would leave  it is perfect and no storage problem   works well   asin b000rzll38 oster professional 76932 710 wall mount hair dryer   i use it a lot  i am a stylist and use this with my really curly hair clients and it never disapoint me  great price  great quality  great buy  good size  nice to be out of the way and on the wall  unfortunately  it stopped working 9 months after i bought it  i was sent a replacement and hopefully  this one will work longer  i have been using this product for nearly a month now  from a guy perspective i think this product is really great  i use this product since my hair is quite long and for some personal reason i don t like to dry my hair using my towel  anyway  the best thing about this hair dryer is that it dries my hair really fast and also produce low noise  well  if you use the high air mode  the noise is quite loud but much tolerable than other products i have used  basically i just used the low air mode since the noise is low and it isn t too hot      furthermore  when you first use this product  it will have a burning metal smell  like soldering smell   however  after 3 4 times of use the smell will be gone  the smell won t stick on your hair though  so it isn t a big deal  this hair dryer is light which i think is a plus  ok  beautiful color  stylish  not heavy seems long lasting probably a good dryer for the right person   unfortunately i will have to return it   this dryer takes a very long time to dry the  hair  it is not hot or powerful enough this should be best for fine hair   it is kind of uncomfortable to hold as well   i feel sad since i have to return it but it is not right for me  love the pink color but what can you do  i bought this hair dryer to replace another conair i had for many years   after one year i am going back to my old one   there is no way to clean the vents on this one and it heats up hot   it burned the top of my ear the other day   the retractable cord is a nice idea  but if it retracts too fast you end up with bruises from it hitting you in the arm   look for the conair dryers that have vents that can be cleaned and they will last you a good long time   then only good thing about it is it travels well  i purchased the fhi heat nano salon pro 2000 six months ago  and it was love at first blowdry  during high school and college  i owned a series of inexpensive  low quality hair dryers  yes  after half an hour or more and some expletives  they did dry my hair  but it was always flat and without shine  i blamed my hair  rather than the hair dryers  br    br   at the warm heat setting and high fan setting  this fhi hair dryer gives me soft  voluminous waves in less than fifteen minutes  i never knew my hair could look so beautiful and healthy  i blow dry it immediately after every morning shower  and i use   asin b004461zl4 sedu anti frizz polishing treatment with argan oil  6 8 oz  bottle    br    br   oh  and i almost forgot  the first time i turned it on  i thought i had received a defective model like some of the other reviewers  but i had accidentally pressed the blue cold shot button found on the inside of the hair dryer handle  br    br   update  after one year   i still love this hair dryer  and it s working just as well as the day i purchased it  love the look and feel of this hair dryer  a little heavier than i thought it would be but much quieter than my old conair and i am pleased with the results   folds and packs well for travel and i like the retractable cord  would recommend it  bought this model a few years ago and i really like it because the high setting speed is just right for styling your hair   some other dryers i have blow too fast on the high setting   this model s high setting is a good speed and allows you to dry your hair without it blowing all over the place   also it is light and well balanced so holding it while drying is very comfortable   i recently bought 2 more in case the manufacturer decides to stop production  this is a nice hair dryer   it s up there with some of the  100 dryers i have purchased   it isn t whisper quiet  but it dries hair fairly quickly   i love that it has four different heat settings   i have long  super thick hair  so i need a strong dryer  and this definitely does the job  some reviews here refer to a 5 year warrantee  no doubt true at the time  but instructions now say one year and       return shipping fee  i have limited space in my apartment  every inch counts  that doesn t mean that i don t want the best  and i have it in this teeny tiny dryer  tucks into one of my baskets when not in use  but when in use  works like a charm  my hair type is naturally wavy  thick  and frizz prone   with this hairdryer  my hair is not frizzy   yay   it s super powerful  and dries my hair quicker than my old hairdryer   this hairdryer is so great  it makes the need for my straightener optional   i have the argan heat straightener  and love it  too   they are the perfect pair to get silky  shiny hair   i also like that my hair feels soft with this  the comb attachment consistly flies when trying to dry hair  the design is flawed as that the comb does not stay securely when using the dryer  thought that is the comb attachment came with the dryer it would fit securely  i loved my first oster wall mount hair dryer  it lasted 8 years before i had to replace it with the same model  no  2 just died after 7 years  dependable service  the plastic fins on the fan became brittle and snapped off   there s no use trying to improve on such a reliable product  so i m ordering no  3  the current price is only slightly higher than what i paid for the other two  i love this hairdryer  but for some people  they may not be completely ecstatic with the settings of this hairdryer   with this hairdryer  you cannot really control the temperature of the air  only how intense the air flows from the dryer   the only way to change the temperature of the air is to press the blue button on the hair dryer to make the air cooler   other than that side note  i love the color of the hairdryer and how quickly it dries my hair  my hair is long and it takes about 15 minutes to blow dry my hair   was very pleased with this purchase   the profile is slim and looks well to hang on wall   it has different speeds with pleases me   very happy to have purchased this as a replacement  for one i had for years   jerdon 1600w wall mount hair dryer powerful hairdryer   it doesn t have a cool setting  so if that is a concern check out the other andis dryers   love the bright night light  it is a soft white  i bought this dryer to replace a virtually identical but much older vidal sassoon hair dryer  the vs781  which had finally stopped working after probably a decade   the thing i liked most about the older dryer  and which i like about this one  which is basically the same dryer with a new color and model number   is that it doesn t get excessively hot even on the highest setting  and doesn t blow as hard as most other dryers       for someone with thick hair this might be a real problem  but i ve got very thin  fine  slightly frizzy hair that doesn t benefit from a strong airflow   most hair dryers  even on lower speeds  dry sections of my hair so rapidly that i don t have a proper chance to style them with a brush  and the rest of my rather sparse hair gets whipped around as if in a tornado   that doesn t happen with this vidal sassoon model   the oval shaped barrel seems to also help concentrate the airflow       i also like the fact that this dryer has three heat settings and two speed settings which can be selected independently   with some dryers high speed is paired with high heat whether you want it or not       the ionic setting on this dryer does make a difference and makes my hair a tad smoother   however it also tends to make it more limp   so as a rule  i use the dryer with the ion setting in the off position except when drying the ends of my shoulder length hair   probably someone with thick  coarse hair wouldn t have this issue          i ve had this dryer for only about 5 weeks  so it s too early to comment on whether it s built to last   i was definitely lucky to get so many years out of my older model   this model might not be just right for every head of hair  but for mine  it s perfect   i hope vidal sassoon continues making this type of dryer for a long time  note   i do not own this hair dryer  but to add a review i had to add a star rating   i used the average of 4 stars to keep the rating unchanged  br    br   please note that a lot of these hair dryers do nothing more than mechanically lock out the on off switch from using the hi temp setting when set for 220 volt input for foreign countries   that is very typical  br    br   please also note that the low heat mode at 220 volts does not work the same as 110 volts   from an electrical point of reference  doubling the voltage yields a four fold increase in power  wattage    if the low heat mode at 110 volts  usa value  is 400 watts  then using this dryer in low heat mode at 220 volts  eg  europe  would generate 1600 watts   that s the way the power equation works   that s how my current unit worked when we vacationed in europe   low heat mode at 220 volts generates high heat and a fast fan speed  br    br   what you lose is the low power curling and shaping mode when using these dryers at 220 volts   there is no 400 watt option in the 220 volt setting  br    br   if you want both high and low heat modes  buy a transformer to convert 220 to 110 volts  and be sure it is big enough  power wise  to handle the 110 volt high heat wattage    the cost  beyond the purchase price of the transformer  is the added transformer weight in your travel luggage  br    br   i hope this clarifies how these type hair dryers work in europe      a retired electrical engineer  br    br   ps   going from usa 60 hertz  a k a  60 cycles  to european 50 hertz makes no difference for this appliance  br    br   pps  none of the 220 v countries use our 110 v two prong or three prong wall plug   even if you don t buy the transformer  br     you will need a plug converter kit to plug this hair dryer into the 220 v wall outlet  found with the luggage in most department stores or on br     amazon under plug converter   but be sure to get the 220 to 110 version and not the 110 to 220 for europeans visiting usa   i gave this dryer to my sister  who raved about it and said it was the best hair dryer she d ever used  here is the review she wrote for me     the remington pearl ceramic hair dryer comes with a full line of useful features       among its better aspects  the dryer is attractive  lightweight  and marvellously quiet  it has a cool shot as well as three heat settings which get warm enough to dry hair quickly  without frying it     the dryer comes with an attached hook from which it can be hung  as well as a diffuser and a concentrator  the result is sleek  straight  or wavy hair    depending on which attachment you use  i highly recommend this dryer  i can find nothing negative to say about it     so    there ya go  i had first seen used this hairdryer at a hampton inn and was impressed with how well it performed  quiet  powerful  and solid   not too heavy  with a grippy handle   so   i bought one for myself and love it  it works great for the price  it s not loud at all compared to a small portable one i upgraded from    the only qualms that i have is that there s no separate set of buttons for heat settings   basically the higher speed setting is also the hottest and vice a versa for the the lowest  i received the hair dryer nov 15 and by the end of january high had totally quit working   by the time i was able to get on line the end of february  because of personal issues  to find out how to return it  it was too late to get free shipping and a full refund  so guess i m stuck with it  i received this hair dryer yesterday and used it today for the first time       what i liked    i was really drawn to the price and i still feel that it a great value    it has two settings  the low is nice and cool and the high is warm but not too hot  i like this because i try to use as little heat as possible    it has a lot of holes in the hood so it drys your hair very quickly      it s not as loud as i thought it would be     what i didn t like and might also bother other users    i don t use rollers  but for anyone who does  this hood might be a bit small    i m 5  10 and the height is perfect for me  so if you are shorter that might be an issue  i used it at my kitchen table    there aren t enough holes around the back so about 3 4 way through you have to turn around with your body facing the machine  that s ultimately my biggest dislike about the machine     overall i m happy with the item and i d order it again  hope this helps  i tried this product last night  let my hair dry naturally  went to bed  barely brushed it this a m  went snowboarding with full head  face mask and helmet  it was cold    hair was only mildly messy when i removed helmet  ran a brush through it and it  looks  awesome  like i just washed it and had a blowout  it s soft  bouncy and shiny  i never write beauty reviews  and it s even rarer that i will spend over  20 on a hair product  this is worth it  really unbelievable  i like the tangle teaser brush   it does detangle hair more gently than a comb or denman brush   i dont feel like my hair is thoroughly brushed afterwards   i think becasue the teeth give so easily    i do  use it a lot though and would recommend it to be added to anyones grooming routine   but i still feel as though another brush or comb would be needed to complete the grooming  it smells good  is a nice texture  not too thick  not runny   and doesn t weigh down my long  fine hair   i rub a bit on the split ends on any stray hairs   a great grooming creme   a little goes a long way   cool pink pump container  too  bought this for my brother for christmas   he really likes it   it is now discontinued but he said that curves is the same fragrance what can i say  moroccan oil products are awesome     unlike other products that claim they repair your hair but only act as a bandage  moroccan oil products actually repair your hair and improve the look and feel   they also smell amazing  its awesome   you just have to dab a little bit on your eyelid and rub it in  with your finger  i would recommend it to anyone    i bought this aftershave in california a few years ago while on holiday im from scotland and when iwear it everyone comments on it guys and girls if im in a bar or club people always ask me what im wearing and how good it smells i don t wear anything else now thank goodness  a f opened a store in the uk its an aftershave u can wear anytime love it i picked this lotion up at wal mart one spring in the summer tanning products section   i loved the smell and it made my skin soft without being greasy   i ve never peeled while using this lotion  when i ran out  i was very disappointed that  this was apparently a one time stock for wal mart   i checked over and over again to no avail   imagine my surprise when i found it in the christmas tree shop and for less money   i immediately bought four bottles   i cannot remember the exact price  but i believe it is cheaper in christmas tree shops than it is here on amazon  lots of natural ingredients too  which is a plus for me as i have atopic skin   great product  from the bottle and the rave reviews i expected a nice deep purple maroon color  but the polish is thin  so unless you can get it on perfectly you need more coats  and this causes it to be extremely dark  it s still nice  but i feel like i have black nail polish on  in low light it even seems like it is black  i don t love it as much as some people must  because i don t think i would buy this again  this lovely boxed gift set arrived on time was a gift and was greatly appreciated by the recipient   the box is actually pretty enough to keep treassured trinkets in or letters or whatever   the fragrance is very pleasant   very nice this is a great price for this product   if your hair needs some tlc from the dry  winter air  this is a great shampoo  this product works great  tried many different hair removal techniques and this one being one of the best i found   only complaints i have for this item is that i only received the four larger discs and not any of the smaller discs  i made shea custard with this gel   i got the recipe off of curly nikki forum     my hair loved it  i got great curl definition with none of the hardness that comes from using gel alone  i ve never used a pumice stone before so when i purchased this one and used it for the first time  i was pleasantly surprised at how it worked  my tootsies were soft on the bottom like they hadn t been all winter  br    br   i m so glad i purchased this  plus  the little string allows me to hang it with my loofah  i ve had this shaver for over two months now  being in my early 60 s  i ve been shaving a long time  having had many shavers in my life i d rate this one as a good shaver  i ve had other panasonic shavers that did work better  but cost much much more  for me the bottom line is this is a good shaver at a great price  i think this product is ok  but overpriced and there is more of the bottle than there is of the moisturizer   peter thomas roth should start lowering his prices for his products   i can buy more products cheaper than his from kohls that also do wonders for my skin and they at least  allow the consumer to use their discounts on every item including perfumes and make up      i have very naturally healthy and shiny  very straight dark hair  like that of the native amercans  my hair holds a curl very well  i already owned 2 different kinds of ceramic wavers and was looking for a more natural and less kinky kind of wave  this waver is ok  but not really what i expected  in my opinion it is not much different than the other wavers that are not described as deep wavers  i do hold hot tools brand in high regard from owning their products for numerous years  i would definitely take this deep waver over the other regular wavers  but wish i wouldn t have invested more money into the same kind of thing  more or less  i also do not like the dial adjustment used to set the temp on this because it is loose and changes on its own  i taped mine down so that it wouldn t accidentally set to a higher temp and burn my hair  hope this is helpful  amazed no one has given thumbs up on this hair color product   naturcolor is the best permanent herbal based hair color i ve ever used   after many professional hair color mishaps  i decided to go it on my own  and that was a decade ago  when i found naturcolor at my local health market   i ve gotten many compliments on my highlights  and natural color   it doesn t strip my hair  and doesn t turn it artificially yellow   why isn t everyone using naturcolor   they should  i use sesame blond 9n on the roots  leaving it for about 20 minutes  then i put the left overs just on the top of my hair for another 5 minutes and shampoo  and i am summer blond  you ll save a lot on stylist fees and have a more natural look    susan if you are like me  the cheap cotton rounds shred when using them leaving annoying pieces of cotton all over your hand and face   i ve always paid more for premium rounds less likely to shred and they are becoming harder to find in the stores in my area   these don t shred and have the choice of an exfoliating side or soft side   search carefully at amazon com to find the lowest cost   i got mine for  19 99 for a box of 8 tubes and free shipping when i added another free shipping product that i also wanted   i m happy to store these until i use them given the quality and price i paid  the 3 jars are a much better deal and love the foam   after 4 months hair growing in really good    after washing your hands with this soap  even though i rinse my hands thoroughly  they sill feel really soft and velvety after drying  in the couple weeks since switching to this soap my hands have never felt better  i have somewhat dry skin and most soaps really irritate my skin and i try to rinse well to prevent itchiness  i ve found that not only do i not have to rinse very long but i rarely get itchy anymore and i love the smell of tea tree oils  which was what persuaded me to get this to begin with  i started using spf moisturizer in my early 20 s   part of the way in i remembered my grandmother used the original oil of olay and i switched to this brand   it is much more expensive than the one i used to use but worth the switch   i used the lotion wrongly assuming it was cream  but the cream lasts longer and my skin is noticeably more supple and moisturized upon use   my little sister also in her 20 s has caught on and begun to use it as well   nothing substitutes taking care of your body from the inside so your outside looks great  but i swear by this moisturizer and it has not failed me for years and hopefully for many years to come  i have owned a makeup mirror for many years and this one is better than the other two i have owned   this is one is more stable no matter what position you have it sitting in  i made the mistake of trusting that the picture on this product page was actually a picture of what i would get   it clearly says that it is sls free fluoride toothpaste   the toothpaste i received is sls free  but does not have fluoride   i m in the process of returning it  have used this sunscreen for several years and know that it is a superb product   i especially like the fact that it is fragrance free and can be used under makeup easily  there is no way not to recommend this product  since the first time i used i felt the difference in my hair  it s softer and brighter  sometimes with other conditioners  hair tends to fell  but you won t feel this with sos reparacion  very uncomfortable  i can t have it on for more than 5 minutes  i bought it because it was cheap  but i guess you get what you paid for  a cheap product with cheap quality this cream is amazing   it is light  absorbs quickly  and doesn t have a dramatic scent   it has been very effective for my skin during the winter months when i typically struggle to keep my skin moisturized   this is especially true for my face   i usually struggle with dry patches on my face in the winter that only look highlighted by makeup and i hadn t found a moisturizer that ridded it completely   this was the one   i use it morning and night and haven t had an issue with dry patches  at all   my powder makeup glides on easily afterward and the cream does not feel heavy or oily   wonderful stuff   i also use it as a body lotion   equally as great results   highly recommend this to anyone who wants a good cream that doesn t have to be continuously reapplied    added bonus   the price is great through subscribe and save  i have not recieved this product so i can t give an accurate review  i would like someone to contact me  it s been over a month since i ordered this product  this is the only detangler i have found anywhere that will work on both my daughter s hair and not leave it greasy   they are now 13 and 9 and very picky about how their hair looks all of the time   i can even dilute it half with water and it still does an outstanding job of keeping snarls and frizzies under control every day   only down side is that there are no local stores that carry this product any more    as a scent o phile  this was a classic that just had to be tested for my collection  visit basenotes dot net to read about the legacy of this fragrance  if you like creed s version of original vetiver  but find it a bit too clean and light for a vetiver  you really must try guerlain s formulation  this set is not the newest recipe  but the previous one from the 90s  apparently the newer version is a bit brighter  but not nearly as rich  br    br   this starts clean with a hint of lemon and grass clippings  but quickly dries down to an earthy and slightly mineralic cedar  final dry down is to a rich and exceptionally warm woody oak moss with a powdery overlay  soapy clean permeates throughout the entire range of the scent   this is mature  masculine and a barbershop clean classic  makes creed s version seem flat and incredibly overpriced  br    br   the edt miniature is splash only  no spray   the aftershave lotion smells even warmer than the edt  due to high oil content and no alcohol  the bath gel shampoo is a bit chemical smelling at first  but complements the cologne well enough  this color is darker and more ash  br   it will really eliminate brassy and gold tones  if you ve had your hair lightened and are dissatisfied with brassiness  br   if you don t like the result  it s simple to wash out  it is a temporary to semi permanent color  br   i love it  conair is a great brand for hair dryers  my previous one was still going after 8 years but figured it was just time for an upgrade  this hair dryer is great  heats up quickly  dries hair fast and really does have a comfortable grip  the cool air button gets cold fast too  and it s not very loud  even on high  great quality product for the price  i purchased this dryer on sale at cvs  i love the cord keeper  i just hold onto the cord while it s retracting  the removable filter is much better than other dryers i ve used  because there is a plastic piece that keeps lint from actually getting into the dryer  this dryer is much more powerful and lighter then any other dryer i ve ever used  i have very thick coarse hair  with other dryers it took me 45 minutes to over and hour to blow dry my hair  this one dries my hair in 15   30 minutes  it leaves my hair looking and feeling fabulous  it gives my hair more volume and straightens my hair better than my other dryers  i still have to use a flatiron  but it only takes one pressing on each section instead of several to get it to lay flat     i strongly recommend this product  ordered 2 of the 3500  but received the 3200  which was a lower model  lower priced  by mistake  somehow  i don t believe that  i feel as if they were trying to see if i would notice the difference  then when i asked for an exchange  they said they didn t have any more of the 3500s  sounds fishy to me  i tested this hair dryer at a ritz carlton and loved it   didn t even unpack my own   i ordered one upon my return and have been using it daily for over a month   my short  permed hair stays shiny and does not dry out   this dryer is fantastic   the retracting cord works smoothly  too  bought this after using one elsewhere  has good weight  good power  dries fast  not too loud  only down side  the director nozzle falls off easily  otherwise  a very good by   ne this is a replacement wall mounted hair dryer   i had one exactly like it that i mounted in my bathroom 13 years ago when we moved into our new home   it is extremely handy and up out of the way   i never have to deal with tangly cords or plugging it in   it s powerful and efficient   if it weren t awesome  i wouldn t have bought my second one   you won t be disappointed  the fit and finish of this product is excellent  it has a high quality blower fan and the exterior material as commented by a previous reviewer is designed to avoid scratching on the counter  br    br   my girlfriend loves this dryer because it is powerful and she has a lot of hair which is difficult to completely dry and straighten  although she did mention that on the lower heat setting it avoids overheating  br    br   this dryer has a 4 year warranty so what else can you say  it is a high quality dryer  i rarely ever write customer reviews  but this one seemed to warrant it  here goes     if you want a hair dryer that burns off your hair and can potentially make you bald  this hair dryer is for you  for a waste of  18  21 american  you too can be a 21 year old female with symptoms of female pattern baldness     wow     this little hottie also turns healthy  beautiful hair into crispy  damaged sh    even when you hold the damned thing 6 inches away from your head     but wait  there s more     wait just a few years until this baby shoots out sparks from both ends of the body at 6 a m  one fine monday morning  like it did for me this morning   and risk both burning off massive chunks of your hair  and  severely burning your right hand causing a facial deformity via an electical spark  yes     the lesson of the day is  do not buy this hair dryer piece of sh   or any helen of troy product if you would prefer to keep a normal looking hair visage self  their products are d a n g e r o u s c r a p  i was always a wash and wear kinda gal  but recently i had my hair straightened and the beautician suggested to blow dry out after washing   she told me the elchim professional 2001 was the best and they last for a long time   she had many years on her dryer and it is used lots everyday   that sounded like the best option for me   if i was going to invest  i wanted it to be good and have a long happy life   it seems to be well balanced and has lots of power   my thick hair is dry in 10 minutes   i am very satisfied with my purchase and no regrets   the product was delivered quickly   i was suprised that the dryer was in a box with no packing to secure it inside   i thought that was odd   i am sure that it was bounced around from the wearhouse and across the nation by all who touched it   that part did concern   i hope it did not affect the life of my product   time will tell  but so far so good  i loved it   while it worked   it lasted about six months before it just     died   first it quit working on high and then it quit working all together   i really like having a mounted hair dryer in my small space so i ll be looking for a new one  it simply won t be another one of these  i know this was voted best hairdryer    by like 5 beauty magazines  and it does seem to dry hair pretty efficiently  but this review applies to guys with short hair that need to use a hair dryer to shape their hair into styles  such as mohawks or fauxhawks   this is useful for you stylish gents who are not just looking for a device to merely dry hair  br    br   i find that the high setting air current is not strong enough to really get your hair into staying straight upwards  if you re going for a mohawk or even a pompadour  and keep it there  the way some of the stronger hairdryers can   especially if you have a thicker hair structure  wavy  curly   or your hair falls naturally in a certain way but you want it to be styled in an opposite direction  using more hair product helps a little  but a stronger air current will work better  even though it is more damaging for your hair   scalp  so use carefully and wisely  br    br   i figured there are enough men out there looking for just this function  so i figured i d help you all out  i am glad that i bought this product its powerful and if you want you can reduce the power as you wish its the perfect thing i was looking for  i decided to go ahead and buy from amazon since the 5 star ratings far exceeded the negatives   got it about 15 months ago  and totally loved it  it was light and quiet and fast  i have medium length  super thick  baby fine  curly hair   about a month ago  it started getting louder  then it just stopped  i opened it up and one of the blades had broken inside   i have never dropped this  and it always goes back in the drawer   i even wrap and secure the cord every time  i took out the partially broken piece  and used it for a couple more weeks  however  its even louder now  like a jet engine and vibrates ferociously  never again  i thought i was buying a great hair dryer that would last me for years  haha  i need to replace this dryer  i have somewhat fine hair  and this dryer is frying it on the ends  i m going to purchase a revlon tourmaline dryer again  i had one previously  which worked great  but died after a few years of use  guess i was caught up in how cute this one is  if you have fine hair  stay away  i decided to buy this hair dryer after sifting through consumer reports and customer reviews  i couldn t be happier to have the quality of this dryer at the price i paid  i have very thick  longer hair that used to take me 10 15 minutes to get completely dry in the past  i have never used this new dryer for longer than 5 minutes because it dries so quickly without leaving that singed  damaged feel i used to get with my old dryer  the ceramic ionic features must be doing their jobs because it really lives up to the description  love the retractable cord  i m very impressed  i ve had this hairdryer now for about 3   4 weeks   just love the low heat setting   temperature remains comfortably low even when increasing the speed to high   it is fairly light and quieter than others i ve had  this drys my long hair in no time at all  i only use the medium setting because the full blast air actually blows it around so much it gets tangled  overall it has a very nice design  works really well  and i m glad i bought it  i used this product once and i want to take it back  i set my hair in medium sized rollers and i found that i couldn t fit my entire head under the dryer  and it was incredibly loud  i must say that i like the fact that the dryer got hot enough to dry my hair  that could fit in   but not hot enough to cause damage  in order to get back of my hair some air time  i had to turn facing the dryer and tilt my head down  obviously that wasn t too comfortable  if i can get rid of this dryer i will  but if not i will live with it  next time i will go for a hood dryer with a more circular design  instead of the cone style that this one has  im sure that ll help me to get my whole head in  i know it s an obnoxious color but the bottom line is  it works amazingly well  it s powerful but not super loud  for a hair dryer  at least   i can get my long hair dry and straight in about 8 10 minutes on warm temperature   medium strength  i d rather take a couple extra minutes than do extra damage to my hair   and the settings are user friendly  before i bought it  i didn t care so much about the retractable cord but now that i ve had it for a while  i don t think i could ever go back  it s an incredibly convenient feature  especially living in a tiny nyc apartment  i highly recommend this product  i am a hair stylist and i was looking for a lightweight hair dryer  this is an ok hair dryer  it dries pretty good  a couple things i dislike are that it s very loud and the attachment does not stay on well  i will not use this dryer on clients but i will for home use  i have no problems with the hair dryer itself  however  one can t register the warranty because the company s drop down menu does not list the year 2011  i sent conair two emails regarding the  year  problem and neither was answered  when i finally was able to contact someone on the phone i was told that yes  the year was a problem  but the company didn t have any answer for fixing it  including not being able to take my information over the phone  also told me that they are having problems with the company which handles their emails and none get answered  perhaps i expected too much from conair  next time i will seek out another brand  also feel that if one can not register a product for the warranty  then amazon should think twice before dealing with that company  a long time ago  this dryer was in a favorite hotel chain   i loved being able to push it back onto the wall without stopping to turn it off first   today  there is more room on the counter with the dryer safe on the wall   the cord stays out of the sink  too  a bit heavier than most and cost a little more but but it is a whole bunch better than the cheaper ones   definitely a good product i am really enjoying the hair dryer and enjoy the wall mount so it hangs out of the way nicely  first used this product at a hotel in vegas   bought one for home and love it   leaves hair smooth and retractable cord makes for easy storage  i used this hair dryer while staying at a marriott hotel and loved it   my hair dries in a much shorter amout of time and comes out soft without the frizz   the folding handle and retractable cord make it easy to transport and store   i ordered an ionic hair dryer from my hairdresser which was three times more expensive  didn t work nearly as well  and broke within a year   my daughter in law used it recently and couldn t believe how quickly her hair dried       this is a great hair dryer but it dosen t dry your hair any faster than any other dryer it s just hype  so if you looking for a shorter drying time then look somewhere else  but this dryer does make your hair super soft  softer than any other dryer that i ve used and i ve tried several brands  over all i would buy it again  ok  i am not a hair stylist  for that matter in a few years drying my hair will be an act of remembrance   that being said  my wife  the primary user of this  loves this   the dual heat and fan controls allows her to get just the right touch   from my perspective  this is well built   heavier that the usual hair dryer and with an easily removable rear grate that will prevent the fan from burning out over prolonged use   you will get many years out of this great dryer  this hair dryer is the most powerful i ve ever used  it actually kicks when you start it  that s how much air rushes out of the nozzle  the warm air drying field   because of the dryer s unusual strength   is wider and more focused than any other that i ve tried  the controls are remarkably easy to use  they require hardly any pressure  seeming to respond instantly when pressed  ergonomically the remington ac2015 is well designed  fitting in my hand quite comfortably  other hair dryers are often indifferently designed  their weight soon tiring your hands and arms requiring constant switching between left and right hands  this dryer stayed in my right hand without cramping or fatigue  which i really appreciate  br    br   the three heat settings and two speeds are perfect for the subtle changes your hair undergoes during the drying process  there s a big difference between the extremely wet hair you confront when first leaving the shower and the dryer  more responsive hair you have after a couple of minutes of drying  with the different heat settings and two speeds   coupled with the dryer s strength   i manage to avoid some of the heat damage that i used to inflict on my hair  back then  i was forced to crank up my inferior dryer in order to get better  and quicker  drying  heat damaged  overly dry  even dessicated  hair is unmanageable and very unsightly  i am thankful those days appear to be gone for good  the attachments are easy to add and use though i never need them  finding the dryer in its native state to be best for my hair  the dryer runs quietly and without sparking  something that can be worrisome when your hands are moist  there s a four year warranty which indicates the confidence the manufacturer has in this well made dryer  the remington ac2015 is an excellent professional grade dryer that is easy to recommend  it is still working  i like that  i ordered it up sometime ago for the mrs  she s has made no complaints which pleases me so conair has done good with this one  it s styled like a profession hair dryer  but it s not  it s not as solidly manufactured  especially the buttons  the high heat setting is slightly too hot  and the low airflow setting seems weak  br    br   this is a fine mid range dryer and a good value for the price  but you will likely have to pay over  100 for a true professional dryer  br    br   my comparison dryer is the elchim professional 2001  that is a real professional dryer  i purchased this as a christmas present and how embarrassing was it when the person i purchased it for said  well  i loved it until i used it the third time and when i went to take off the concentrator the whole front of the blow dryer fell apart  i guess we ll see how highly rated this seller really is  he hasn t responded to my email still  this hair dryer works fast to dry hair  it s quiet in operation even on high speed  br    br   the body of the dryer is smooth feeling  kind of soft almost  not like a hard shiny plastic feels  it s a nice touch  br    br   there is a removable intake filter allowing a clean fan  br    br   the cord is long enough to use the dryer comfortably  br    br   there is plenty of power and heat to dry even the longest hair quickly  the added pearl ceramics is supposed to help with prevent hair damage  we ll see  br    br   you could pay more for a hair dryer  but why  i love this blow dryer   what a great purchase   you won t be disappointed   it makes my hair shiny and smooth after using this blow dryer and dries fast too   i highly recommend  loved it i finally realized just how much my tiny travel hairdryer was damaging my hair so i started searching for a new one  i picked this one  and i am very happy with it so far  i use a small amount of leave in conditioner and a few drops of a defrizz product and my hair turns out great  the dryer has a nice array of settings  i usually put it on the hottest setting because the others don t seem warm enough  the cool setting works well  too  the dryer is fairly quiet  too  even at high settings  which is a huge change from my travel dryer  the one drawback i ve found so far is the weight of this dryer  my travel dryer was of course very light and compact so it s been an adjustment getting used to the size and weight of this one  my arm gets a little tired as i m finishing  but it s not a big problem  definitely a good purchase  puchased november 2010  i liked this hair dryer but it blew after 6 weeks   however  i contacted the company and they replaced it within about a week at no cost  very happy with my new hair dryer  great for easy drying natural curls   the dryer arrived quickly and in perfect condition  i bought this hairdryer as an extra but for an 1875 watt blowdryer this hairdryer is weak   the medium and high settings blow equivalent air  maybe i just got a defective one  i have a conair one that is much better  this product has some nice features  i have purchased two of them for different bathrooms in my home   i was surprised when the first one i bought died after barely passing the two year mark   i may buy another one just because i like this dryer but i definitely know what to expect now  i just got this hair dryer a few days ago to replace one that randomly stopped working  i love this product so far  it is very sturdy without being too heavy  the cord reel is a great feature and makes storage very easy      the hair dryer itself works great  compared to my last one  this dries so fast  the temperature settings are also very nice with the hot not being  too  hot  and the cool is actually cool  i hope this dryer performs as well in the future as it has so far  this is by far the best blowdryer i have ever used  i ve been using conair s yellowbird for 33 years  since i was 13  after using the blackbird  i am equally impressed  if not more   my 25 year old daughter is now a big fan as well  i highly recommend these blowdryers   as i said  by far the best  i bought this as a replacement for my daughter s old compact hairdryer   i haven t used it myself  but based on what she said  it is small  light  cute  not obnoxiously loud  doesn t get too hot  and doesn t suck her hair into the intake  like her old one did   the first day she used it  she came downstairs and said  either i m having a fabulously lucky hair day  or this hairdryer is as awesome as it s supposed to be   we are pleased with the purchase and would buy this item again  before purchasing this hair dryer i read pretty much all of the reviews on the earlier edition   the ratings were high  so i decided to get the latest edition and try it out   i wasn t sure if the dryer would work wonders with my hair type   as an african american female with natural hair  finding a blow dryer that straightens as well as dries quickly is always a process   but using the andis is like a breath of fresh air  it takes me about 10 15 to dry my hair with the comb extension   and yay for the comb extension  i am so happy with my purchase i have been telling everyone i know to get it   it is a nice unit  compact and easy to use but it takes a long time to dry my hair  after a few weeks of using this wall mount hair dryer  i am impressed  works great  very functional  nice looking  some side comments are that the night light is very bright and there doesn t seem to be an option to turn it off  also  it holds very tight in the mount and you have to pull it rather firmly to get it out  everytime i do this  the base looks like it wants to come out of the wall  time will only tell   it will probably loosen up over more use  i ve owned many cheap dryers   30 40  and a few pricier ones   60 80    i took a leap and paid more for what i hoped would be the perfect dryer   it does the job  has a nice  compact size  great cord length  but the dryer is so loud   i still use the dryer  but after my 5 year old complained  i stopped using it on her hair   it is simply too loud   actually look forward to it breaking so i can feel justified to purchase a quieter replacement  i bought this hairdryer under the impression that i was getting some magnificent piece of equipment  at  200  this magnificent piece of equipment starting whistling at me within days of using it  i went back to the store  and they kindly exchanged it  about one week later  it began whistling again  i went back to the store and they exchanged it for me  the third hairdryer i received didn t whistle until about a month of using it  because this hairdryer got so many great reviews  i was willing to exchange it one more time  and so  i got my fourth hairdryer in 2008  it worked great up until about four days ago when i smelled something that smelled like it was burning  that alarmed me  but i ignored it  then two days later  i heard something pop inside my hairdryer  after that  there was a piece of something rattling around inside of it  i finally had had enough  so today  i returned my hairdryer and got my money back  my husband did some research  and we found a great  35 hairdryer that works just as well  if not better  than the  200 piece of crap that i had to return multiple times  my old dryer broke and i was not sure what kind of product i wanted to get  it turned out the sedu revolution pro is the answer   it feels like a real professional dryer  would recommend to anyone  i bought this hairdryer to replace my  200 hairdryer that crapped out on me four times  i have only used it twice  but i am very happy with it  i don t notice any difference between the performance of the two  my mother gave me this dryer around 15 years ago  and still working   i m buying the same one since the electric cord is acting up    no questions about it is the best one   not sure if it s because of the attachment  but even on the highest setting this dryer just isn t that powerful   i have a really short pixie cut and it s taking me almost twice as long to dry as my old cheap y dryer   humm  this dryer offers all the options you need and delivers the good solid service in an almost professional manner   i find it easy to use and very effective and easy to move around   three speeds and heat levels give you every option plus it has an ionic mode as well   for the money a very good purchase  like this hair blower  however i was not too happy went i saw it at walgreens for  25 on sale as compared with your price of  38 the jerdan dryer has given us a broken switch after just a couple months of use   has done this with 3 different dryers   i would not recomend this dryer to any one go for the sumbeam oster a much better product so far  i have been pleased with the purchase   if that changes  i will come back and adjust my review  i am a hair stylist at a busy salon and i don t know what i would do without my t3 bespoke dryer  it blows very hot but not too hard so it dries the hair without making it frizz  the only negative is that they re not made of the best quality parts  i had my last one for 2 years which is the length of the warranty before it broke which for me is a good run  for an at home use would last longer  i was in desperate need of a new hair dryer  i read several different reviews on amazon com and decided to go with the remington d 2012  i am very happy with my decision  i have been using the hair dyer now for a few weeks now and have definitely noticed a difference in my hair  the dryer leaves my hair feeling really soft and super shiny   it would be great if it was a little lighter  weight wise  but i would not say it is heavy at all  bought the tun turbo to replace my elchim blowdryer that in had for years  purchased the twin turbo based on the reviews and that it is lighter weight then the elchim with the same power  i received my new twin turbo and i am pleased with the wright   power and   attachments i am not pleased with the fact that the of the blowdryer does not have a guard like the chi or the elchim have that protects your hair from being sucked into the motor  ouch and it burns your hair  basically you need to be super careful and not rush when using this dryer or your hair will be ruined  this hairdryer was my favorite one until it mysteriously stopped working one day for no reason   when it did work  it dried my hair  thick   wavy  in about 5 minutes   i also loved the retractable cord   when unfolded  this is a full size hairdryer and it is weighty which i liked about it   however  it won t turn on less than 1 year after i got it   i have had previous hair dryers for years with no problems   this is not an expensive hair dryer so it was great while it lasted   i am giving it two stars because it didn t last    while it worked  i d give it a 5  this is just what a hair dryer should be  out of the way when not in use  easy and powerful  i just bought three more  one for work  i am a barber  one for my other bathroom and a spare  i just bought this dryer a couple weeks ago  i really like it  it dries my hair quickly and it does not leave my hair frizzy   the only thing i would change is the on off button  i hit that often causing it to shut off  awesome hair dryer this is not a cheap one from your local variety store well built works great worth every pennie and then some great buy  i got this blower dryer for christmas after i had picked it out and had it on my wish list   i decided to make sure it worked before i threw away all the packaging   as soon as i turned it on there was a funny burning smell   i ran it for about 30 seconds on high and turned it off and smoke came out of the barrel   i waited about five minutes and tried it again  same thing happened  i rarely leave reviews  but i have used my new hairdryer 4 times now and i am amazed   the power  the smooth sounds  the quality and results are amazing   my hair came out so smooth i thought that perhaps i put too much product in my hair  and i almost thought that the product made my hair a tad oily   nope that s just the natural shine   wow   my husband did a great job when he overheard me shopping at bed and beyond one day and i was admiring the expensive hair dryers   he paid attention and researched and voila    a wonderful and very thoughtful christmas present   less time  less frustration and feeling a little bit prettier in the mornings is well worth the money   thank you fhi  this is a nice hair dryer  like that is has three blower settings  works well on my think long hair  easy grip handle  bought this item and didnt use it for another two or three weeks after purchase  but when i did    omg i totally love it  nice price and its a nice soft pink  looks great and feels great  that i want to wash and dry my hair everyday   its quiet  easy to handle and work with  totally love it   this is a great hair dryer  unlike some of the reviews i do not feel it is heavy  but i have always used a full sized dryer as opposed to some of the more compact ones out there in the market  i did have to get used to the switch placement the first couple of times i used it  and the nozzles can be difficult to turn if they are put  on too tight  but these are minor adjustments one has to make while getting used to a new product      my hair is noticeably straighter and very soft since starting to use this dryer  i don t necessarily feel it dries my hair any quicker than my old one  did  but the end results are definitely  better  my first thought when i pulled it out of the box was that it was very stylish  i love the pink  it is very professional looking indeed  br    br   i like the dryer has a nice long cord  as almost every dryer i have ever owned have had short chords  br    br   this hairdryer is  really powerful  i have short hair and the dryer dried my hair rather quickly  the two attachments the dryer comes with were easy to place on and remove  br    br   there are three heat and two speed selections  i found the  highest heat setting very hot  but it would be perfect for someone with long thick hair  the medium setting works well for my short hair  br    br   i have two minor complaints with the dryer  the weight of the dryer is a little heavier than i m use to and  my 2nd complaint is with the placement of the controls  it made it kind of hard to hold and dry my hair  as i was trying hard not to accidentally change the settings  br    br   that will just take some getting use to on my part  br    br   overall  the remington ac2015 tstudio salon collection pearl ceramic hair dryer is a great product and certainly worth the price  love this product  i bought this because of the great reviews   i color my hair  to cover gray  and blow drying always takes too long and hair looks dry and have some sticking up all over   i bought this and omg     it took half the time to dry and no fly away hair    i have gotten so many compliments   i loved it but never thought anyone would notice   i really do get such nice compliments   remember i am over the hill and hair seems to get dryer with the years and coloring doesn t help that except cover the gray which i am so happy for that   but if you feel your hair is getting too dry and or frizzy  fly away hair     this will take care of it  its a one time purchase and so worth it   3 temperatures and a cool button which i love   what can i say  oh it is not all that heavy  regular weight as other unless you want a little blow and a lot of noise from a much cheaper hair blower   been there done that    this is the bomb     don t waste more time or money on frustrating hair blowers  be good to yourself and buy this awesome hair blower       take care and you will not regret it for one second  i found it very hard to buy a blow dryer on line but after some research and talking with my hair stylist i decided to purchase the fhi nano   i couldn t be happier with this product   the best feature is the three heat options   this dryer really does leave your hair looking silky and healthy   you definately will see a big difference compared to the cheaper dryers   if you need to replace your dryer this is worth the money  i had the perfect blowdryer    that was until i moved  nonetheless  i was pretty worried about getting a new one  i have been through a fair share of terrible no good hair dryers  looove this one  it s lightweight  only 1 7 lbs compared to some that are 2 5 or even 3  i like that it has a retractable cord  which will make for easier traveling  that goes for the folding handle as well  the high is actually really high powered  i was surprised  and the settings are perfect  in my opinion  the warm isn t too hot  like some i ve experienced   amazing   i highly recommend this blow dryer  not only does it dry my hair in a fraction of the time but it leaves nice and shiny  i feel like i had it professional styled  i have long straight brown hair so flyaways and frizzies are usually a huge issue  but not with this dryer    the first impression from the wife on this one was that it looked  pretty   the hair dryer actually is brownish with pink details  contrary to what the pictures on this page may suggest  black  it has a very  girlie  elegant look  so the first impression was great  br    br   after using it for a while you can clearly tell this is designed for heavy duty  my wife owns a conair hair dryer and this one is definitely quieter then the conair one and more potent  it is indeed heavier but at the same time slim  basically it is not a big hair dryer but it is heavier than your average ones  not a big deal but worth mentioning  it has two speed settings you can use and three different temperature settings  br    br   bottom line  a very  professional  hair dryer  better than the old conair the wife will no longer use  additionally an accessory to give volume to the hair is included  i love this hair dryer so much  i got online to review it     of all the dryers i ve owned  including a t3  this one dries the fastest and leaves my hair smooth not frizzed   i m not saying it s going to perform miracles and turn a rat s nest into a pantene commercial  but i use to run my straightening iron through my hair just to smooth it out a bit more  and i don t feel the need to do that anymore  the remington ac2015 is a good hair dryer with a reasonable price point that will get the job done for which it is intended  drying hair   the hair dryer itself is very sturdy  and a bit heavier than most  and the controls are easy to use   but is it possible that a hair dryer can actually have too much power behind the air flow   if so  this hair dryer would fit the bill    the remington is a work horse of a hair dryer that has so much power for air velocity it was almost more than i would have preferred   it blew my hair in just about every direction imaginable  and it blew papers on the ledge in my bathroom all around the room   so therein lies what might be a potential issue with the hair dryer   if you are a person who likes to style your hair with the help of your hair dryer  it might be a challenge to find a setting to do that   while using the high speed setting on the hair dryer  with a round brush  my hair tended to blow around too much  and made it hard to control the hair in the brush   the low setting was a better option  however  when i chose to use the cool shot option to set the hair  it made the hair dryer speed go faster  and blew more air than if you left the button untouched   i am not sure why the airflow would increase when you hit the cool shot button  but that is what happened every time i pushed it   it almost seems to be an engineering oversight   anyway  after a few days  i gave up on the remington  for styling specific challenges only  and went back to using my tourmaline tools hair dryer  which i like very much   if ever there is a time i just need a quick blow dry  i would certainly reach for this hair dryer  and it is more than suitable for general every day use  web site description adequate and accurate  delivery timely  mounting straight forward  lo speed   lo heat  hi speed   hi heat  both appropriately matched  insertion into and release from wall mount easy  noise level comparable to other mfgrs  units i ve used at my gym  in service less than 1 month so can t comment on durability  does an excellent job of making my lazy crew cut stand up  i ve owned a lot of hairdryers in my time  who hasn t    and this is the first one i can ever recall wanting to review   i had to buy a new dryer because i left my other one at mom s   knowing i d be home to collect that one  which came from a beauty supply store and works well   i grabbed this one  cheaply  at target  i think i more or less chose it because it was cute  but i ve wound up loving it for more practical reasons   i very much prefer it to the one it replaced   one reason is tactile  it has a nice almost soft finish that s comfortable to touch or hold   ergonomically  it simply feels right in my hand   it s very well balanced   the cool air option works great  far cooler air  esp for a sustained time  than any other dryer i ve owned   the air opening is a little bit smaller than average  so it provided well directed air    there is also a good diffuser included if you need to diffuse rather than direct    provides a good and shiny and smooth blow out   quickly   even on cool air  the cord is not retractible  but is is a good length and doesn t seem to tangle easily   i would recommend this product  this is perfect  i love that it is really strong  my hair gets dry pretty fast  i also like the 3 different intensities  this item looks very fancy and useful to use in multiple level using cooling and light enough to use  i will buy this product again    i would expect a coil cord to re coil   this does not   it stretched and re coiled about 50  on the first try  i did not over do it   i went about 3 feet at most  i can tell by closer examination that it would only get more stretched  what is the point of a coiled cord   i could simply use a regular dryer with a hook   i had not mounted it but had one person hold it against the wall for placement evaluation   not to test the cord   i am returning this defective product  my hairdresser recommended this dryer   he works in hollywood and does the hair and wigs of many ladies you have heard of   this dryer is awesome   does a great job   just don t drop it   i dropped mine one too many times and had to buy another one which i quickly did   now i put a towel in the sink and put the dryer in the sink while i m futzing with my hair so it won t slip off the counter   it s so great i am getting my mom one for christmas whether she needs it or not  great item  lots of power came with a great price point and very fast shipping  i m completely satisfied  thanks for offering this fine item  at first they were very good but now they don t  last very long before they burn out  replacements are sent but the same thing happens  i would not recommend at this point  since this is a christmas present for my granddaughter  i have no idea how great it is but it has been on her wish list for a long time  the service i received though was wonderful  don t waste your money  i was two inches away from a girl and nothing  i m in college and even in class it did nothing  and i put it on right before class  i ve had this one  non refurbished  for five years now and only the trimmer has broken  i bought it for around  15 back in 2005  gives a good clean shave  i m going to try a newer model now if i can find one at a decent price  with my greasy face  the original gold colored acne wash cut through the sludge with a single pump of soap   this new version requires 2 pumps  but smells 100x better   i think the better smell is worth the extra soap  i bought the 4 pack skin79 sampler and of all the 4 items there  this is the one that worked best for me  br    br   about me   i am se asian  about medium toned compared to most native se asians  with about nc30 skin minus the heavy yellow undertones   i tan easily in summer and probably cannot use this product  maybe can if i have the right powder to put over it   will have to try    though i would use it in winter fall   i have combo oily skin and rarely break out   i am in my mid 30 s  br    br   about this product   this product oxidizes a bit when put on   at first  it leaves somewhat of a greyish cast but i think this neutralizes yellowish asian undertones once product settles into skin   later skin79 gold adjusts a bit to my skin color though i think it is a tad light for me   i think longevity is about 3 4 hours with primer so i put a finishing powder  drugstore brand  over it so it would last 6 8hrs   using a powder similar to your coloring will help make this skin79 product  match up  to ur skin coloring  if you are about nc30 or more    i really think powdering is a must for this product   honestly  i have to have powder for this or it wont last long and coloring looks  a bit off   it isnt drying  and u dont become  oily  after several hours  not quite dewy but healthy moisturized skin    you never feel u r wearing makeup with this on  even with primer   bb cream  powder   br    br   compared to other products   i feel it does  brighten  the face a bit compared to the other skin79 sampler items   i found oriental bb gold too oily at the end of day  though loved its initial dewiness    pink one made my skin look dead and didnt last long and blemish diamond bb cream was too sparkly to use   i have also used sephora and laura merceir oil less tinted moisturizer and found these too oily and  dead looking  respectively on my skin   laura mercier brand oxidized way too much for me and made me feel like i was wearing a fake mask at end of the day  i even tried 2 3 different shades     christian dior tm broke me out as well as the other skin79 items esp  oriental bb gold  br    br   this is a good product to be honest   despite of the minor negatives above esp  not matching to skin color and lack of longetivity without use of powder   i really think this works great with powder atop of it  br    br   if i get a chance will post comparable pics here in amazon shades     christian dior tm broke me out as well as the other skin79 items esp  oriental bb gold     this is a good product to be honest   despite of the minor negatives above esp  not matching to skin color and lack of longetivity without use of powder    i really think this works great with powder atop of it        if i get a chance will post comparable pics here in amazon  i put this product on around 5 am before i went to school it stayed on most of the day  by around 9 pm the winged cat eye i had made with this eyeliner had faded somewhat  then when i went to remove the product i found it rather easy  even though it is supposed to be waterproof  it came off easily with a tissue and some water  i love the product though  very pigmented  this cologne is the epitamy of class   you feel like a million bucks when you wear this stuff even if your dirt poor   last a long time and has good projection  a winner for sure  when my bottle runs out i will definetly buy more  this is the first straightener i have used  so i can t compare to others   i can attest to the fact that i have medium length  moderately curly hair and i am able to straighten my hair with one pass at 410  although for a more polished look i do two passes   i am able to get two days out of my style without any signifigant frizz   however  it is fall and the humidity level is pretty low   my only real complaint is the instructions state to hold the   key to lock the buttons   after some trial and error i figured out that holding the   key actually acheived this   feel like it is a good value  this is a fabulous top coat  we use it at my cosmetology school along with opi nail polish and it s the perfect combo  definitely recommend it  i am notorious for screwing my nails up right after the hard work i put into doing them  so if you re like that    get it  this is a great price for it too  i ordered two of these and returned them immediately  the suction cups are placed too far apart and will not stay stuck on the tub when i place my head there  if this problem is rectified  it will be a good product  i have used pillows of this style for years with excellent results  these have a flaw in their design which renders them useless  this flat iron is hands down the best i have ever owned   works fantastic and gets my hair pin straight   i love venus dreams body chai   i have very dry skin and use body chai after showering and at night before i go to bed  i particularly like it for my feet and elbows   it is creamy  smooth  and absorbs perfectly  and the smell is divine   just right this is a teriffic product  i was seeing lines  road maps   in my face and i put the oil on after cleansing my face and then cover that with collegen cream and bingo   i could see a difference in about a week   love it  smells great  goes very well with like daytime and casual stuff  only thing i have against it is that its refreshing smell reminds me of soap  like it is made by irish spring  as far as wound care goes  this tape is mediocre at best   the tiniest amount of sweat or moisture on the skin causes it to peel right off  rendering it fairly useless for holding a dressing in place     the one area where this tape really shines  however  is in binding orchestral sheet music parts   the 1 micropore tape is absolutely the best solution i ve found for taping orchestral music parts together   it sticks just enough to hold the pages together perfectly  yet not so much that it can t be repositioned without destroying your parts   it s extremely thin  easy to tear to length  folds perfectly  and doesn t stretch at all   it s about as sticky as masking tape  but much thinner and much stronger     i m constantly being complimented on how my parts are bound  and it has everything to do with this tape     stop using scotch or masking tape    and buy this immediately   you will not be disappointed  the andis rc 2 hairdryer cuts my drying time in half  i leave the dryer on my dressing table without retracting the cord   for travel  the cord has retracted with a little bit of help but it is not a problem   i first used this hairdryer at the marriott marquis in nyc and knew then that i had to purchase one   a great value for the job that it does   it s cheap and it works   what s not to love  full power is pretty strong and gets my hair dry within minutes  the heat is at a good level  not too hot and not cold  there s also a cool button in case you want cool air for a moment  it s also very light  which makes it easier to use and hold  especially if you have crazy hair like i do  some people have said it s loud  which is true  but it s not much louder than most other hairdryers  i haven t tried the attachments  overall  it s a good hairdryer and i would buy it again  i ve always been a fan of conair dryers  but this is the best one that i have ever owned   i really like the easy open lint catcher and the super strong air flow   it takes no time at all to dry my hair and the frizziness is greatly reduced   highly recommended  this was my first ionic dryer  and it dried my hair very well and quickly  although i have short hair    i only had two problems with it  but these were enough for me to return it       its size when folded up is a bit too big for travel   i fly frequently  and the space in my luggage is precious   this took up about the same space as a pair of shoes     the cord did not retract smoothly or reliably   i would often have to pull it out again in order to have it retract fully     good concept  but unfortunately it s going back  i could not find a hair dryer less than 1850 watts in any stores  so searched the net and found this one   it s great and doesn t blow the fuse in my bathroom  i have an older home with 15 amp fuses   my old hair dryer finally gave out and it was also a 1200 watt and now it seemed like no one made anything less than 1850 watts   this is a wonderful little dryer   a space saver and does the job  since when did you notice how good the hair dryer in your hotel was   i recently stayed at the buckhead ritz carlton and the most impressive thing was the hair dryer   i could not believe how different my hair was  no friz  smooth and silky   i actually wrote down the name and info about the hair dryer and ordered from amazon   the hair dryer is great   so good that i ordered the flat iron too   great find  i now have the ritz of hair dryers  i got this dryer for christmas last year  and i absolutley loved it  i didn t find it too heavy  it was quiet  and my hair felt great after drying it  only thing i didn t care for was how hot the attachments got after using  other than that i loved this hair dryer    but dang it  in october i took it with me to tahoe for a wedding  and the dang thing just quit working  i was soooo dissappointed  i had to use those cheapo hair dryers that the hotels put in  i m sorry but 9 months  maybe 3 days a week of use and it dies     what s up with that  if it had not died in such a critical moment  i would have given 5 stars  i purchased my previous dryer from my stylist but it was so heavy i quit using it   the pearl ceramic dryer has the same features but is considerably lighter and works wonders with my naturally curly hair   it dries my hair really quickly and that is what we use them for  especially in southern humidity  both the diffuser and the air concentrator are useful for various styles   i use a little wax mousse and presto  i highly recommend it  super easy to mount  great the cord does not coil because it would get tangled easily  a tad bit noisy but that s what a hair dryer is  loud  i recommend to all  yes  this looks like a hair dryer from a hotel and i wouldn t be surprised if a lot of hotels used this   it s well built and light weight   nothing fancy   on off  high low air and heat  this is a great hair dryer that styles my hair well and reduces frizz flyaways   it s 2 heat settings  plus cool blast button enable me to round brush my hair even when it s almost dry   my only complaint is that the buttons are in a weird place so i accidently hit the hot warm switch or turn it off while drying my hair  this dryer is great   especially for the price   easy to mount   two settings high is hot and blows hard and low is significantly cooler and blows rather soft   i am not a real glam girl so the settings work for me  while this dryer does a nice job of keeping frizz away  it takes forever to dry my thick  shoulder length hair with it   even when i ve used the highest settings on it  it takes me twice as long to dry my hair with this remington than it does with my   asin b003521ca2 conair 259 infiniti pro ac motor styling tool  orange     i have wavy curly hair  so i usually use a diffuser  but i ve tried this both with the diffuser and without it  and each time it s taken me awhile to dry my hair  br    br   some other pros of this dryer are that it has a nice feel to it  the material that it s made out of has a pearlescent  matte finish   isn t too heavy  so your arm doesn t get too tired while holding it   and comes with some nice attachments   the diffuser  though  has prongs that are asymmetrical in length  so it takes awhile to get used to using it  br    br   since many of the other reviews are glowing and say that this dryer dries in record time  i m wondering if i received a defective unit  as i mentioned  it does cut down on frizz  but i prefer my conair for a faster drying time  the folding handle and the retractable cord make this a great travel dryer   plenty of power and yet easy to store   definitely a good buy   have used it for about 6 months and works great  br   2013   still going strong  the retractable cord is not retracting as well as it previously did but the dryer unit works perfectly  i have to admit  as a guy with short hair  i do not use a hair dryer very often   however  i am all too familiar with the noise they make when my wife is drying her hair in the morning   to me  her 10 year old hair dryer sounds like a mini jet engine   i asked her to give this hair dryer a try  br    br   the first thing i noticed is that the hair dryer did not wake me up in the morning when my wife was drying her hair   the hair dryer does not have that high pitch noise that makes it sound like a jet engine   it makes a noise that i have not heard in a hair dryer before   i would call it more of a low roar versus the high shriek of the older models  br    br   my wife was very impressed with the effectiveness of the dryer   she said that it dried her hair in about half the time as her old dryer  br    br   the dryer does feel like it was build solid   the outside casing has a rubbery type feel as opposed to the hard smooth plastic most dryers are made of  br    br   my wife is thrilled with how fast it dries her hair   personally  i love the fact that it is quiet and doesn t wake me up in the morning when she dries her hair  i work the graveyard shift so this is important to me    so far  this is an excellent product and i would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone  mine worked fine for a while  i ve had it about a year but i didn t use it all that much until about a 2 months ago  after about a month the little plastic piece that you push to retract the cord broke so now no retractable cord  i liked that feature for easy storage  so far everything else still works  i ll keep you posted  bought this as a replacement for an earlier version of the same thing   the button that you press to start the cord retraction is placed at the widest part of the unit  by necessity  and it got shaved off when closing the vanity drawer so i could no longer retract the cord   other than this inherent drawback  i love that the cord retracts for safety neatness space saving  etc   dries efficiently without being smoking hot  i gave this dryer to the missus to try  since she uses one everyday and tears through one or two a year  i figured she d be the perfect person to rate this against a number of other dryers  here s what she said  br    br   first of all  this hair dryer looks sleek  chocolate brown with powder pink accents  and it doesn t look bad or distracting just sitting by the sink or on the dresser   some huge salon models that look like they power wind tunnels are much more obtrusive   this one is rather long and slightly heavier  however  than the con air infinity hair dryer i ve been using  so it took a little getting used to the heft  the noise level is average  the same as con air   but it dries my hair much faster and seems like it gives more volume to my hair  the speed also allows me to style my hair better and it stays that way longer  while most blow dryers have multiple settings  this remington really has noticeable differences between the settings  with warm being warm and hot actually being hot instead of a little warmer  the selection switches on this model are also much easier to change to get to those settings  and unlike most slide switch type models  they can be changed on the fly while styling without having to fumble and fret with the dryer  no doubt about it  i m completely satisfied with this dryer  br    br   so of course  we give it five stars  the is one of the best blow dryer ever  i lov it i would recomended it to everyone   try it you too will love it    i had a conair hair dryer for about 10 years before it died on me a few weeks ago  i decided on this revlon hair dryer for features including the retractable cord and folding handle among others  seemed like a great price for a decent hair dryer  it dries my hair fine but i cannot stand the on off switches  they don t slide up and down easily and i often have to wedge something underneath the slide to get it to turn on  drives me nuts  i don t recommend this dryer for that reason  i bought this hair dryer to replace one that i borrowed from a friend that burnt out because i used the electric converter incorrectly  because the price was so reasonable and because i had to reach  25 for free shipping  i bought two and kept one for myself  i use this dryer every day and couldn t be happier with it  my hair is somewhat long  little below shoulders  and this dryer is light  powerful  and drys my hair quickly  it would make a terrific travel dryer  it works much better than those found in most hotel rooms  at this price you can t go wrong  the fact that it has the dual voltage is a nice plus  the hair dryer has a number of settings and will allow you to have very cool air or very hot air   it is quite powerful and gets my long hair dry in less time than other dryers i have had in the past   it is a little heavy and i definitely would not refer to it as compact   it s about the same size as a standard dryer you might get at a drug store and it s heavier as well   overall  i m very pleased with it and hope it lasts a very long time  i installed this little hair dryer because i was tired of the hair dryer and cord laying on my sink and counter    it always seemed to be in the way   my concerns that this hair dryer was not powerful enough turned out to be for naught   excellent hair dryer  plenty of power and a lower setting for those who like to take twice as long with their hair  like my gf    easy to mount    love the hook to hang the cord on  i bought the conair blackbird to replace a similar older model that i had for many years   i know that there a lot of new tech hair dryers out there  for my needs  i didn t need the new technology   i wanted to replace my old conair with a powerful and modern version of the original   i m very pleased with the blackbird   i m a male and only blow dry my hair a couple of times a week   i don t have to use the hottest setting and get great results at a lesser heat level   the higher heat settings would be perfect for a woman with long hair   this hair dryer is very powerful and i do a lot of styling on the cool setings as well           this is the first time i ve reviewed a product   i m so pleased with the blackbird that i wanted to share   starlight i ve been using these powerful little dryers about 15 years because they fit nicely on the side of my vanity under an extended countertop  the only problem is that they only last about 1 1 2 to 2 years with 2 people using them daily   but the price is right  i really am very pleased with my purchase of the conair 225rx tourmaline ceramic 1875 watt hair drier   it dries my daughter s long thick hair much faster than my old drier   it produces a nice strong hot breeze  yet it doesn t get too hot that she complains of it burning her  on lower heat seting    her hair seems shinier too   whole family loves it     highly recommend it   the price was reasonable also    i was looking for something compact and light weight and this was smaller than i expected it to be  does a great job in drying my hair quickly  the high mode is a bit loud but if you don t want to use high  the low option works good too  i ve only had this hair dryer about a month but so far it is excellent   it is very powerful and  dries my long hair  complete with styling it  in under 10 minutes   my only complaint is the location of the on off switch as it s easy to accidentally turn it off while using it  my hair dresser first started me on a t3 about 4 years ago  i loved it  when it began to loose power  i found another t3 on amazon and am still a t3 fan  i highly recommend this blow dryer   well worth the money  the product works very well and is priced modestly   i like having it mounted on the wall and then it isn t on the counter   it has three heat settings and two speeds  this is the second jerdon wall mount hair dryer i have purchased  i gave this hair dryer to my mom last christmas  it is the best i have ever used  i don t even use my hair dryer anymore because i love this dryer so much  it dries my hair in what feels like 1 minute  it has three heat settings instead of two  which is nice  this is probably better than the hair dryer my hair dresser uses in her salon  i highly recommend this    i purchased this bonnet hair dryer at a fabulous price and overall  it meets my needs   it heats up very quickly and is quite powerful for such a compact size  mine does not shut off automatically  as some have stated  the only complaint that i have is the bonnet would not fit over my rollers  no matter what i did to adjust it   i ended up having to use the bonnet from my old lazy dazy dryer  the hose is also a bit difficult to wind up and store in the unit  by the way  conair is very good at replacing defective products if you contact a customer service supervisor by phone   i love this compact hair dryer  the reason the price is so low is that this is a cheap knock off and not a real bespoke labs blow dryer  mine stopped working after 9 mths and there is no warranty  you get what you pay for i guess  this is for all you dog bathers  i wanted a dryer that would  match  some of the over priced professional pet dryers   this is perfect  it  blows very fast or slow  it s also very lightweight  on cool and warm it s not  too hot   and it s very quiet compared to  all of the dryers i ve ever used  so if you re looking for a dryer for your dog or cat  you won t be  disappointed  and if you happen to  need it for you re own hair it s just fine  basically it s good  but you can buy a bigger one at the same price at drug store i love this item have no complaints about it  it dryes my hair just the way i want it to do it  is hot but no burnng  my only problem is that i want to bring this blower on my trips to india  and it doesnt really work there cause of the voltage  i got to useit the last time   i didnt really investigate about the voltage there   so i had to use adapters and it didnt really give me it 100   once i got back from india and i started using it here it was just awsome  i wish i can find the same one or a similar one   please help i need to find the item but with 220 or 240 instead of the 125v that it is now  can you recomend any item   i like the simple design and compact size of this hair dryer  only the low heat switch of the hairdryer was burned out the first time i turned it on   the replaced hairdryer is working so far so good  the hair dryer works very well to dry hair fast without harsh heat  you can see the difference in stying compared to a traditional hair dryer  my stylist recommended this model to me   she s used them  and others  in salons for many years and mentioned this one as a sound hair dryer   i needed one at school after i started growing my hair out again  so i looked online for this model     pros    classic design substantial housing  has the potential to last years   multiple heat settings and fan speeds   longer cord than most  8 feet instead of 6 feet    low noise  more like a whoosh than a wine  shouldn t wake neighbors if you re in a dorm apartment situation     cons    heat settings are distinctive but not straightforward nor precise      overall  i feel like i got a very good product at a great price   i would buy it again  though not if it doesn t last   i ve only had it for two days and it seems to be doing well  i have always had difficulty using the round brush and a normal hair dryer to straighten my hair   my arms would get so tired   with the andis 82105 ceramic ionic styler hair dryer  i am able to make my spiral curl hair straight in 1 2 the time that it used to   i have been getting so many compliments on my hair since i bought it  this dryer works really well  just like the ones in salons  it can get hot in there  but its the same hotness   you would experience in a salon  heat can be controlled by how deep you stick your head in there  cord does get   a little warm  but this doesn t seem to be any type of safety issue  this dryer makes it so that you can easily  watch tv or read a magazine while drying your hair  i use them for my dreadlocks and it works great   the heat and power is good  but in keeps shutting off in certain outlets of the house  i had this hair dryer for less than 1 year  the other day it starting shorting out and then suddenly sparks starting flying out of the spot where the cord enters the handle of the dryer  melting part of the cord  fortunately  nothing caught fire  i replaced the dryer with a non revlon product  i bought this blow dryer for my camper   it is perfect   it s compact  hangs on the wall  not loud and does the job   i would recommend this product for campers  boats  etc   i will buy another when i burn this one out   a girl s hair still has to look good  even when you re camping  this hair dryer works fine   it has several settings that are good as well   the only problem that i see with the hairdryer is that the switches are located on the handle and as your hand wraps around to hold the dryer  you inadvertently shut it off   it s annoying but i feel as though it s just something i will get used to in time   everything else about it is     so far  so good  i ve owned various blowdryers through the years  but this one is my favorite by far  it s relatively lightweight  though i wouldn t say it s featherweight  but it is quite a bit lighter than most dryers on the market   dries hair faster than any other dryer i ve used  and generally creates smoother  shinier results  i love that you can pop off the back and replace clean the little air filter  since most of my dryers in the past lost power over time because the filter got clogged with dust and i couldn t clean it      after my most recent cut my stylist gave me a blowout with this dryer  so i knew it was reliable  the way i see it  i wear my hair every day and it surrounds my face  so it s worth investing in a tool that will give me consistently great results that improve my appearance  i highly recommend this dryer     and by the way  i purchased it from someone on amazon who was selling a new one for about a hundred dollars  it was a great value and i ve had no problems with it  the attachment to the hair bonnet does not hold well   other than that  i m happy with the purchase  it worked ok in the first 5 uses and the it just fell apart till it died  when working heat in the bonnet was not equally distributed  this dryer is quiet   effective  especially for the price  i m very happy with it  buyer beware    this hair dryer has four settings   off  low  no heat   scorch and torch  a most disappointing purchase from hot tools   there is a positive  the bonnet is much better than one from a prior hot tools purchase  hoping for a short life span for this hair dryer  so that i can buy another brand  i love this blow dryer   it gets my hair dried fast and has different temperature settings and even a cool blast button   for those going natural this is a great choice   not much to say here     this is a small hair dryer perfect for travel  i wanted it to keep in our rv   i have a lot of hair and it s completely dry in 4 minutes with this little guy   very happy with the purchase  this is the best hair dryer  i usually go for cheap or easy to travel with hair dryers  but decided to try a fair priced ionic hair dryer to protect my hair  i m so glad i did   this dryer dries my long hair in about 5 7 minutes and leaves it straight and smooth  i hardly have to use my flat irons  which saves my hair even more from heat damage  i am very satisfied with this purchase  sometimes the smallest things make the biggest difference  light weight  effective hairdryer  like the folding handle for travel and storage purposes  retractable cord nice feature  wish it had a cool setting or cold shot button  overall  great dryer at a terrific price  i researched many sites and brands before i purchased this hair dryer  i must admit i was initially attracted to the red color but then was impressed with the other attributes  my hair is relatively short and fine  i need a dryer to help give my hair body and this one does it very well  i like the attatchment that can be used as a comb since it can be used with one hand  i recently had elbow surgery so this enables me to dry my hair with one hand  it is heavy enough to feel substantial but light enough that i am comfortable using it in my non dominant hand  this little hair dryer was just what i was looking for   it is small and light weight  just right for me   i also wanted a dryer that was low amperage as my old one kept blowing the circuit  all in all a great price  too  i am a flight attendant and this travel dryer is powerful   better than any hotel hair dryer   i love it and it s cheap  i like it so much  even the button is kind of easy to accidently push  but i don t think it s a big deal  i recommend this dryer 100   really a good product  i dried my hair in only 20 minutes and the appearance was shinny and straight  this hair dryer is the best i have ever owned  i do not think that it is too heavy  or has a short cord  or too loud   it all worked out for me  the heat is not as hot as plastic dryers  and i did not have frizz  it held my style in place   i gave it 5 stars because i am am very pleased with this purchase  i am very happy with this hair dryer  its light weight  poweful  but doesn t burn the hair  a great buy for any professional  great product   does exactly what i wanted it to do and easy to mount on the wall   perfect for guest bathroom  this is a great little dryer   i have fine hair and it s nice that on low it has a nice gentle blow speed and temperature  pros  good quality  comfortable to hold in hand    cons  the plug is bulky  seems to be true for all hair dryers though  and the switch is a little difficult to operate  bought this hair dryer for our trip to italy   perfect traveling size  but when using the 250 voltage setting   only the high speed worked   it got way too hot on that setting to use comfortably   i ended up not being able to use it because it burned my skin and blew my hair too hard to style it   i started washing my hair at night and letting it air dry   the low and high settings work fine in the states on the other voltage  but it was a waste to buy it specifically for the dual voltage piece and then not be able to use it anyway  bought this together with the other andis tourmaline model  this one is for my daughter  the hairdryer is powerful yet light and we love the retractable cord  it stores away neatly in the bathroom cabinet  we have been using these andis hairdryers daily for 2 years now and both are still going strong  i have never heard of this brand until i used this in a luxury hotel   i was so impressed with the performance and design of the item that i searched for it online when we got home  for the price  design and performance  this is a great buy  bought this on amazon 2 years ago and it is still going strong  i never heard of this brand before i saw it in a luxury hotel  i was so impressed with the power and design of the hair dryer that when my conair died  i searched for andis online and found it here  the overall item is well made and solid  the gorgeous deep red color is very rich and boy is it powerful  i use it to dry my hair daily and it has held up well  there is a heft to the item and does not feel cheap or plastic ky like my old conair  the andis also comes with a nice long cord but i did wish it retracts to make storage neater  i am giving this a 4 star because of that  very cool and sleak design that i expect from bed head   my hair drys quick and the ions leave it smooth  shiny  and less  fried     awesome dryer    i was so lucky to find this wonderful dryer with diffuser  you see i had one for 20 years  and it finally blew up  i had loved it so much i had to find another one  i was so happy with my purchase  i use it about 10 to 15 times a day  i am a professional hairdresser and have to have good equipment  thank you for my dryer  bonnet size is perfect  20 minutes is enough to get my hair dry  it s not noisy  it work very well and never turn off   bought it was a good decision  i use it while i watch tv or read  love it   keeps counter space clean  but yet the dryer is handy to use  still can t get a handle on this product            can t seem to get it to hold standing position on a counter top               holds great on a mirror  i got this blow dryer and returned it within a week  it s a cute dryer  but when i turned it on high and shut it off it would smoke  it wouldn t do it on low  but i still felt it was unsafe  it could have just been the dryer that i got  just be aware if you purchase one  no bells and whistles on this hairdryer   just an excellent product  very powerful and light to hold  it arrived very promptly and i recommend it  having baby fine hair and not a lot of it  i find my hair feels more dry and brittle after using this dryer for the last month   there are 3 speeds and 3 heat settings  the 1st heat setting being cool  the 1st speed setting is too low even for my hair  the highest speed and heat settings are way to strong and burning hot for my head  the switch placement is a pain as you have to be careful not to accidently hit them when holding the handle  i don t think this dryer is worth its higher price  i was skeptical about buying such an expensive hair dryer  however  my best friend had one and i tried it on a trip  i thought i liked it but still wasn t sure about spending the money  my stylist let one of the other girls dry my hair one day  she used one when drying my hair  i commented on how soft and smooth my hair was  i usually get my hair flat ironed to get the same effect  she didn t have to  i called my girlfriend to see if her hair dryer was the same brand and it was  so i bought one  i love it and haven t flat ironed my hair yet  the only thing i was dissapointed in was that the warranty doesn t apply to the purchases from amzon  i just hope it lasts for a long time so i don t feel cheated  overall i am very impressed  i didn t realize that a hair dryer can make such a difference in your hair  i say go for it  i love it  it gets the job done   it was inexpensive and jsut as powerful as my other hair dryers   i recommend it for anyone  i bought this dryer expected outstanding results   it performs no better than any hairdryer i have had   matter of fact  maybe not as good   it does not have the blowing power that my   revlon has  and is not any lighter   i don t know what all the hype is about this one   save your money and get a  30 one  i found out they are just as good  great compact design  i love the cord hanger  the light is pretty bright  but exactly as advertised  it does take longer to dry my hair but it is doing less damage     doesn t get hot enough to style my hair   it dries it  and leaves it frizz free  but it just doesn t get hot enough to shorten my drying time or omit the need for straightening iron   it is nicely designed and really light weight  but it just didn t do the job   i m returning mine  don t let its small size fool you  this blow dryer is one of the best available at major retailers today  when i went shopping for a new blow dryer  this one actually looked sturdier than its bulkier  more expensive conair cousins  with their breakable diffusers and fragile looking reset buttons  the d5000 s compact size makes it easy to hold  and it won t take up much space on on your bathroom counter when you re done with it  although it s touted as a travel dryer  i find that it makes a great daily styling tool  drying my damp hair in just a few minutes  caveat  i have fine  medium length hair  so someone with longer or thicker hair might need something more heavy duty   br    br   my only complaint about this dryer is that it s kind of loud  granted  it is still an improvement over my old sunbeam blow dryer  which sounded like demons being released from the bowels of hell when i turned it on  with the remington  i find that wearing earplugs reduces the noise to an acceptable level  with that said  i do have sensitive hearing  so a normal person may not have a problem with the noise  br    br   if this hair dryer lasts as long as my last one  which i owned for about five years  then i will be satisfied  i ve had this dryer for five years and have used it everyday  it s still working like new  br   it retracts nicely and fits great into my bathroom drawer  this hairdryer is ok   i like some aspects of it such as being able to adjust the heat and air level  but i don t think that this dries my hair any faster than the other cheaper hair dryer that i have   i also feel the weight on my arms that other reviewers were discussing   i am not sure that it has had any effect on the level of shine or frizz in my hair although being able to adjust the level of heat and air has probably helped in terms of being able to prevent heat damage   i think it is an ok hair dryer but i would not buy it again  i did not return it mostly because of the hassle of repackaging and sending it back  bought this dual voltage drier for my trip to europe  dried my hair quickly  was compact for travel  used low setting only based on prior reviews  great dryer but loud  we have had this hairdryer slightly over a month and now it only works at low speed  when it worked  it worked great  but just a month before a problem  unacceptable at any price  i place my order on wednesday september 1st and i was shocked that i already got it today september 4th  i am very pleased with them because i need it the item right away and i got it without paying extra money for rush delivery   i won t think twice to buy again from them and i would definately recomend them to everybody   excellent packing and professionally well done    two thumbs up and five stars  this is the best hair dryer i have ever owned   it cuts drying time to my longish highlighted blonde hair way down and makes my hair smooth  shiny and frizz free  my hair looks like i just left the salon everyday  the hair dryer design itself is good  but the material the cord is made out of is cheap   after 5 months of daily use  it lost its connection within the wiring  near the end of the plug   since it s more than 60 days  i can t return it to the store   and since it costs me money to ship it back to conair  and i have to include another  5 00 for their shipping an new on back to me  i think i ll just toss it in the trash   i will not waste my time or more money on conair  this is my second purchase of this dryer the first one lasted for about 10 years   the newer model is great i would highly recommend it as i have to many friends  hi gang   i just threw this hair dryer away after having it for about two years  it has begun to smoke and smell horrible  i did some research and found out that bespoke will do anything to get out of a warranty for this thing  if you bought it here at amazon they won t touch it   hence the circular file       when it did work  it worked just okay  i didn t like the speeds on the fan or the heat settings  high is too high  low is too low  none of them felt quite right  save yourself some money and buy the remington d2012 that they sell here at amazon  our new one just arrived  it s got a quieter motor  absolute perfect fan speeds and heat settings  and a true 4 year warranty  best part  you can buy almost three of them for the price i paid for the bespoke     if you are looking for a top of the line hair dryer then keep looking  the bespoke has no warranty here and the product really isn t that well thought out in the first place  look at one of the other offerings and make sure you get a true warranty  used this hair dryer at a hotel and loved it    had to order    great price    great travel hair dryer folds nice  after only using it once i noticed the bristles on the brush attachment have already started to flatten   i am returning it because i can only imagine what it s going to look like after daily use for only a month   i noticed another reviewer wrote s he is looking for replacement attachments   i d rather just buy a better quality product to start with   also  the power of this hairdryer doesn t even match my cheaper conair dryer that i bought at the drugstore and was hoping to replace with this more expensive and supposedly better quality hairdryer  this model replaces an earlier one that put out a lot of heat  but the replacement  one  while seemingly appearing to have been upgraded  does not put out the level of heat as the one i replaced after several years of use  that one died  also  the digital clock is not included in the replacement model  that was a feature much appreciated so without it i feel a bit more of disapointment  however  the replacement model does look smart mounted on the bathroom wall  this is a great hair dryer   unlike most non commercial hair dryers  it gets hot enough to quickly dry my hair   it s weight is typical for dryers this size   the buttons on the handle are easily avoided once you use the dryer a couple of times   i also like the color   i would buy this brand again  i purchased the conair wallmount dryer because we absolutely wore out our last one and we loved that one so much that we bought another   i have these hairdryers in both of our bathrooms and they are so handy because they are right there   just pick it up and turn it on and you are ready to go   great product  i purchased one to try  then two more  the first on failed at at arrival and since i call 32 days after i ordered  not received  it has been used twice  they declined to honor this purchase  i have called five times to only be told there is no supervisor to make a decision  them they tell me they declined it  but will never call or email back  the product is defective  the handle is burning up and burnt my daughter s hand     dissipointed    this hair dryer is wonderful   drys my hair much more quickly than the conair dryer i purchased at target   very sturdy   would recommend it as a great investment in hair care  i asked my hairdresser if dryers made a difference and she went on and on about the one she used  which is this one  she said she even takes it home evenings and weekends to use on her own hair  bad news  it cost about  350  i wrote down the model and thought i would just see what i could find  i couldn t believe it when i found it on here for under  100  i got it within three days of placing my order and tried it right away  it was truly amazing the difference it made with my hair  i have thinner hair with a natural wave so when it dries it dries more curly and frizzy so i usually use a round brush with a dryer to straighten and smooth it  with this dryer  it was shinier and smoother in half the time  i have been able to come close to how it looks when it is professionally blown out  for all those who don t think a dryer makes a difference   i m telling you this one did for me  couldn t be happier with the purchase  this blow dryer was in a hotel room i was staying at  i fell in love with it it dried my hair so fast it is very powerful i love it           i bought this for my daughters  to use in their bathroom  it is out of the way and no cords on the counter  the green night light is bright  but the girls like it since it brightens the bathroom up at night  they can remove replace the dryer by themselves  they are 5 and 10 years old   they don t have to squeeze anything to remove it   just gently pull  it is quiet with high low speeds  i did not use the anchors screws that came with the kit  since i had young girls who would be pulling the dryer off of the wall and may not be so gentle  i replaced those with drywall toggle bolts  it is nice that the gfi is built into the unit and not on the plug so that the plug does not block an outlet or have to plug into the bottom outlet only  i recommend this product  only reason for 4 stars is because of the hardware they sent with it  there is no way i can see those screws and anchors staying in the wall with people pulling on the dryer to remove it  i used this hair dryer while on vacation and loved it  i like everything about it except  i d like a longer cord  i especially like the way the cord retracts so you don t have it lying around on the counter  i would definitely recommend it  this product was recommended to me by a friend who always has good hair  i bought it and i am dissappointed with as its so slow  i thought since i was paying so much it would be quicker   better  i don t personally like it that much  you need to have a lot of time and patience   and for that you can probably get good hair with any priced dryer  i first purchased the wall mount hair dryer for our 5th wheel  and since i have installed them in two bathrooms in our home     the wife loves them  for the last couple of months i have researched and read reviews of every hair dryer imaginable on every website imaginable and finally settled on this hair dryer   and i couldn t be happier     my hair is     1   straight  2   smooth  3   not frizzy  4   shiny  5   volumous  6   looks like i just got a blow out at a salon    let me start at the beginning   my hair is shoulder length  somewhere between curly and wavy  tends to be dry and frizzes very easily   i am typically a slave to the flat iron  but no more   here is what i did  step by step to achieve my best hair day ever  that i have done myself  no salon styling included      1   i washed and conditioned my hair  as usual  2   after towel drying my hair  i used a wide tooth comb to smooth it out and put a dollop of leave in conditioner on the ends   i then let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes while i putzed around the house   3   i sectioned my hair and clipped up any hair i was not blow drying at the time     4   on each section i was drying i put a tiny dot of straightening cream and worked it through my hair   5   using a 1 25 round natural bristle brush  i blew each section dry with a downward motion of the brush and dryer   as i was done with each section  i clipped it away and worked with one section at a time   it got a little awkward in the back  but i figured i would touch up with the flat iron at the end   6   there was no need for touching up   my hair came out great   i used a dollop of shine wax when i was done drying and shaped my hair   i finished with a spritz of hair spray       even if this hair dryer broke after one use  i would shell out the cash to get another one   it is that worth it   i did not have any problems with the buttons that some people said and i did not think it was too heavy to work with either   what can i say   i love this hair dryer and i would give it 10 stars  i prefer woven floss  but could not find on shelves anywhere   so glad to be weaving again instead of waxing  the vacuum works nice   catches the cut hair and it is easy to empty the collection space  cuts hair as advertised  and has the usual snap on attachments  lasted a year  then quit with no warning   22   shipping  i ve been using the loving naturals sunscreen lotion for my 15 month old and decided to try out the stick  initial reaction  love it  i love loving naturals  products because they are made of safe organic ingredients which is exactly what i want for my baby s sensitive skin  it contains almost 25  zinc oxide which is what our doctor recommended to look for as the active ingredient as this is the best protection from the sun   we love the lotion  but the stick is great for keeping in your purse diaper bag  i carry it with me everywhere just in case we do an inpromptu play session outside and i love that it s a stick so i don t have to get it all over my hands  i used this on my husband s back  and while yes  it hurt  hello  you re pulling the hair from the roots  of course it hurts   it did a great job at getting all of the hair   it didn t leave much of anything behind and i never had to redo any spots   i did my husband s entire back and went through an entire thing of wax  although we had tons of strips leftover   just so you can judge how much you might need   oh  and it smells good  too  all three shades work beautifully  however if you are fairer complected  stick with bare your soul and look on the bright side  this one is a bit corally with a ever so slight shimmer  its all sheer and will work but would just look better on asian african american latin skin tones  you can t go wrong so don t sweat the exact shade  i have been using this for a year  love it    i leave the 1st application on my hair for 40 min to cover gray completely  this will make your hair more reddish than the color of your choice so be careful  i use color black  so the finish is warm brown  my natural hair color is dark brown    you will need disposable gloves and cap  and some plastic sheet to cover your floor  thank you for the great product  and the wonderful samples for tanning   i now know where to go to purchase products such as this     nice touch this mirror is awesome for plucking stray hairs and seeing what s going on up close on your face  this is the next best thing to a massaging chair  i found the cushion works best when used in a recliner  my husband loves this product  although i accidentally way overpaid for this which upsets me  the product is great and lasts a long time   he has used it many times before and it smells good  too   next time just get it directly from burts bees retailer website where you can easily get it for cost   you don t have to get it from amazon s private dealers  which can way overcharge for things  so  i thought that the cheap and average brush i had worked well  until i got this brush  i applied my bronzer blush with it and i looked practically flawless  i was shocked at how bad i have been looking compared to the coverage and effect this brush does  i would say it is almost worth the price  but luckily i got mine for far cheaper on a different site   this is a really great brush and i will seriously cry if anything happens to it hahaha i have tried every conditioner known to women   when i wash my hair  after i finish rinsing the shampoo out  my hair feels coarse and tangled   i have used everything from oil treatments to leave in conditioners   nothing has worked in detangling my hair while i m in the shower   until i tried a sample of the senscience  conditioner   it was amazing   my hair instantly detangled in the shower   and i mean instantly   so i immediately went online to find this incredible product   i ordered the biggest bottle i could find  my hair is shiny  full and feels incredible   i love this conditioner and i am so grateful i finally found it  i have achieved healthy looking non frizzy hair by rubbing this oil over my hands and cuticles  and then running my hands through my hair  a little of this stuff goes a long way  i also love that this product has no fragrance  it is practically odorless  which makes it ok to use around my chemically sensitive mother  its a great product  would buy it again  i was really excited about this product as i am a firm believer in the benefits of tea tree oil  the scent was mild and to my liking  however the effects wore off in a few hours  a much shorter time than my fragrance free crystal deoderant which contains only natural mineral salts  while at work i could actually smell myself to the point of embarrassment as i felt sure that others were also smelling me  this from some one with a naturally mild body odor and body chemistry  i tried  it  at least 3 times   hoping that i was mistaken but the same thing happened every time  since it came in a packet of 4  i gave them to my husband  it seems to be working a bit better for him  but the effects are still for a fairly short duration  if you have a shower every 4 5 hours or so though  this product may be the perfect one to get  i am verry happy with body time spray on natural body moisturizer     i was a faithful user of nivea spray on moisturizer for several years  unfortunately  nivea discontinued this product     after an internet search  i located body time spray on natural body moisturizer  and immediately ordered two bottles      in my opinion body time is better than nivea  i will continue to purchase this product  and i have recommended it to my girlfriends     renate wagner i have fine black hair and i love this product   i spritz it on before blow drying   i can definitely tell the difference when i don t use it   it adds body and it feels light   to keep the volume i use elnett hairspray to finish the look  i ve been using this shade for almost 18 months  almost every day   i use a little for office wear and more for more dramatic night smoky eye  it goes on perfectly  and has just enough shimmer  it s my all time favorite eyeshadow  i have very sensitive eyes and this is the perfect product for me  i ve had it for about a year   a half and recently purchased another mascara to replace it  i didn t realize how good i had it  this mascara has a thin brush that makes it easy to apply with precision  goes on without clumps  has a very natural look and best of all  i don t need makeup remover to get it off   i didn t even own any until i tried out my new stuff and had massive raccoon eyes   sure  the little lash tubes can look creepy coming off  may stick to your cheeks or the sink a little  but it s worth it to not have to rub my eyes with make up remover and have puffy red eyes after  it s the only kind i ll buy again  i have oily skin on to of dry skin  therefore  makes it very hard to find a good skincare line  i get so tired of trying out skincare products made for combination skin  normal oily   face creams for dry skin is just too much moisture and oil for my type of skin  finding good all natural skincare is even harder  i use pangea organics line for the day time  i use this oil for night because i wake up with very oily and very dry skin  using this actually helps reduce this and makes my skin feel so much softer  it s hard for me blend this oil on my face alone without using more than 2 drops  so  i mix this in with my pangea organics face lotion at night and wake up with refreshed looking skin  i haven t tried using this oil in the day time since i get the midday oil slick  but i hear argan oil reduces the oiliness without drying the skin  here s another bonus  my skin tend to get flushed in the afternoon  like as if i just ran a marathon  using this argan oil reduced the redness      one of the reviewer says it might not be pure because it is fragrance free  instead will try one that has the fragrance  i don t doubt this is product is of lesser quality because the information supplied by slice of nature says that there are 3 processing types for argan oil  one of them is make argan oil fragrance free and most of the time comes out clear  the other type of processing keeps the fragrance and the color is yellow or darker and it is mostly used for cooking  maybe for cosmetics  i personally don t want to put cooking oil on my skin  since cooking oil can go rancid very quickly  that s like saying that i will put grapeseed cooking oil for my body  would you do this  this one from watt s beauty is clear and it is contained in a very simple and plain brown bottle with a dropper  which is very useful      as always with any consumer products  it s always either you like it or you don t  i personally like this and will continue to use it     i haven t tried using this on my hair or on my body  my hair is pretty normal  i do intend on using this with my body lotion very soon  i m a guy who s pretty much fine with head and shoulders as a shampoo of choice so i m not particularly discriminating  i have fairly thick hair that i keep mine cut short so if pro v was going to give my hair volume i would hardly notice  overall i was pleased with the shampoo and it literally left my hair squeaky clean  i m not sure if that s necessarily a good thing since according to my wife that squeak is caused when shampoo strips the oil from your hair  i needed to continue to use my head and shoulders occasionally because the pro v doesn t seem to help with dandruff  the pro v was fine but i didn t notice a huge difference with other shampoos  i was excited the first time i used this razor because it shaves so close  br   by the end of the day my throat and neck area was extremely irritated and i had hundreds of ingrown hairs  br   thanks for the extremely close shave  br   i was so embarrassed when i went to my girlfriend s house that night  br   i like my face to be clean and smooth but this is just too close of a shave  br   also i must note that the blade gets worn down very easily and gets clogged with shaving cream hair  have only used once but have high expectations   smell was not really so great but not horrible   the after tan smell  that burnt hair smell  was not bad at all   so well worth it there   i could still smell it but it wasnt overpowering like most lotions are   gave me good color right out of the bed but not the best  br    br   i still think worship me does a much better job giving you color right out of the bed   i looked like a goddess of the islands after using that just once   also worship me smells better   but meh  i ll try this and see  br    br   hope it works    the only reason i didn t give it 5 stars is because i agree with some of the other reviews  it should be longer   i wish about 4 inches longer  and it d be perfect   however  its not a huge issue  when i use it in the shower i can scrub my back from above my shoulder  and then from below to get my lower back  br    br   also  you can t tell from the pictures  but the brush needles are held in place by glue  not staples as i think someone else had written   no rust should occur on this since it s all plastic  i add the conditioner to my routine  my  husband found that it really helped when he use both the shampoo and the conditioner and left the conditioner on for a couple of minutes i use this product along with conditioner and blowout serum  i got the brazilian blowout treatment in my hair and it s just phenomenal how i don t have to worry about my hair anymore  i do recommend the treatment before purchasing the shampoo  conditioner  and serum  after all  the only reason to purchase these outrageously expensive products is to maintain the treatment longer  i m very happy with the treatment   300  600  depending on length   but i am not very happy with the products  they do leave a lot of dandruff  but if you paid for the brazilian blowout treatment   might as well maintain it by using the correct products  i will only continue to purchase this product as long as i keep getting the brazilian blowout treatments  if you love vanilla  you will love this essential oil  i m glad i bought this i had purchases matte polish previously so i know that it doesnt last as long  but its better than what other reviews are saying  i love the color and the matte finish is great  i have been wearing it for 4 days and no chips so far  you just have to put one thin coat on and it wont come of in huge flakes  these flower shaped toe separators are super cute and they work fine to separate your toes to polish but when you take them off  the flowers easily rip off making them good for one use   i ll have to sacrifice esthetics and go with the plain old separators next time  at first i was kind of scared to get one of these for cheap  bc i m scared to get cut  but fortunately this price is great  and it works fantastic  i love it    and it comes with 10 replacement blades  it s a great deal  this is the best lip balm i ve ever used   i m a lip balm gloss fanatic and i just love this stuff   it stays on for hours and leaves my lips feeling moisturized and the chapping goes away instantly  if you never use lip balm   all try this and you ll be hooked  i know i am  very happy with the seller  the product is awesome too  the seller had this to me from ca before i got the shipment notification   very please will shop again  the item i received was perfect for what i needed it for  i am making a costume for my sister  fairly sturdy and comes with ribbon around it  a cute touch  very cute and perfect for a costume  not so sure about a formal event since it is felt but i was very happy about my order  ordered from 911costume  very fast shipping  after several failed attempts trying to buy a remington shortcut that would hold a charge  i stumbled onto the philips norelco qc5170  it is by far the best hair clipper i have ever owned    first things first   this baby holds a charge  it has over an hour of run time on a full charge  and if the charge does run out  it works with its ac charger plugged in  so you re never stuck with half a haircut and a dead set of clippers    the cutter is powerful  the blades move fast so they don t pull your hair  they cut it   its adjustable cut settings and its pivoting spacer comb combine to produce a great  easy haircut  i also use it to trim my beard  the primary spacer comb easily pops off for easy cleaning  or to attach one of the specialty combs and cutters that also come with it   i enthusiastically recommend this product  my last penlet died pretty quickly  this one seems a lot more solid and has been working great  i hope it lasts a long time  i don t want to have to be buying a new one every few months  i found this product by accident while trying to find a certain brand of make up on amazon   because of the price   reviews i decided to purchase it for my 17 year old daughter  who is really into pretty eye shadows   i have spent a fortune on colorful name brand eyeshadows at the store     i have to say  my daughter loves this eye shadow  i just purchased 2 more of these eye shadow palettes  one for me   another for her    will continue to buy them  the palette came wrapped tight in bubble wrap   all 88 shades were in perfect condition  i also love the way they are packaged  slim enough to throw in your purse but large enough when you open it that you can easily use the inside mirror to put on the eye shadow  and talk about color options  wow  they are very vibrant  beautiful colors  it would also make a great affordable gift for anyone you know who loves to have fun with eye shadow  this facial sunblock is easy to rub in  non greasy or oily  which is great for me because i sometimes break out   and doesn t irritate   in the summer  i use this as a moisturizer after washing my face in the morning and then reapply if i m in the sun for extended periods       it was rated highly on the environmental working group  ewg  website as it contains no carcinogens and minimal toxins  it s impossibly for a sunblock to be completely free of toxins and actually work    it s a broad spectrum sunblock as well which means that it protects well against a large range of uvb and uva wavelengths of light     highly recommended    simply put  youngest daughter wouldn t stop  tried everything  2 days     it s tastes horrid  and doesn t go away equals strong incentive not to put your thumb in there  i love the korres fig items  they truly smell like you just got a whiff of a fresh fig  the body butter is paraben free and really saves dry skin  i got a lot of sun this summer and this takes the dry skin right away  i love it  it s a great item  it dries super quick  i never have to waste time waiting for nail polish to dry again  yay    after reading many reviews  i decided to get this one   i ve been using a variety of different ones and most work pretty well   this one continues that trend   it cuts well and is easy to maintain   the only downsides is that it might get a little warmer louder than what i remember of the others i ve used and without a guard  it doesn t get quite as close as some of the other clippers   i d recommend it for anyone who isn t looking for a really close cut  we ve only used this a few times but we have not gotten sunburn at all and i can feel pretty good about the ingredients  especially for kids  i love it  bought it with book on makeup and i use it to create beautiful styles  it has blush  liners and eyebrow quality colors  then lots of eyeshadows   i really love it and enjoy every color  i ordered this on 8 2 recieved it priority mail on 8 5     that is great customer service  i ordered all three kinds of units because i wanted it to be convient for my son with new braces  to use   i installed redibreeze and the quick breeze in two different bathrooms   both were easy to install    worked great the first time   have not installed the shower unit yet  but expect it to be just as easy   this is a great product    works really well to clean my between my teeth and the holes left by wisdom teeth removal   easy for my son to use with his braces     i have not used a waterpik but cannot imagine how it would work better   my only idea for the company might be to make a model that you can insert salt tablets or other kind of dissolving disinfectant into so you can get a salt water spray    along the same ideas they use for car washing        thanks for a great product    and thanks for fast delivery looks great and presented excellent     but  this item must be turned off completely after each use near where  the unit was installed at the rear of the toliet near the floor     you and or your guests have to remember this  stated in the directions    in asia where these are very popular you do not have to turn the unit off after each use   mine leaks a little either in the open postion or closed postion while hanging on the wall      i would say to look for a better unit before buying this one  i was very dissappointed in the quality  i was so glad to find my color online  because they no longer stock it in my area  br   thanks  the items was in great condition when it arrived  cost a bit more than in the store  was about  8 each here   i have this lipstick in rose brown and i love it   such a subtle and pretty color  i wish the staying power of this product was a bit better  but other than that  i can t complain  green is my favorite color and i love them as nail polishes  who the shrek are you is a very unique color that you won t find anywhere else  br   the application was ok but not great  i thought the polish was a little thin and i had to use 3 coats  br   however  i first fell in love with this color when i got it for a manicure  picture included  and i only had 2 coats on  br   you will not regret having this color in your closet  it is perfect for summer  i originally purchased this product for sunburn relief and loved it   it is the one product that not only helped ease the pain and discomfort of sunburn  but you don t have to rub the product into sensitive sunburnt skin   it absorbs into your skin in seconds   what a relief   i also found other uses for it   in the winter  when dry skin is more prominent  just spray it on and it has the same relieving effect   now  i don t even buy hair conditioner   it even works as that   so for around  9 00 a bottle  you really have 3 products in one   what a bargain  i am using all the obagi line and is an excellent product  you can see the results within a week from using it  i ordered as a standard shipping and i got the product in 2 days  excellent service by the way   asin b001cjj5wc obagi nu derm  4 am exfoderm forte exfoliation enhancer  2 ounce bottle   i have used home blonding hair color for over 30 years  having used every imaginable product on the market   dream blondes is by far the best and is the only product i use   it contains a pre color conditioner  enough color for long hair  no more having to purchase two boxes of other coloring   and consistently provides beautiful color with excellent conditioning   the amazon price is 1 3 of the discount or drug store price  i purchased a case when i saw the price and am going to order another      what a great bargain for the best product    thank you amaon   i was extremely happy with the promptness of my order and delivery   which was free  i am still waiting on my order i placed 3 weeks ago for the same product through beautydepot  haire supplies is a very professional business who will continue to have my business from now  amazon is just great with whatever you order  they know who to do business with  i purchased this watch for a legally blind  elderly friend of mine  the watch is just like the one radio shack use to sell  this watch is far superior to the new watch radio shack is selling  it can be heard loud and clear  and it is easy to use  i would recommend it for any one with vision problems  i am a female and i bought this shaver for my bikini and genital area   i personally think it does a better job on the genital area than on the bikini area   it really makes a difference at what angles your hair grows  and if your hair is on the smoother side and grows very parallel to your skin  like it does on the areas that would show right around my bikini line   it s tough to get it all with this shaver   it does a good job on the more coarse hair in more intimate areas  as those stand at more of a perpendicular angle  especially when they re short and stubbly after having been shaved a few days before      you will have to pull gently at your skin and or hold it in a kind of pinched way sometimes to make sure you get all of the hairs at an angle the shaver will reach  but none of that is painful and it does work   you ll also have to go over each area more than once  so plan on devoting a few minutes to the process  more than that for your first time or two   because you won t be able to get it all super quickly with the multiple runs over areas and the need to stretch and pull your skin   i haven t really had any experiences of it pinching or nicking my skin   do use some sort of baby powder  particularly in damper areas to make the skin dry and easy to run the shaver over     i use a compressed air can  along with the little cleaning brush that comes with it  to clean it after each use   i don t think the brush does a thorough job on its own     overall i m quite happy with this product and would recommend it as a worthwhile purchase   i have to use it pretty much every day to stay truly smooth  and there are a couple tiny areas that i tend to run a razor over  going in the same direction as the hair so it won t create razor burn  after using the shaver just because the hair in those places isn t at enough of an angle for the shaver to really reach   you would definitely need to use a trimmer to get the hair to a short stubble before using this shaver  i opted for actually shaving everything with a razor first  and then using the shaver to shave the stubble once it started growing back a day or two later  and have continued doing that stubble maintenance ever since     the battery life is also pretty good   i ve had the razor for about six months now and have changed the batteries only once so far  probably a couple of months in  while using it every few days  this is a great product   although a bit pricey a little goes a long way and i love the way it helps your hair dry faster   not sure how it works  but it does   although the product says it is oil my hair is never greasy feeling and feels great  i would certainly recommend it for longer hair  i tried these for about three days and found them difficult to tolerate  the bottom strip is especially challenging to get on right  and they make me salivate for the 30 minutes i have them in  and leave goop behind  i have to really motivate myself to use them  and have several times wondered if my teeth aren t already white enough  my dentist recommended them  so they probably do work if you can stick with the regimen  i haven t been able to so far  my hairdresser recommended this oil while i was at the shop one day   she stated it was the only product from which she got results after chemo   it makes my hair soft and manageable   i don t have frizzies and it does not weigh my hair down   not only is it great for my hair but its good for my skin   the fragerance is clean and fresh  i have used several kinds of crest whitestrips  from the original to the pro to the advanced and other varieties   i love them  even the original strips work great   these 5 minute strips  however  i was not impressed with and found them to be pretty much ineffective   my advice to those with sensitive teeth   rather than buying these strips  buy the originals or an upgraded version and use them less often than as directed to reduce sensitivity   use them once every few days or once a week rather than the recommended once or twice a day   you will still get great results  but giving your teeth a break in between uses will dramatically decrease any pain from sensitivity  when i had moved in with my gf  she had brought along one of those cheap oral b vitality electric toothbrushes  she had purchased a three pack of the floss action heads  so i decided to use it to keep up with my teeth hygiene  well my background is using the sensitive function on a more expensive oral b electric toothbrush  well let me just say that that experience was well learned and a lesson that i learned that i needed a sensitive tooth brush head  the oral b only has an on and off function  so there is no calming down the motor in it  the floss action was just to hard on my teeth  i am a young guy  but i am just so blessed with sensitive teeth  so i decided to purchase this through amazon since this was the best price around  when i got it i went home after work and tried it out  wow what a difference between this and the floss action  as well as just a manual toothbrush  i didnt get any pains at all from using it  and now several weeks in and still no side effects from using it  i can now truly appreciate the cleaning power of the toothbrush itself  i would totally recommend this to anyone who cannot afford one of the high end electric toothbrushes with a sensitive mode  this product has delivered higher results than i expected  this was my third purchase  i take the recommended six tablets per day  i m in my fourth month of using this supplement and i plan to continue with it  indefinitely  initially  there was a substantial weight loss   a little too much for me   but i ve since regained what i needed  my fine hair seems no thicker   but   where there was a noticeable receding hairline  all the hair has regrown and that sure is wonderful  complexion and fingernails show nice improvements  but the most remarkable for me is that i no longer need to wear supports for my ankles when i m active  i suffered a degree of permanent damage to the tendons in both ankles many years ago  to the point that i had to be careful just getting out of bed in the morning  now  i am pain free and enjoy wearing the shoes of my choice   overall  i credit this product with substantial improvement to the quality of my life and i would highly recommend giving it a try  i haven t seen any of the great skin improvements that are supposed to come with a clarisonic  but i do feel as though my face is very  very clean when i m done using it  and that s a good enough reason to have it in my book  this color is awesome  you won t find any like it  it s a very sweet almost turquoise green  i have had a lot of compliments on it  br   the application was a bit streaky so i had to use 3 coats  but the finish was real good  br   add a glossy top coat to it and it looks like a jelly bean on your hand  this is very nice product  quality is quite good  and save you from risk of missing pills    very handy and portable i received this product and enjoyed using this   i was expecting a quicker result   it wasn t a miracle worker for me   beth i can t believe how easy this is   i just finished my first haircut   took me maybe 10 minutes tops   did it entirely by myself  and i can t say there is any real difference between what i feel and see in the mirror from when the barber did it   and no one else has noticed any difference or mentioned it  i always told my barber anyway not to shave over the ears and around the back   just at the bottom of my sideburns     i am delighted i made this purchase   i would not recommend this to anyone who has hair much longer than a crewcut  however  i was actually wearing this color when i had my daughter  who is now 2   so i have an emotional connection   honestly though  it is a great color   if you are familiar with opi you know it is a quality product   the color is very girly without reminding you of little girls   it has the maturity behind it i guess you would say   i love love love it and i was so glad to find it as it is discontinued  i bought this product because i have the hair serum  which i liked also  and smells nice   i tried the shampoo today and being that today is an extremely humid day  the product held up nicely   my hair had no tangles and smells so pretty   i will purchase this again   when i began shampooing i felt my hair was not feeling dry and all tangled like some others i ve tried  and i ve tried all the well known ones   it felt soft and shiny   kind of silky  r5130     what a cheap piece of junk  you cannot take the heads apart to clean      i guess they figure everybody will toe the line and just buy new blades  with norelco i could easily pop the blades out to clean it     going back to norelco                    this is okay but i m not fond of the smell   there is another bhringraj hair oil on amazon that smells way better and leaves your hair soooo soft  the purpose of a sonic toothbrush to augment the normal cleaning abilities of bristles by moving them rapidly and also to generate a secondary  cavitation effect  removing biofilms beyond the reach of the actual bristles  these sonic seals defeat these mechanics of flexcare toothbrushes by filling the gap that allows the brush head to clear the handle  dampening the oscillations intended to be transmitted to the brush head and sending some of them back into the handle  the flexcare line is too easy to clean to necessitate a product like this  i felt compelled to write this review because my wife nagged me   she says its a really good bra strap concealer     i took 1 star off beacuse of the high price  in my mind  these should go for like  4 99    comes in pack of 6  i took one for use with my pc s cable management  great scent that isn t too sweet but not too woodsy either  some are turned off by the fact that it s made by the famous womens bridal designer  but in reality  she knows how to make a man smell amazing  i love this scent and have been wearing it for three years  first time to buy it from amazon and the process was a breeze with fast shipping  this is my second time buying ivory caps   i went wiith the 3 bottles deal this time  i had taken it for about 2 months and had noticed a great difference not only in the reduction of dark spots and uneven skin tone but also in the smoothness and texture of my skin   i appears smoother and softer especially on my face   my skin appears healthier and a small scar above my eye appears lighter and less noticable   i take 2 3 capsules daily with a glass of orange juice for the vitamin c content   i find this works best  people  this is the real deal  i would absolutely recommend this product  this is a marvelous shave   nothing else that i have ever used is anywhere near as comfortable  use it with a gel lather and you will never ever again feel the discomfort of razor burn no matter how hard you work  or workout  and prespire   ever    i love love love this color  br   when i put it on it s like christmas on my fingers  it s a dark red with red very thin glitter  a perfect match to dorothy s shoes  br   application was great  you only need two coats  i was nicely surprised by the wear and tear  after 5 days i hardly had any tear  br   it really is a fabulous color than you can wear on your hands or toes  summer or winter and that i think is safe for work  it s sophisticated with a little surprise  br   i highly recommend  delivery is fast  i received the item in excellent brand new condition  this flat iron does what it says and even more  it cuts half the time of straigthening my daughters hair  leaves it very shiny and natural looking without the hassle  it heats up very fast and the temperature is adjustable to fit anyone s type of hair  i love it    i discovered this wonderful mint leaf soap at the home of a friend  and was very happy to find it available at amazon  great value and i will buy it again  the dryer works well  the attachments stay on very secure and the dryer is very light weight  the only issue is that the dryer setting button easily slides into other setting while holding it  i bought this for my mom who had been looking for shalimar bar soap for ever   glad i found it online   it is so scrumptious smelling  this item was no longer available in stores  so i ordered enough to last a year from amazon seller abc wholesale because i liked the product so much  they packaged the items in sets of three in plastic shrinkwrap   they substituted a different style  volume blast   which is in the exact same can except for the name   i did not notice the substitution until i opened the last 2 shrink wraps   all six were the substituted item  not the max volume item that i had ordered   now i m stuck with 6 cans of hair spray that are a very different item and performance from what i had originally ordered  i ve been using this hand cream for years and i ve tried others  but this is still my favorite   the bottle is a convenient size  i keep one in my desk at work  one in my purse  etc   the lotion itself does wonders on my hands and is not greasy at all  rather  it s thick and absorbs relatively quickly   additionally  i m sensitive to products with added scents  so i love that it really is fragrance free  finally  a nail file that does the job the first time   i had tried cheaper glass nail files  revlon  and the abrasive surface wore off and it no longer worked   the opi file works great and has lasted   i just reordered more as gifts   try it  i purchased this product hoping for something that would eliminate my hair problem or at least help keep it under control  this product does exactly what it says it will do and works well  very durable  you don t have to worry about breaking because it is indeed a spring  but wow  does it ever hurt  i just can not put myself through that pain on a daily basis and if you don t do it just correctly it increases the pain by 1000 times  this method of hair removal is much worse than waxing  if i had thicker  tougher skin that wasn t so sensitive i would love this product but it is just too much pain for me to handle  my mother is allergic to both amonia and peroxide  she has been using this product for more than 6 months without any allergic reactions the color stays in longer than some of the similar products she previously used  we have had problems finding this product in stores so purchasing online is an excellent option and saves a whole bunch of time in trying to find it   the package was received before the estimated time stated on amazon which i also think is excellent  this toap coat saves my life  every time i feel disappointed by a nail polish  i put one coat of orly glosser and it s like a new polish  it gives a very clean and bright finish to all kind of shades and textures  it makes the nail very shiny and smooth  br   i protects from the wear and tear as well  but i think there is better out there if this is the only reason you re wanting a top coat  however if you want a top coat that brings the best of your polish  this is it  this has been a favorite perfume of mine for a long time   many years   spicy floral aroma  not too strong   the problem is that oscar de la renta no longer makes this scent  so essentially we re buying what was manufactured    years ago   eventually there will be no more   and eventually i suspect the remaining bottles will not be as full scented as they once were   that also means you can t get the lotion or dusting powder anymore  br    br   so get it while you can    or not  because i m still using it and don t want to run out  make sure you have a lot of time before you apply  be sure to exfoliate  apply lotion to dry areas  and wear gloves  only apply a small amount at a time  so you don t end up with streaks  if you take your time   do it right  you will love the natural tan results  easy to use  transport and fast  great buy    a must now for my bathroom  i have beenn using the samsara cologne and body cream for years   amazon had it at a really great price and i was glad i could find it here   i love this fragrance in the winter months and the fall   it s not heavy at all   it had a woodsy fragrance and reminds me of winter   i love it  i like this product for everyday use  it wears well and does show results  i wasnt blown away by the volume  and i would have liked this in waterproof  but al in all  for the price it was great  a mite spicy  a little woodsy  a bit floral  a touch exotic  a hint of warm     basically perfect     seems like every time i leave the house with this scent on  someone moves in closer  inhales and then asks me what i m wearing     and i m middle aged and chubby  so it s not a move    it s just the scent     can be over powering if over done  but with a light hand this one is just right  good product   strange delivery in that it is shipped in more than one box  this pill box does not hold 50 pills   given that vitamins and supplements are of various sizes  this container will not hold more than 10 total  this conditioner did soooo not live to my expectations  fist of all it is not tick enough  it falls flat like pancake batter on your hand  second you need a ton before you can start distributing it effectively on your hair  third i ve already used it three times and i really don t see any reduction in brassiness  i really don t understand why this conditioner is so expensive and most of all i don t understand how some people can give it good reviews  i got a bottle of this as i was desparate to find something that could keep my nose from burning when i am out on the water for long periods boating jetskiing  i just used this product for 9 days straight with several hours  up to 10 hrs  each day in direct sun  my nose did not burn  unfortunately  it is not legal to sell in the united states  i hope to find a means to buy it on line  the only issue i have with this product it that if used on legs or parts that come in contact with the jetski seat  it will cause the vinyl seat to fade in color at the point of contact   so now i just use it for my face or parts that are very susceptible to burning  great stuff  i am very picky when it comes to my blow dryers  i can t commit  my sister had purchased this item at target and i loved it  it has great power for it not being a professional hair dryer  i searched for it at 3 targets and found out they no longer carried it  i was browsing on amazon and found it  i ordered it immediately  i am very happy i purchased this item  it didn t do much for my hair   it just feels cool on the scalp if you have braids   i wouldn t purchase it again  this is the best makeup i have ever used   it gives a lovely matte finish  and you don t need to use a lot   doesn t promote breakouts  and is also a sunscreen   it s great  i must say  i was at the beginning skeptical of trying this soap  i went to the beauty supply and right before my eyes  i saw dudu osun     i decided to try it out because of the great reviews  i spent  4 99 1 bar   and can say honestly that every penny was worth wild  this makes my skin feel soooo refreshed soft and clean  dudu osun has an earthy smell  and is pleasant to my sences       my skin is brighter  cleaner  and my dark spots has lightened after 2 uses  i will most definitely purchase more of this soap and will use it as a bath soap as well  just wanted to add that i also purchased  100  pure shea butter ghana   and i love this as a moisturizer after using dudu osun  and these two are a great combination together  my skin looks flawless       i got this in the mail today i was so happy when i opened it the colors are beautiful and bright    i was a little sad that one of the eye shadows was broken and it was messy when i opened it     other than that i love it  and it goes on great and does not look chalky or cheap at all     great buy     this floss is the kind recommended by my dentist and i can t find it in stores anywhere   target used to have it but not recently   decently priced online  and good service on delivery  great shaver but all the shavings fall out and little stays in the shaving head area  if you want to see these lipcolors in action  i suggest watching the first movie in the twilight saga  bella swan wore the color good to go  and the entire cullen family  males and females  wore the shade ms  behavin   though i love these lipsticks  they are not for everyone  the colors are buildable  you can easily add more to any look   but they go on very sheer  they are meant more for enhancing natural lip color than for actually changing their color  and touch ups are necessary after just an hour or two  if you choose to purchase this product  i recommend buying a lip stick primer that will prolong the color for awhile  as i said  they are very sheer  so if you are looking more for a rich lipstick shade than just a tinted gloss  i suggested not throwing away your  18  you will be very unhappy  however  i love glosses rather than sticks  and these colors have done wonders for my extremely pale lips  i have white blonde eyelashes and eyebrows  i never leave home without mascara  yeah  okay  and a little lipgloss  too  i m vain   i found so much freedom in using this product   i can now go to the water park  the pool  the beach  etc and actually have noticeable eyes without having to bother with waterproof mascara  that destroys your lashes anyway      it was easy   fast to use    start to finish  including clean up  it took maybe 10 minutes  if it s messy for you  you re using too much of the gel at one time  the trick is to make sure you use the 1st chemical several times and allow it to soak through the hair s cuticle  once that s done  it s just a matter of barely touching your lashes with the colorant gel and presto  dark lashes       ladies  it only colors your existing lashes  it doesn t make them longer or thicker   if you take your time and apply it carefully  you can get it to go from the base to the tips of your lashes   i colored my lashes about 3 weeks ago  and it s still going strong   i ll probably do a touch up in another week or so  i m very happy with this product  i wish i d found it 20 years ago   i can t imagine not having this in my beauty arsenal  now that i ve discovered it  i ll never be without it again  i purchased this peel because i wanted something that might help to fade any small freckles sun spots developing on my face  as well as fade small wrinkles near my eyes  i am asian  with a medium light complexion that is already fairly wrinkle and acne free  but i was starting to see more melanin spots on my face developing  as i didn t start using sunscreen on my face daily until age 30  i am now 35   however  my skin does tend to be oily in the t zone  and i would still get an occasional pimple on my forehead or under my cheekbones on a regular basis      after using this product  i noticed that my already scarce breakouts became practically non existent  and though some of the small freckles on my upper cheeks haven t faded much  my skin does feel and look smoother and clearer  i don t use concealer  powder  or foundation  i can t stand the look and feel of it on my skin   and only use shiseido spf 55 for the face on a daily basis  but this seems to be all i need to still look pretty flawless  which i attribute to some of the peel s effects  i originally only used the 35  glycolic acid peel sold by the same company  but decided to try this lactic acid glycolic acid combination to see if it would have a different or stronger effect  it does sting tingle more than the 35  glycolic acid peel alone   i usually use this product every 7 days  and leave the solution on for a full 10 minutes  it stings and tingles  but this doesn t bother me much  leaving it on this long doesn t cause any hot spots on my skin  either  but my skin is pretty resistant to a lot of environmental insults   i also notice that small blackheads and sebaceous plugs in my forehead and nose will loosen easily and can be pushed or exfoliated out more easily after using this peel      overall  i think this is a good maintenance peel for those who want to slow  or possibly even reverse  the subtle signs of aging  i e  development of melanin pigmentation from sun exposure  smoothing the surface of the epidermis  possibly neutralizing fine lines  and decreasing acne  i will likely continue using this product  until i become adventurous enough to perhaps try something different and stronger  i e  a 70  lactic acid peel   the price is right  too  and won t cost you the overhead you might pay for having the same type of peel done at a medi spa  when i wear this perfume  which i have been wearing for the last 10 years  everyone  i mean everyone from the lady at the convience store to the check in clerk at the airport asks me what i m wearing and tells me how fabulous i smell  this perfume is so unique because it is not mass marketed still to this day  my bottle has been held by the creator while she poured my perfume into it  that is unique and special right there   love this perfume    i love this conditioner   it lasts long and its a great detangler for african american hair   i detangle my hair while the conditioner is in it and it and it stays that way once i wash it out  my dentist recommended this system over all others  and i can see why after using it   it feels like you just had your teeth cleaned every time you brush   up until amazon started carrying the product you had no option but to buy it at the dentist office with their marked up price   now  with the price cut in half  i could afford 2 of these for everyone in the house  br    br   the sterilization chamber holds 2 brusheads of either size and angles them towards a sanitation uv lamp  254 nm    the cycle runs 15 minutes which is sufficient to kill anything on the bristles after use   i ve had my brushes over a year now and still am using the origianl lamp   you get two indications that it is working  a flashing led above which goes steady once the process is finished and the chamber has not been opened  then it goes out    plus the philips logo lights up from the uv inside but blocks the harmful rays from escaping by flourescing in the uv glow of the lamp  br    br   this is a good system for children  as it has reminder buzzes on when to move on to the next set of teeth  and has 5 different cycles from gentile to vigorous   my dentist recommended it to me  and i recommend it to anyone who doesnt t want to see their dentist as often  br    br   positives   it charges using an induction charger   meaning there are no exposed wires   a coil hides behind the charging station and a second coil is inside the toothbrush   when they are in close proximity  2  they couple energy from the ac line to the brush under charge   this is a safe method of charging and does not require cords to plug into the brush  br    br   negatives   the system has one li ion battery   once it expires  philips provides a mechanism to use a screwdriver to remove the battery before throwing away the toothbrush  thus guaranteeing you will buy another one   it would have been as easy to put a cap on the bottom allowing you to replace the expired battery at that time and then continue to use the brush electronics  which are very robust  br    br   of all power toothbrushes  this is the most efficient and professional   it s like comparing the new front load washing machines to yesteryear s top load models in efficiency and economics t     of all power toothbrushes  this is the most efficient and professional   it s like comparing the new front load washing machines to yesteryear s top load models in efficiency and economics  very pleased with the product and with amazon s system  found the dryer we wanted  paid a reasonable price   and received it quickly  attached it to the wall easily and found it to work exactly as we wanted  purchased this item because i m needing to transition from no lye relaxed 4b or 4c hair to natural hair  as stated  by many hair professionals of african american hair studies  that grade 4b or 4c hair is prone to dryness and needs plenty of moisture  so  i was looking to wash my hair then press it  but my hair takes hours to air dry  though  it appears dried once i towel dry it    it still retains water  dampness effects my press iron  if my shafts are not free from vapor  therally  well  i will be using and have used this dryer to quick dry my hair and afterwards press it  both heat tools that i have now are of tourmaline and ceramic technology   i believe this system is better because they will ensure least harsh heat on my hair shafts  glad that it adds shine to my hair and i look forward to continuous usage in the future  yes  it s light weight and it s filter is easy to change  br    br   i give it 4 stars so far and leave off one because it s loud when set on high  but it s not bothersome  as with all dryers   i reluctantly purchased this hairdryer after reading all the reviews  i didn t really want to spend that much money when there where hairdryers for significantly less   the good things  quiet and not too heavy   the bad  the heat from the hairdryer is too hot   i ve been blow drying my hair for years and have never had to stop because my scalp felt like it was burning   and  despite the technology it doesn t appear to dry my hair any faster than the old dryer i replaced   one thing i noticed about the reviews of the dryer was that many people who purchase  and love  this have long hair   i do not so i m always drying right around my scalp  maybe if you have long hair  this might be good for you but other than the quietness  i don t see how this is worth spending so much money on  i came from other contry  our contry use only 220 voltage  when i come back to my contry  i want to use this hair dryer  and when i travel abroad  this will be very helpful  good product   buy it  i know this is expensive  but i feel it is worth the money   i had a t3 for 8 years and found it to be superior to other hairdryers   when it finally gave out  i once again checked reports and t3 came out on top   so now i am enjoying my second one   whenever house guests borrow it  they comment on how wonderful it is   it really does dry my hair faster than other dryers   i have small hands and found it to be lighter and easier to handle   my only concern is that the company does not guarantee it if you buy it from amazon   however  i read that amazon will stand behind it   i never had problems with my last one which worked for 8 years  i was happy to buy another elchim dryer   my first one died after about five years of using it regularly   i used my t2000 as a spare until i found a good deal on a new elchim   elchim is far better than the t2000   i have mid to long blond  colored  hair and it dries my colored hair quickly and smoothly   my hair color covers gray hair which is wirey and dry   this dryer gives me the look i want for my hair    long and smooth   amazon had the best price on it   the price was comparable to what my stylist would have paid at a beauty supply store  i ve just purchased this particular dryer of bespoke labs and i am very  very satisfied with the results  i ve decided to purchase it because cuts down drying time tremendously  i had another ionic dryer and its nothing compare to professional t3  my hair does feel dry at all  no breakage  no frizz  the engineering is fantastic  it does what it claims  i can stay this company creates true ceramic  true tourmaline composed items  i have relaxed hair and i hate drying it  it takes up most of my time but not anymore  i used the low setting with a nylon bristle brush and i could believe it  flat shiny moist hair  and when used the my flat irons  it straighten very fast  a breeze  users stay they burn out quickly but it produces salon results each time over  you ve already saved hundreds of dollars compared to the times used in total  i will be purchasing their flat irons  curling irons  i am bespoke brand loyal now  then won me over  purchased this as a direct replacement of the unit mounted in my motorhome from factory   this is a direct replacement even though the motorhome is 10 years old   my old unit works great  but latch was starting to fail and handset would fall when traveling  creating possibilities of damage to other parts of bath   we have used the old one lots and have been perfectly satisfied so we expect the same performance from this new unit  also  the new one looks so much better  10yr old hair dryers loose their looks too   the company shipped it fast and all transactions have been great  we are very satisfied  handy product for b   bs and for those who get up in the middle of the night since it has a night light  the andis 33805 micro turbo 1600w dual voltage hair dryer is great for travel and everyday use  and is lightweight  powerful  small  packable  works great    i have three  oldest of which is 4 years old   the reason i chose this one was because of the 3 attached parts  they looked great and useful   but turned out those cannot be attached    all three always falled down after  15 seconds  so no use at all   this dryer is a little heavy but acceptable because the air is powerful enough to make the hair dry fast    overall  i am very disappointed for the special features  its design has a major problem  should make it just as the bottle top     updates 2 21 11  after 7 months  it is not hot enough  just a little more than warm   my old travel dryer is even better than this  despite the hype on this product  do not expect less frizz   it is not one of those specifically ionic ones   my sister who has used this product and some cheap ionic one  said that she had better results with other blow dryers   ionic blow dryers give my thick hair a smoother  healthier result  but this blow dryer does no wonders       blow drying time is also not very short  i have long  semi thick hair and it takes forever to blow dry     air dry only takes slightly more than double the blow dry time    can you blame me for not liking to use this blow dryer     i like the cool setting  but other than that  nothing cool   i can t believe i invested into this blow dryer       on the other hand  it seems to be reliable and may last a while     but all of my cheaper blow dryers did last a while also  in fact  i still have them but i wanted an upgrade      i like the separate vent cleaner   no more clogged vents   that feature and the easy to use cool feature make this product better than my previous cheap one   i feel that this was a poor investment       i have no idea how the other reviewers got great results  but my great results came with great products  i was so excited to receive this hair dryer when it came in the mail   well if you have fine straight hair do yourself a favor  don t purchase this  my  beautiful blond hair is so limp from it that it has become a waste of time using it  i tried numerous times not to put anything in it such as styling  products but it did not make a difference   my girlfriend who has thick curly hair whom i considered just giving it to her if she liked it said she  didn t like it at all  it s too late to return it which is definitely my own fault  i am looking for something else to replace it with but i am a little  hesitant to purchase over the internet  this hairdryer is the best i ve had yet   its not too noisy  its not too weak or too strong and is very lightweight   i blow dry my hair with a brush and it takes about 15mins and because its so light my arms never get tired   i would buy it again  i did not purchase my dryer from amazon   however after 2years it just stopped working   thank goodness i purchased from authorized retailer   i had no issues with the warranty process   received a replacement dryer from t3  although it did take a couple weeks    this is a great dryer  i am very happy with it s performance   the warranty process   i rated low to warn amazon shoppers to make sure when you purchase this item the serial   tag is afixed to the cord   it is absolutely necessary for a warranty situation   i purchase tons of things on amazon   i was disappointed to hear of the others having issues since amazon is not an authorized t3 retailer   make sure you do your research on this one before you decide where to purchase  i would definitely recommend the product itself  i have a calcium deposit in my right shoulder and am right handed  i really cant hold my blow dryer up anymore  i also am sick of holding it while styling with a brush with my other hand       its a pain  no pun intended  i bought the blo   go and i cant say enough as to how easy and convenient it has been for me  it took a few approaches with getting it on the mirror at first  you have to really push forward with a good amount of pressure on the suction area and then with the other hand press down the lever  but once you get the knack it really works  i have had it up on my mirror for a year  i just stand under it  turn it on and style or dry  you don t really know you need something like this until you used it  one of those products that every woman should have or great gift  i really do love it  i have used this product before and it is so great that i bought it for gifts  don t let the price scare you off it is worth every dollar  your hair will dry in half the time of other dryers but most important it will not damage your hair like most other  dryers  your hair will stay healthy and will shine found the best price on amazon  it was half the price i found elsewhere  i bought this hairdryer and when i came home and plugged it in  it began to smoke   i brought it back to ulta  and they graciously replaced it after seeing the smoke for themselves   loved the second one  same hairdryer   but it comletely died within 6 months   would not turn on   works well  while it works   otherwise   a cheap hunk of plastic   i m not going back for round 3  this product has been awesome so far  it dries my hair quicker than regular dryers  love it  i was traveling on business and came across this hair dryer at the hotel   i literally ordered one from my hotel room  immediately after using the dryer   works really well  love the fact that it folds up and has a retractable cord   great space saver  this drier gives me another proof that how amazon com helps me find the best product     simple design  great quality  compact form factor  for  14 you simply cannot find a better one  i never knew a blowdryer could be this wonderful  i should have invested in it years ago and saved all that money on straighteners and fancy products that i bought to compensate for crappy blowdryers  now i know  i ordered this dryer specifically for the diffuser shown in the picture  instead of the diffuser  it came with a cheap hair brush that you could purchase at a dollar store     i was surprised to see how fast this dryer was shipped  i was looking for a small hand held drier due to haveing ra in both wrists i have a very hard time useing a bigger hand drier  this drier was the perfect size for me  excellent little dryer  but i would caution you that the high setting does not work in europe  very light weight   dries my shoulder length thick hair very fast   almost half the time my old hair dryer   the red color is cool   discovered the andis brand while staying in a marriott recently and really liked that one   this is an upgraded version   i ve read that some people think that it s loud but i don t notice it   sounds just like the ones in the salon to me  this is a cool and very light blow dryer  its light and its light and its very light  its may be not as powerful as some blow dryers but its pretty strong and yes its very light i bought this hari dryer about 2 5 years ago  i liked the fact that it was mounted and had the night light  it was never the most powerful hairdryer but i generally only dry my bangs and just fluff the water off the top of the curls  so i wasn t that worried about it  if i was pulling and straightening my hair every day  this would not have been enough power  that said  it worked fine for what i needed  however  today it started to spark  this is not hard wired  its just a plug in model  i was pretty surprised because it gave no other indication that it was wearing out  i would expect most hair dryers that are used lightly to last longer than this  too bad      considering the higher price tag for the wall mounted version and the short life of the product  i would not buy it again  this hairdryer is relatively quiet  however  the cord does not retract all the way that it should  i have had other retractable hair dryers that did not have a problem retracting  until i broke off the button     it s better than not retracting  but there s a good 8 inches left after its retracted                     jan 2011  the hairdryer died on me   most hairdryers will last a couple years  this only lasted 7 months  this hairdryer quit working within one month   it gets hot  but the blower does not come on   probably a fire hazard   this is our second one of these  the first quit working within the first year  the best hair dryer i ve ever used  cut my drying time in half and i have a lot of hair  i love love love this blowdryer  it not heavy    doesnt create alot of heat to damage the hair    im african american so its hard to find a dryer that wone fry my hair    it leaves it feeling light and airy  i moved and left my hair dryer so i ordered a new one the same as i had but improved   it works good it is easy to use  and looks better than the old one   clark i received the product on time  no problems are noted so far  i mainly use it for deep conditioning and to speed up the drying process of twist outs  recently i used the brush attachment to blow out my hair  i used both high and low settings  it worked amazingly  if your a natural  you definitely should own this product  it has surely put some smiles on my face  this is the best hair dryer i have ever bought   it has cut my drying time in half and it is so much quieter than any other dryer i have ever used   it was worth every penny      i have owned an andis hair dryer before and loved it  i had to leave it when i sold my home   i quickly ordered a new one for my present home  a slightly upgraded version  and am extremely pleased   it is very quiet and the nightlight is very useful during the night   i would highly recommend this dryer  a few years ago  i used a first class hair dryer that was provided in the marriott hotel and loved it  when i got home  i found this one on amazon and ordered it  i love this hair dryer  i use it all the time   not just when traveling  it s light weight so my arms don t get tired  and it blow dries my short haircut very quickly   about 5 mins with styling  i also like that it doesn t have that long blower on it which is harder for me to use for some reason  i saw the review about it not working right in spain  but i was very pleased with how it worked in greece  there is a screwlike switch you have to turn for european voltage and i wonder if the previous reviewer did not realize this  when the hair dryer is set to european voltage  there is only one speed  high   instead of the usual high and low  and i was pleasantly surprised that the hair dryer worked perfectly in greece  just as it did at home   same strength and heat  the only maintenance was to clean the filter with an old toothbrush once in awhile as it would get covered with lint from hair products i use and then the dryer would overheat   but this is something i have to do with any hairdryer i purchase  after being used everyday for about three years  it s starting to sound as if the motor is going and so i m back to buy another one  my daughter tried mine and liked it so much  she got one also  we both prefer this hairdryer to many other more expensive ones we ve tried through the years  i highly recommend this hairdryer  this hair dryer is smaller than i expected however i am impressed  the sound is not that ear pearcing scream small hair dryers make  the air flow and options are ideal  its a small blow dryer but it does the job great like a bigger blow dryer would in this case size does not matter because it does the job  very cheap  not much blowing power and very little heat  i can not recommend this product  i forgot to mention it is also very noisy  spend a little more money and get you a good one    david ohio i have been looking for a small  low voltage  hair dryer for some time  went to napa with some friends  and this hair dryer was in the hotel  i used it  loved it  wrote down the name and found it at amazon com  ordered it and it came within days  i have thin hair  and this is best for me  it is great to have this     just like the hotels   a very nice perk at a very reasonable price   extremely convenient   no longer do i need to leave the house with my wet hair because it is somewhat inconvenient to reach my husband s plug in for the hair dryer   usually  i would just say  forget about it      love the product  this hair dryer is quiet and does a good job  we bought it because we liked the ones at motels and timeshares we had seen and wanted one like them  the night light is quite bright almost too bright for us   the air flow is quiet and does a good job but does not offer separate heat  air controls  overall we are pleased with it  this hair dryer seemed to perform ok for a few months  but then it caught on fire   seems like manufacturers of electrical appliances could prevent fires   just good thing my wife didn t get burned in the process  i shopped around to compare prices on this conair hairdryer and this was a steal    it is pretty good and it is a tourmaline ceramic hairdryer with the standard attachments  there might be more efficient more powerful hairdryers out there but you will also pay at least 4 times this price  the hair dryer is efficient and easy to use   it has enough power to dry one s hair in a very short time without being too hot to bear  i have always bought conair dryers   the one i was currently using was 12yrs old and finally bit the dust   so i decided to buy the silverbird   wow  my hair is below the middle of my back and usually took 20 minutes to dry   with the silverbird  it took 7 and my chemically treated hair was so shiny and smooth  i can t quit touching it haha   definitely worth it  and to think i almost dropped  100 on a solano  bought this for my wife for christmas and she has been using it on daily basis  i am glad that she loves it  when my old remington dryer that is 7 years old broke i started looking for a replacement  needless to say i ended up returning 4 dryers before i found this one  i loved my old dryer because it was so quiet  i can t stand the dryers that have a high pitched whining noise  so i called remington   they told me this was the quietest dryer they make  they measure by decibels   this dryer had the lowest   so i bought it   it is super quiet  the motor doesn t really give off any noise the only sound you hear is the airflow  and the airflow on this dryer is super strong  its much stronger than my last dryer so it does dry your hair pretty quick  i am very pleased with this product  it comes with a 4 year warranty too  the hot setting is hot but its nice because it doesn t get hot enough wear it feels like its burning your scalp  i actually bought mine at walmart online for  27  it was such a great deal  i highly recommend this dryer  its great  been taking it for a couple of months now  and it s most definitely working for me  i purchased this for a rental house we have  but used it myself when i installed it  it works great  lots of power  dried my hair quickly   and that s saying something since my hair is usually slow to dry  installed quickly as well  i thought the cord could be a titch longer but i didn t feel it was so short that i couldn t comfortably stand away from the dryer to be in front of the mirror  overall  a great product for a great price  br    br   update  it s now been 9 months since i purchased and installed these in our rental home  and they still  after heavy usage  work great  no signs of wear and tear or less power or any problems to report  unlike other stretchers  this one will only widen your shoes  not make them longer   this isn t made clear in the description   it s still well made and i was creative enough to make it work  but if you re looking to stretch a shoe length wise this probably isn t your best option  i bought this razor for my dad who decided to switch to electric shaving at age 97   it works really great for him  shaves beautifully and is well designed   you will not be disappointed with this shaver  i have frizzy thick hair and using this product makes it more manageable  adds shine and softness   not oily heavy   love it  i have been using this product for over ten years  switched to others briefly in that time but nothing compares   i was sold on it way back in the beginning when i d been using it a few months and some women commented across a room that my face glows  i knew it was the healthy skin lotion and have never parted ways with it since  i am 40 now and honestly get told a lot that i look to be in my mid late 20 s  a lot of that is staying out of the sun and this lotion  the only complaint i have about it is the scent  all these years later and i have always hoped badly that they would change it but they never have  i honestly dislike it but the lotion is so good that i still use it  amazing product   the wooden sticks on these swabs break frequently   there is not much cotton on the tip   the 6 inch version work much better     asin b000gulsl4 cotton applicators puritan non sterile 6   100 pkg   so since this isn t sold by amazon  i m mainly reviewing the seller  wish4star   br    br   i received this order in a timely fashion  it s shipped standard usps and so took a few days    maybe 5 or so   all the items in the pic showed up and the packaging was compact and secure  br    br   however  upon going through all the razors  great selection of blades btw   i noticed that one box had been opened and a razor had been opened  yuck   so i contacted the seller and he assured me this had never happened before  i have a feeling he s telling the truth  and that he would send me a new box asap  well i just received my replacements  yeah he sent an extra pack    which showed up quite quickly  br    br   so all in all i trust this seller   had a very positive experience with him  i will most likely be purchasing in bulk from him once i settle on a single brand of razor  this product was in good condition when i received it  shipping was nominal  thank you  this product gave me definite results unlike many products where it s a gradual color  after one application  i look like i ve spent a day at the beach which is exactly what i wanted to achieve  it s not greasy or sticky which is great  it dries quickly  no annoying scent  you must wear gloves  fairly easy to apply and looks even   great product   i m sold  these pony tail holders are a good strong weight to hold my heavy hair without breaking hair  the item arrived in 3 days from across the country  it is just a described  good quality  this store is so great because they don t charge shipping fee  other web sites charged a fee equal to or even more than the cost of the product  i recommend this store and the product  i ve been using this for about a month   not greasy  it moisturizes and puts a good dark brown tone in  product is a nice beigey gloss cannot find it in the stores anymore so i came to amazon i recently purchased   asin b000q6v1ug remington h 2050 t studio ceramic heated clip hair rollers with tourmaline   and found that the heated clips with these remington rollers did not hold the roller in place  unless i stayed really still  and that s not going to happen in the a m  br   the heated clip that remington has is a great concept  but the smooth  heated surface also makes it more slippery on dry hair   so i ordered these conair clips because they said they were large  and could withstand heat   so now in addition to my heated clips  or in leiu of   these were the perfect answer   you can t heat these clips in the remington unit  but they can withstand the very hot velour rollers  as well as blow dryer heat   they also can hold a jumbo size roller  large enough a roller for someone like me with really long and crazy curly hair that needs to be tamed  no slipping at all  and no crease marks with rollers  packaging was excellent  this is exactly what i was looking for  great for day time  using light colors  and for night time of course using dark shades  this is a great product with great price  br    br   i originally wanted to by bare escentuals eye shadows but they are bit expensive  especially if you are not going to use such eye shadows that are needed for  pakistani indian wedding  parties  then do not buy something expensive as mac or bare escentuals  no doubt mac and be got great makeup but its too expensive  br    br   so i definitely recommend this makeup because its good  stays on and great price  too powerful on high  not powerful enough on other settings  needs a additional setting  extra features  nano technology  ion  etc   do nothing to change the look or health of my hair  the diffuser doesn t make my hair curly wavy   but the one on my old hair dryer did   going to try and return  tom s is a small company  employing fewer than two hundred people  it was founded in 1970 and then purchased by colgate in 2006  fortunately  colgate has left tom s alone to manage their business according to their original principles  br    br   tom s makes natural products  the toothpaste contains no sugar  sweeteners  or artificial flavoring  by contrast  i looked at a tube of colgate toothpaste that i have on the shelf  it contains flavor  whatever that is  saccharine  and propylene glycol  the last ingredient is a less toxic form of anti freeze  one advantage of tom s toothpaste is that we do not have to worry about ingesting poisons when we use it  br    br   i have been using tom s for years  the toothpaste comes in many flavors  on amazon  you can find peppermint  spearmint  fennel  orange mango  cinnamint  wintermint  apricot  soothing mint  true mint  and gingermint  among others  i prefer the peppermint flavor  which is refreshing  but not overwhelming  the toothpaste is available in sizes from 1 ounce to 6 ounces  br    br   i do not exactly live in a wilderness area  but my local stores no longer carry tom s  fortunately  it can be found on amazon and other web sites  the prices do vary from vendor to vendor  so check for the best price  about spinbrush  swirl  electric toothbrush by arm   hammer   so i was trying to figure out how to change the battery s for this toothbrush     for a long time   lol too long  and i was feelin  a bit dumb  lol   i had  always had a problem with the switch with the  arm   hammer spinbrush  swirl   tooth brush   it was easy to turn on but it was actually a puzzle  not intuitive  to me anyway  to shut off  lol   i knew the design of this t brush had out smarted me in the past so putting ego aside i went to the web with my problem and to the electric tooth brush manufacture s site       by arm   hammer  i must say this is very flash e web site   lol  very typical  over the top   big company stuff  designed for the suit client not the toothbrush customer  the web sit does not have a site search field  i knew i was in for it right then   yes there is a q   a page but there is a lame ask us page that is really just a badly titled where to buy landing page            it seems like you need to go two levels of pages in on this site to discover this page link found on the ask us page        on the  faq page  how to change the battery for this model spinbrush  swirl  was an unanswered question  others yes full and complete how to s  but not for this model  curious  which led me to amazon to see what others knew about the arm    and  hammer spinbrush  swirl   i found my answer at amazon  it seems instead of just saying that you have to toss this thing in the landfill where it will last for who know s how long the a h approach is omission  just not talking about the issue with their customers  it was almost like they were too embarrassed to put in writing the truth about such an un ecofriendly electric tooth brush  lessons i learned  i wasted a lot of time  i found the solution to my problem very quickly on amazon    i got what i paid for when i bought the cheapest electric toothbrush i could find  i am embarrassed to put this in the garbage but that s where it is  my last one was a sunbeam  it lasted 2 3 years  my latest jerdon stopped working after 6 months  bummer  it sparked then stopped completely  the dryer didnt have anything preventing it from working  no build up   i plugged it in recently and the lightest setting works but that s it  i bought this to take on spring break and it was great  it was very humid in cancun and it dried my hair very fast  i have shoulder length hair and it dried it in about 3 minutes  it is great that it folds up  it makes it nice and small to fit in my tiny bathroom drawer  the cord retracts correctly most of the time  but can be pushed in manually  i keep this dryer in my bathroom and my gigantic  expensive one in my bedroom  i much prefer this one  i love this little blow dryer   it drys my hair super fast  light weight  is up and out of the way   and a great price   buy more than one  and give as a gift   great price and it works great too   keeps bathroom neat and counter clear  it has a very short cord that runs to the outlet which can be good for some and bad for others  i really like the three speeds   i m going to order another for our other bathroom  like many others  i have always used cheap hair dryers from target or the drug store and assumed most hair dryers were the same  my husband always complained about how loud they were and how long they ran for so he bought me the fhi nano pro for valentine s day  in pink of course   it is amazing and so much more quiet  my thick hair dries in half the time and has much more sheen to it  it has also cut down on the amount of time to flat iron it and extended time between washes  i think i will be adding the fhi pro flat iron to my collection too  i would highly recommend it even thought it is more money than i ever thought i would pay for a hair dryer  i bought this hair dryer a couple of months ago and really love it   i had read the reviews about the cord not being a spiral stretch cord and that is why i bought this one   i have a linen closet next to my vanity and there is a plug in inside the closet   i hang the dryer in there out of sight so when i take it out to use  it has a much longer cord then a spiral cord and i need the extra length to reach my vanity so it works perfect for me   so if you are looking for the spiral cord do not buy this unit  but if you need a longer cord this is the one for you  this dryer may do all the positive things everyone talks about  but the button to turn the thing on and off is in exactly the position that you would hold it to dry your hair  so you are constantly pushing it off by mistake   that in itself is so frustrating that i can t see why everyone thinks that this thing is so great  i bought this for the retractable cord  used it barely three times a month since i got it  and the cord stopped retracting  still a decent buy if you get it on sale  since it works as an ionic dryer should  would have been perfect if it came with a diffuser and the retractable cord hadn t stopped retracting in less than a year with limited use  excelente  this dryer is light  strong  it makes hair shine  cuts half of the time of drying  i m a professional and i definetely recomend it for professionals  i have been wanting a wall mounted hair dryer for a long time and this was the only one i found that had a cool setting  at least i thought it had a cool setting since the cool button is pictured and it is in the description  but when it arrived today it was the same model   that i ordered but the product is not the same  very disapointed  this is a great color and an unbelievable price for this product   it s quieter than my last hair dryer  which is a huge bonus   it does smell funny when drying for about the first two weeks  but then it s fine   i ve recommended this hair dryer to others i know  this is a great little dryer  it dried my thick curly hair straight in 10 mins and it came out smooth and shiny however  i was surprised at how heavy this little dryer is  the weight of this dryer was just a bit too much for me and it bothered me in only 10 mins of use and i m not exactly a weakling  the sedu revolution green 3600 hair dryer actually dried my hair in close to half the time 6 mins   as this one even though the watts are a little lower  it seems just as powerful if not more and it looked just as good  also  the sedu green dryer seems much lighter to me and slightly less loud which made it much more enjoyable to use  the 4000 is a great powerful little dryer but i am in love with the sedu green 3600 dryer and recommend that dryer over this one  the heating element in this hair dryer stopped working after three uses  i am in a protracted effort to get a replacement  although from reading other reviews it does not appear that the replacement will be any better than the original  do not buy this hair dryer  it is unreliable  i think pretty much all has been said in the above reviews  it dries hair quickly  but doesn t damage it by being too hot  nor does it make it frizzy  it is not too loud   it is not exactly quiet  but nothing dramatic  it is not too heavy either  and it s a good deal  i have had it since a month and i actually go through the trouble of blowdrying my hair much more often now  because my hair looks so nice now   well  not that i was a monster before   this is my second t3 featherweight hair dryer in 3 1 2 years  as the second one is a replacement for the first featherweight that stopped working   i have always bought the cheap hair dryers at my local chain stores   i had no idea what a difference a high quality hair dryer would make on my hair   i have long hair  about to the middle my shoulder blades  and whenever i have to dry it i have to follow up with a straightening iron   i am pleased to report that with the t3 featherweight i no longer have to use my straightening iron   my hair is straight  silky  and smooth to the touch   i was actually shocked the first time i dried my hair   not only did it look great but it took less time than normal  about 5 minutes less    i do love that this hair dryer is so lightweight and quite     my one and only complaint is that the t3 featherweight hair dryer works for about 1 1 2 years before it shorts out   it has happened twice with two different featherweight dryers   with the featherweight costing me  200 you would think that it would last longer  unfortunately my replacement t3 featherweight hair dryer died yesterday  and it s no longer under warranty   so i bought a different professional brand hoping it will last longer  sorry t3  i had to move on       also to note   when i received my first t3 featherweight hair dryer in 2006   the replacement one in 2008  the company  bespoke labs  had a 4 year warranty on their featherweight hair dryers   now i have noticed that bespoke labs has changed the warranty on this hair dryer to only 2 years     interesting  i was needing a hair dryer that wouldn t throw the breaker when on high and this one is good although it did blow breaker one time but i had too many things going at the time but it hasn t happened since  it is handy to hold and turn on and off or adjust settings with one hand so this is a keeper for me  i love this lightweight blow dryer it is fantastic and it is super quiet and doesn t frizz my hair out  the plug fits into my outlet well  my last blow dryer it hogged u to plug spaces  after reading some reviews on the t3 and hair stylist using this product i committed  it is pricey but worth it to me  this is my second andis  it worked so well when it gave out i ordered another one this past february   hopefully it ll last as long as the first one   a great deal for the price  i bought 2  one for the master bath and one for the kids bath  it has helped with the clutter in the kids bathroom soooo much  and since it s out all the time it reminds my girls to dry their hair   i love it  i would recommend it to anybody with kids  i spent over  100 for a hairdryer   i used it twice and had to return it because it had no heat   i wasn t impressed for over  100  i was looking for a new dryer and spent some time online doing my research   this product was generally well liked so i spent the extra money and purchased it   i m not sure it is as overwhelmingly better than all others  that s a tough claim   but i have to say that it is a pretty good product   i have very thick color treated blonde hair so i have to be careful not to damage it but yet i don t want it to take all day to dry   this dryer allows me to dry my hair very quickly and without damage   i really like the difuser too   it is a bit heavy but that isn t a big deal since i don t take it on trips and my arm doesn t get too tired since it doesn t take too long to dry   overall  i rated four stars because although it isn t perfect  i do really like the performance of this dryer  it does everything it says it will   nice drying  not too hot  very even  and the attachments work well   the heat is very even and it does a good job   this is kind of a cadillac of hair dryers for people who want to pamper their hair   i love it  i got this as a second hair dryer for traveling and to leave at my boyfriend s house so i didn t have to lug my conair 213x infiniti pro  about  40  and much heavier than this one  back and forth every weekend   this was a great choice   the dryer is much much lighter than what i m used to and has a nice smooth feel  as in  it doesn t feel light plastic under my hands  but more of a rubbery feel   very pleasant     it is also just as powerful as the 213x   it has 2 speeds  gale force wind and normal   and 3 heat settings   i use the gale force winds on medium heat and my hair 4 5 below my shoulder  thin medium thickness  is dry in under 3 minutes   my younger sister tried it out and put it on gale force high heat and she said it didn t stay on for more than a few seconds   my thoughts are it could have been my outlet  i live in a very old apartment building   circa 1900s  unable to handle the current flow or it could have been a safety feature of the hair dryer to prevent over heating   either way its not a problem for me since high heat hurts my head and ears and makes me feel as if i m destroying my hair   all in all its a great value for the price  i purchased the olay complete lotion for sensitive skin just looking for a light spf hydrating lotion to wear under makeup that wouldn t totally ruin my skin like everything else  i have super sensitive  fair skin and am slightly acne prone and after trying what seemed like every sensitive product under the sun without success i was desperate   even cetaphil gives me ruddy blemished skin for pete s sake    so my dermatologist suggested i try this olay lotion  she called it the oil of old lady cream ha  and to my delight this stuff worked wonders beyond my wildest dreams  this lotion not only was light  non greasy and proved a great foundation for liquid and powder makeup  but miraculously smoothed my complexion and lightened erased my post blemish marks and general ruddiness  i have received so many compliments on my complexion since using this product it s amazing  i highly recommend this lotion to anyone looking for a complete protection and rejuvenation of the skin and at less than  12 a bottle  who could resist   peroxyl isn t available where i live  the shipment was slower than i expected but arrived at the end of the promised time frame  the product is excellent for gum problems and was recommended by my dentist  it shouldn t be used without a dentist s approval  i thought these rollers were really cute but i ended up giving them away  i dont know if its that the heat is uneven or  or maybe the rollers are too small  or what  but i never got a good bouncy head of softly curled hair out of these   i dont think they heat up particularly quickly  either  they might be good for a kid  i have been using this product for over a year  i have very light  delicate skin and really dislike anything greasy or heavy  hope in a jar  either formulation  is wonderful   light  non greasy  causes no blemishes  i am really surprised by the negative reviews  i am in my 60 s and have tried just about everything on the market   and for the price this product is uncomparable  this lotion turns you brown almost immediately but because it has a bronzer the deep tan doesn t last long unless you go to the tanning bed everyday  but it s good for a quick tan  i m really pleased with this product and hope the dial in this scent will remain available for purchase over time  i use antibacterial liquid pump soap in both kitchen and bath  but prefer a non medicinal and non floral scent  the scent of this is very light and smells exactly like apples in the autumn  with just a light hint of spice in the background  the product lathers up very well  but rinses clean easily  leaving my hands soft and feeling healthy and refreshed  but not at all greasy like a moisturizer usually feels  the scent lingers only for a little while and does not make me feel like i am leaving it behind in foods i prepare after washing my hands  i ve had guests over since i bought this soap and both times they commented on what a lovely scent it had when they washed their hands in the bathroom  this is my favorite so far in any of the types and scents available from standard brands of liquid antibacterial soaps in a pump container  i also love that i could buy in volume at a good price  so as to not run out suddently  i would recommend this product highly for those who prefer antibacterial liquid soaps  but aren t fond of flowery or medicinal scents  when i ordered the anti aging eye roller i thought  yeah sure  this will be like any other product that advertises the reduction of eye bags and puffiness  but  and i mean a big but  i found that it really does reduce the appearance of bags and puffiness   i am glad i tried it and i am glad it is an olay product because i use olay exclusively for face and body   anyway  i would and have recommended this product to others so they can try it and other olay products   i don t mind asking  because i am on a fixed income  for coupons  very substantial coupons for olay products   i also like the regenerist moisturizer which i use at least twice a day   thank you  this eyeliner is the best  it s truly waterproof and yet not flaky  creates a nice solid black line and is very controllable with that nice pointy tipped applicator  br   love it    my boy does not like when i put any cream on his face  he does not mind mustela dermo pediatrics stelaprotect  skin is so smooth and smells lovely  i can only recommend it  i have really dry hair and this product really helps style and hydrate my hair  easy to use  apply before blow dry  i noticed a difference the first time i used it  i have been using it with the moroccanoil  i had purchased this item years ago at an origins store  not even noticing the brand name  i wanted to replace it and when i saw this on amazon i was thrilled  this is such a great handy thing to use for lotion  my husband hates me asking him to lotion my back  so this is great  and washable which i love  i also use an oil for sore back muscles sometimes and i can use this to apply it myself  great item  i used the roller on a facail scar i have that i cover with makeup  it is not deep but im very self conscious of it  i used the roller on it as instrusted but found that it actually made the area rolled more scar like  red and leathery  i would not advise using this on scars  this little tin full of solid perfume arrived quickly  is packaged nicely  is really handy for purse or gym bag  it smells great  my only wish is that smell would last longer  i was hoping a solid perfume could do so  after about 1 2 hour the smell is gone  this is my second mb 200 that i ve owned   the first one was amazingly convenient   it held a charge for around a month   with no accessories  it was great for traveling   unfortunally my cats knocked it off of the sink with the guard extended   it broke a small piece inside and the guard doesn t work anymore   so i suggest to store it with the guard all the way in so that can t happen   other than that  i m completely satisfied  i have avon s haiku perfume and i absolutely love it  i received the powder as a gift and it s the same wonderful scent  i have not purchased from this seller  so that s all up you  those of you who worry about the  shimmer  as the others state  it is very very light  to be honest  i just started using the powder again and i didn t notice the shimmer  i recommend applying non scented lotion then the powder after you get out of the shower  1  great smell br   2  excellent cleaner  even stubborn mascara without irritation br   3  reduces pore size br   4  makes your moisturizer work better br   5  makes your make up glide on br    br   purchase it  this cream works very nicely on my eyes  i mainly bought it because it has the copper peptides that everyone seems to be raving about  i see some improvements however  i think that with any skin care products you need to give it a few months to see true results also i noticed that this cream can irritate so make sure you put only a little  i went crazy putting on extra daily out of desperation lol and i felt a burning irritation around my eyes  still a good cream but you may want to shop around to see what else is out there  mine came yesterday and it is perfect   i was looking for a lighted magnifying mirror that would wall mount and i didn t want to pay an arm and a leg for it   this was under  60 and it is all i could ask for   i bought the chrome   it really does the job   thanks for providing such a superior product at such a great price  this is a worthy product from a notable seller   the customer service is superb  shipping is quick  and the minoxidil solution has offered personal results that i haven t seen with 5  solutions   i ve used other 15  solutions  and this is the one i choose by preference   the azelaic acid is a theoretical dht inhibitor  testosterone conversion to dht production is the absolute cause of the hair follicle demise    aka hair loss   and combined with the 15  minoxidil mixture  the solution offers the possibility of solid regrowth    honestly  i ve used this product  in combination with additional regrowth methods  and am receiving results that i have not had in the past using other regrowth combinations  i ve used this 15  solution for roughly 5 6 months    i began thinning in my early 20 s and by 25 was shaving my head  which  i didn t mind so much but wasn t completely doing so by preference    i m currently 29  and my hair is gaining the density as it once was at 18   i recommend the product  this simply felt like a lighter petroleum jelly and was in a tube  been using it for a week and notice no difference  easily wears off in five minutes  clinique s lip scrub made my lips feel better  i ve been using this mirror for ten to fifteen years   recently  the bulbs went out and i discovered that there s no easy way to replace them  so it seemed worth it to just buy a new mirror   actually  this one is a little bit better   i think that lighting technology has changed a bit since i last bought it and the lever that changes the lighting is smoother   my last one became very difficult to move and it eventually broke off every time i tried to move it  br    br   all in all  the option to change the lighting is fantastic and it gives off plenty of light to be able to do my makeup in low light situations   i m hoping it will last another ten to fifteen years  this is well worth the money  i have thick hair so sometimes it doesn not want to hold the style that i wish is to hold but the chi ceramic flat iron works better than most other flat irons i have used and and leaves my hair silky and smooth   so far i have not noticed any hair damage or breakage  a big plus  i have heard about enjoy products a few times  and it was recommended by my hairstylist  i still went out on a limb by ordering this pomade  but i love it    i have long straight hair  but after i blowdry straighten it  it s still a little frizzy and i have flyaways  this pomade helps a ton  you only need about the size of a nickel  and you can use it from root to tip without it looking oily  of course if you use too much  that might not be the case    also  is smells soooo great  the price is good  i can see it lasting for a long time since a little goes a long way  i would definitely recommend this product to anyone with the same need as i had      pretty durable body if closed   magnification  is pretty clear   don t like that there were  1x 10x stickers on the mirror  i ve been using the sonicare for many  many years  probably 15 years  when they first came out   i have the advance handle and philips no longer makes replacement heads for the advance handles but instead has a slightly different head called e series that is supposed to fit the advance handle   i ordered the three pack of the e series and it does fit the original advance handle but be advised that he makes a louder noise when in use   apparently  the magnets on the e series  don t match what was originally designed for the advance handles   i called philips and demonstrated the noise difference over the phone to the technician and even she could tell the significant difference in noise   it s not unbareable by any stretch but is not as comfortable as using the old replacement heads   the technician did not know about the difference in noise  checked with others and then got back to me that  yes  there is a difference in noise   philips should tell the user about this difference   it s no big deal  but should be disclosed  br    br   what i found interesting also is that the new package says to replace the heads every 3 months   the old packaging said every 6 months   when i asked the technician about this and asked if this meant that the new heads were not made as well as the old heads and was this part of the american corporate conspiracy to have consumers buy more and spend more  she said they changed the recommendation on the advice of dental professionals   whether these dental professionals are part of the conspiracy  i do not know   whether the new heads are not as well built as the old  i also don t know   but in any event  since i ve been using the sonicare for the past 15 years or so i ve changed heads every six months or so and my teeth have not fallen out and i ve had no complaints from my dentist   i guess i ll update this review four months from now and advise whether my teeth have fallen out and are full of cavities all because i didn t change the replacement head after three months  br    br   but to philips credit  at least they didn t simply stop making a head to fit the advance handle and thereby force the consumer to buy a new handle for the new heads   the e series does fit  albeit not perfectly  br    br   stay tuned e replacement head after three months     but to philips credit  at least they didn t simply stop making a head to fit the advance handle and thereby force the consumer to buy a new handle for the new heads   the e series does fit  albeit not perfectly     stay tuned  the dryer overheats and shuts off and cannot be reset  you have to wait until it cools down on its own or only use it on a low heat setting   the tube that connects the bonnet is not very durable   conair could do better   my last two conair dryers have not lasted   i can t recommend this item     and note   i bought this unit from a store  not amazon  so conair cannot blame their lack of quality on amazon  i didn t know what the attachments were for so i threw them out   i turned it on and it blew hot air   5 stars  this drier has been working great for me for the last few months and i m pretty sure i am using it harder than most   i have it out at the barn with my horse and use it it dry him off after a workout and a bath   this means that while it is only working on short hair  it has a lot of surface area to cover and it holds up the whole time   only bad thing i have to say is that the less than ideal environment with lots of dirt has caused me to see a fleck of rust or two on the front grill  but they don t  seem to be spreading and they haven t given me any trouble  i originally bought this model hangup hair dryer because of the cord hanger  in all honesty  i never use the hanger  i leave my cord dangle  it actually helps to detract from the power cord that runs to the outlet  if i hang the cord  i actually feel like that just spreads out the cord mess  that may be something to consider if you are buying this model for the cord hanger     the nighlight is not as bright as some of these reviews would have you believe  if you go from having a completely dark bathroom to having this light  you will notice the room is much brighter at night  but the light is no brighter than any other night light     you will need the right size allen wrench to switch the dryer from 1200w to 1600w as this does not come with the dryer      i had no problems with the screw length for mounting as others have stated  so they may have fixed that problem     this dryer is much quiter than my previous dryer which was an 1875w regular handheld model  it s not silent  but it is quieter than any dryer i ve owned     even though this and other wall mounted dryers have lower wattage  i don t notice a significate increase in drying time  maybe a minute or two   i actually prefer the lower wattage now because i m not blasting my hair  or scalp   with heat which tended to cause split ends and fry my hair after continued use  i don t curl or use a flat iron  so the difference is purely a result of the hair dryers   also  once i finish blow drying  my hair looks like it will for the rest of the day  an moderate amount of volume   whereas with the 1875w dryer  my hair would be a pouf ball first thing in the morning and gradually flatten to my head by the end of the day      other notes  the dryer itself is a medium size  i like that it s not one of the tiny ones because i feel like it s not flimsy and weak  even if smaller ones really aren t   it s also not as big and heavy as full sized dryers  so i find that i move it around much more and get more even drying  i bought this dryer because my hairdresser has one like it   i have naturally curly hair that i straighten  this dryer is awesome   it dries hair quicker than most  leaving no frizz in the hair   my hair feels smoother and healthier after using it   i would recommend this product to everyone   some of the reviews that i read on here before purchasing  said that a lot of people didn t like the controls because their hand would hit it and just turn it off  i don t understand this  if you hold it in your hand the right way  it works fine without hitting the controls  this product is of good quality for a very good price  also  lightweight and not too noisy  i have owned several wall mount dryers and they seem to be chintzy   overly small and too hot  way too hot to dry my kids  hair   this one is a bit bigger  feels great in the hand and has a little switch you can set to make it run either warm or hot   my kids no longer scream and yell when i dry their hair   it has plenty of power and it looks good too   the only drawbacks are the length of the cord  could be a tad longer   and the back vent sometimes pulls a hair or two   neither are deal breakers   i m very happy with this dryer  i usually love amazon and buy a lot of cd s  books  etc  don t buy this hairdryer from any discount supplier  i bought one  expected a genuine article  didn t get a manufacturer s warranty and am stuck with a dryer that doesn t get hot  i contacted the seller  and because i was certain this was authentic  i threw the box away and now i m on the hook for  100 plus  do not buy from anyone other than a seller who can provide a warranty from the manufacturer  these dryers have a tendency after a couple of years to burn up  my last one shorted right at my vanity  scary  get the warranty  please  i have this dryer but it s currently mounted to my wall  unused  because it burned out after two years of mostly daily use  still  i love the style and plan to get another one  we ve all used the wall mounted blow dryers in hotels  and then gone home to the unit sitting on the counter top in our bathroom   i finally broke down and purchased this wall mounted unit and put it in my wife s bathroom   it only took a couple of minutes to install the mounting plate with the supplied hardware   what a difference   no more cords dangling in the sink and knocking items on the floor   i chose this model because it has a removable filter to allow easier cleaning   my feelings about blow dryers is that they re pretty much all the same within price ranges   i don t expect a  35 item to last 10 years      i will happily replace it when it wears out   this one works fine and i don t have any complaints   i d buy it again tomorrow if faced with the same need and happily recommend it to anyone who s considering a purchase  this dryer has good power   my hair comes out good  thin straight hair   it s a bit heavy so it wouldn t be good for someone with gripping or strength concerns  the on off and heat buttons are not placed well  i accidentally turn the dryer off several times while i m drying my hair  but that is only a minor inconvenience   100  is a lot to pay for a hair dryer that only lasts for 9 months  don t bother  if you want to spend the money on a high end hair dryer  make sure it has a guarantee  this one does not  i bought this product almost 3 years ago   it is so nice to be hands free and feel confident it will stick to the counter  or glass    i recently bought it as a gift for my mom   she loves it  fits the bill perfectly  i sought a small  efficient hair dryer that could hang up in my very small bathroom and be unobtrusive but effective   the cord   hanger is a plus  allows the coiled cord to be placed out of the way   i disagree with some reviewers who found it very noisy on high setting  this dryer is just fine  i saw this at my sister in laws  she has one in each bathroom and loved it  its out of the way and always neat looking  it has lots of power for no bigger than it is and just a nice addition to my bathroom  convenient but out of the way also  power cord is long enough but not too long  love it  love it  love it   this hair dryer has worked wonders  i am in the process of transitioning from relaxed to natural and this product creates lovely results  leaves hair straight with a lovely sheen  also  it takes maybe 5 10 minutes to dry hair  this hairdryer is fantastic  it is powerful  which means it dries fast  lightweight  and includes many different settings  the extra attachments also help for different types of drying  although other reviews say it is heavy and bulky  the andis hairdryer is far from it  i would recommend it for anyone  the plastic switch that holds the hard hat up is kind of flimsy  don t move around too much while you re underneath the hood and you ll be fine  if they can redesign the hood lock on this device  it d be a five star item  because my roller sets come out swell when using it  i had been looking for a small and powerful hair dryer that would do the job and i could put away with out taking to much room   in this conair bonnet hair dryer i found it  it s small  sleek and powerful   love this hair dryer and been using for 3 month and had no problem with it  plus could not beat the great price i got it here  i was looking for a dryer that was not an ion dryer or ceramic  these days that is not that easy     i came across this one  had a few good reviews so i thought i d give it a try    i m so glad i did  i ve had this dryer for a little over 2 years    no problems  i use it every single day with a big diffuser on it  i have naturally curly thin hair and must use a diffuser   this dryer works perfectly for me  at first i didnt think i d like the smaller size but quickly got over that  now i love it i take it everywhere   1600 watts is perfect  in fact i love this dryer so much i just bought a second one just in case         try it you will not be disappointed  i bought this for my wife with her long thick hair because she always complained about how her rotary style hair dryer wasn t powerful enough  i was at my barbershop and noticed this was the model my barber used and it blew strong hot air so i decided to get her one and she loves it  i got this for my sister  she absolutely loves it  she does a lot of traveling and is used to a   hairdryer like this  i bought this hair dryer as a christmas present for my girlfreind   she says its the best hair dryer she has ever owned   i highly recommend  my husband  firefighter  had a nasty habit of leaving the blowdryer on the bathroom counter until it cooled off   everytime i walked into the bathroom  there d be the clean counter with the blowdryer sitting on it so i d wind up the cord and put it in the cabinet  everyday   so for christmas  i got hubby this blowdryer and we all love it   colors are not too white  more ivory and light taupe  but very neutral   the kids can all use it easily  5 yrs and up   simple on off button on the base  hi lo on the dryer handle and it gets put away    right away   it took five minutes to hang  we plugged it right into the outlet and i love it  i am very happy with this dryer   all the settings and attachments let me do almost anything with my hair   i have a bad right arm and can t use curlers so this really helped me look presentable  excellent dryer leaves hair puffy and doesnt feel damaged best dryer i have ever used  i bought this hair dryer because i have the larger version that i use at home and i wanted the same quality for when i travel   this packs well and i love the retrackable cord  the conair 1875 hair dryer is powerful and quiet   i m very satified with this purchase  bought as xmas gift for wife  matched the 1600 kw of our previous andis blow dryer   but it lacked the blowing power alot  the light was also very bright on the wall mount  had we kept it i was going to remove the light  did not meet our expectations  so i returned the item to amazon  this is a great dryer for curlie hair   don t forget to clean the filter   i did and the dryer stopped working   so now  i purchased need a new one  this is a great hairdryer for the price   dries my hair quickly  is lighweight  and easy to use   i bought two   one for my wife and one for me   she likes it as much as i do   great purchase  we used this hair dryer in a hotel once and loved it so much we have one in ever bathroom  7  in the house     we live at the beach so when we have company they use the hair dryers and they love them    two of our friends liked them so much they bought one for their houses         don t waste your money buying the hair dryer with the night light  the light won t last long  just buy this one it s the best         maybe like you  i had a huge stylist type hairdryer i d had for years   after moving to a different city and a different job  i no longer needed the super power that this dryer gave me   my hair does better air dried and if you listen to all the stylists in the media  they say blow drying your hair every day would damage it so a quick few seconds for the bangs and i was out the door   with the limited space in our bathroom after moving  the hair dryer took up more space than was warranted for it   sure i wasn t spending another few dollars to buy something i already had  but the frustration of never having a clean looking sink counter had been eating at my peace of mind     after a few trips where the hotel had a wall mounted hair dryer that suited my need just fine  i talked the hubby into putting out the funds for a wall mounted dryer   i hemmed and hawed about which dryer i should buy   mostly  it came down to price and the loop for the cord   didn t need the nightlight  but after a couple of nights  the soft green glow came in handy when waking up in the middle of the night due to cats or a need to use the toilet   even the hubby who is sensitive to light at night was comfortable with it as long as it wasn t facing the bed     the loop on the back is flat and not a circle so you have to hook the cord over it just like in the picture   i had expected it to be a full circle sticking out from the wall  but it sits flush   still  the cord does stay in place so i can t complain   i have a good hair dryer and it s finally off the counter  okay  how could i have lived 63years and never thought of installing a hair dryer on the wall   it s a no brainer   dragging out the hairdryer every day and trying to put it away neatly is a hassle and there is no reason to put up with it any longer   i bought 2 oster 76932 710 and put one up in my bathroom and the other in the spare bath   now when guests come over they compliment me for the nice hotel upgrade   everybody comments on what a good idea     the 710 watt oster is a great dryer and does the job well on my thick hair   the dryer snaps easily in and out of the holder   it took me about 30 minutes to install both dryers   and that included the time it took me to find my drill and try and read 3 16 on the drill bit   buy this   it will only make you happy  i purchased this dryer at target for  20   i use only conair dryers  and know that it is a matter of trying until i find the right one for me when the old one dies       this one is so loud that it hurt my ears   i know that i could have gotten used to it  but decided that it was best not to try     i have thick and fine hair and for some reason the ion dryer really zaps my hair  diminishes the shine       this dries quickly and thoroughly  but the noise and damage to my hair are not worth it   i will go back to a regular conair     i love the brand  but just not this item  none available  i have tried a lot of hair dryers in the last 40 years  this one is  by far  the best i have used  it is pricier than the ones you see in the discount stores  but it is worth every penny you pay for it  i recommend it highly  i ve had mine for a year and a half  it still works great  turned out to be a great purchase  br   3 17 2013 it s been over 3 years and it still works like new  after years of having my hair dryer clutter up the vanity  i now have a very nice dryer attached to the wall   be sure to have near plug in as the cord is short   love this for organization  and it works very well  i purchased this rigid cover hair dryer for my wife   she is very pleased with the results   it works well for her  to clarify the warranty situation  i called discountjungle for information including how they managed to sell this product for 91 dollars  here it is    amazon covers this hairdryer for only 30 days under their warranty    discount jungle covers this product for a full year  if you have a problem within the year  discountjungle will call t3 and handle the warranty claim for you    the reason it is only 91 dollars is b c of the warranty w  discountjungle only being 1 year  instead of the full 4 year warranty through an authorized dealer yea i can agree with everyone s review about how it is heavier than most dryers  it is also much louder too  compared to my old dryer  it sounds like somebody s going through my house with damn leaf blower  they should have 3 speeds on that thing because it doesn t just sound like a leaf blower  it feels like one too  the low on this dryer is my old dryers high  it does do the job when it comes to getting your hair dry fast though      when my wife first said she wanted me to get her this for her birthday  i though she had lost her mind   100 for a hair dryer               well  gotta keep her happy so i got it for her  after her using it for about a year  i must say that it really does work better then the cheaper hair dryers she s been using     her hair tends to get frizzy and this dryer really does solve that problem a lot better the  25 hair dryer she was using before  it seems well constructed  make sure you clean out the filter under the back end cap   it kept stopping every 5 8 minutes   my wife thought it was overheating  but i noticed that the filter was clogged  after cleaning it  the hair dryer was back to normal     i still have a hard time with paying  100 for a hair dryer but i must say that it actually does seem to work better  than normal hair dryers  this is our second unit after 10 years of daily service   the original unit worked fine until the internal fan that pulls air through the unit shattered   we mounted a 2nd unit on the same wall bracket in about 5 seconds and are again happy campers  i bought this for my daughter and am very pleased with my purchase  it is an amazing hair dryer that literally makes your hair softer i would recommend this to anyone  i bought this as a gift for my daughter who is in nursing school  she loves anything that is pink and has the breast cancer logo  she said this is the best dryer she has ever had dries her hair in half the time  she said she loves it and that it is a great dryer  couldn t be more impressed with a blow dryer  the color jumps right out at you  the 2 speeds are average and the heat options work great  heats up really fast   on high is probably too hot for some  have medium short hair  so no need for attachments  but i m sure they would function well if you need them  can t say enough about the color lol  this is very good  i like it  i can select strong  wild  hot and cool style  awesome  this is a very good product   i have been using over a month   it has enough power to blow your hair faster   however  the night light caused everyone a little uncomfortable   the light was too bright when i pluged the power   the only way to turn off light is to press test buttom and press reset buttom when you needed to use  which is very inconvenience   so  i opened the back cover and stick the dark tape on the light screen to reduce the bright light   i wish there is a dimm switch to adjust light  worth evey single penny  does not burn hair  would order another one in a minute if it broke  i will never buy another cheap blow dryer again  this week  our second andis wall mounted dryer burned out   after our first failure  i always checked and cleaned it out on a regular basis   prior to complete unit failure  the internal thermal protection would turn the unit off prior to my wife finishing her hair   it would typically work again the next day   the first one lasted about 3 month  the second one about 8 months   i have another model from a different manufacturer in my bath and it has worked for over 10 years   we purchased this one because of the claim to produce less noise  not really  and the night light   the night light could be too bright for some  but it was ok for us   i just order another wall mount from a different manufacturer   in less than 1 year  i will be  120  for one hair dryer   not good value   plus  i am sure i ll have to make new mounting holes and  patch and repaint over the old ones  used it for about a year now  have had no problems  it was easy to install and works great  keeps counter clear and is ready to use  i love this hair dryer   on vacation i used my sisters   was so impressed that once i got home  i went online   ordered it   this hair dryer is the best i ve ever bought  and i ve had plenty over the years   most hair dryers have a high pitched whine when on high  this one is very quiet  almost whooshing it dry   also  my hair is smoother than it s ever been after being dried  could it really be the fact it is tourmaline or ceramic   no matter  i would highly recommend this brand and this model      buying it through amazon made it much easier since i didn t want to go through the hassle of looking for it  not knowing which stores carried this exact model   price was very competitive  i tried this blowdryer at kimpton hotels in san francisco   forgive me    it blew mind      i have long curly hair that i straighten as i blowdry using a large metal brush  normally  this is a 20 30 minute painstakingly long process  this blowdryer reduced my drying time to 7 minutes    7 minutes     the hot air is very hot  the high speed is very high  i loved this product so much i texted myself the name of it and bought it when i got home  can t say enough    it does overheat  so if you turn it off between sections of hair or something    you might have to wait until it cools a little  but to save 15 20 minutes of my life from blowdrying hell  it s worth it   i have two teenage girl s and we have really put this blow dryer through the test  it works great and dries our hair quickly without the frizz  would highly recommend  worked great   love the retractable cord   then one day  just 10 months after buying it  it just wouldn t turn on   i had to throw it in the trash   my last hair dryer lasted years and years   this sucks  our last andis lasted 3 1 2 years and i think that is pretty good for a much used hair dryer   i love the wall mount and i even like the night light   i highly recommend this dryer to anyone  i looked in the usual stores to replace my other oster wall mounted hair dryer we ve had for about 10yrs and could not find this item   we all love the convenience of not having to store it anywhere and always have it handy next to the vanity where it is needed   it is a great product besides   i definitely will re order this again  superfast shipping   item arrived in new condition as described  very nice hair dryer  very powerful   i was a bit concern about the life of this product but so far so good    i loved this   while it lasted   after 3 weeks  it stopped working   i also was not able to register it with the manufacturer and receive warranty coverage because amazon is not a registered dealer  the seller has agreed to replace it when i mail the product back  just be aware of these potential issues  i bought this dryer about a month ago exclusively for travel  but i like it so well that i ve been using it for my regular one   i like that the retractable cord keeps my counter looking uncluttered  but it doesn t always retract as easily as it should   i sometimes have to coax the cord back in the handle  but to me  it s a tolerable hassle  especially for the price point    the dryer is very powerful   i have a ton of hair and the wattage really minimizes the time it takes me to get my hair dry   the ceramic element also minimizes the static i experience with most other hair dryers   overall  it has a few flaws  but for  19 99 it s a heck of a dryer  br    br   update  i have had this over a year now and it s still going strong after daily use   love this thing  this was definitely worth the purchase  it dries faster than normal hair dryers  best of all  i have had a ton of compliments on how shiny my hair is since i started using it  i bought this hair dryer to replace my previous hot tools hair dryer that had broken after many years of use  this hair dryer is even better than my old one  it is much lighter and still has the same fast drying power of the last one  i take it everywhere because no other hair dryer can dry my long layered hair as quickly and easily  this is a great product  if it can be quieter and smaller  it will be an even better item for home users  i replaced a conair 1600 which was used daily for several years and finally died  i bought this based on the numerous good amazon reviews and because some have said that the 1850 watt dryers might not work outside the u s   delivery was swift  the dryer feels substantial and well built  it dries more quickly than the old conair without hair looking like i stuck my finger in a socket  as was mentioned before  this will dry anything short of a wookie very quickly  highly recommended   10 19 10  just received a second andis 33805 ordered 6 days ago as backup in the event this model 33805 is discontinued  the original has performed flawlessly and continues to feel well built  dual voltage perfect for travel   wonderful size and perfect heat   not too hot as some can be   i make my daughter bring this one when we travel since i love it so much and i leave mine old clunky one at home  i m sure this hair dryer could have been great   i loved my yellowbird but unfortunately  this blackbird would not power on   the original hair dryer got to me in a matter of days but the replacement was going to weeks so i had to cancel it and get a refund   bummer  i also first tried this product while on vacation   this little hair dryer is compact  light  and powerful   the best part  however  is the service i got from this vendor   my order was filled right away  i got it within days  and the price was the best i found by far   thanks  jen     anita  stratford  ct this is the second unit i ve puchased like this  was very pleased with the first one  very handy  no worries about plugging it in since it s hard wired to begin with  the first unit is about five yrs old now with perfect performance       tops st  louis i agree with another user    seemed to work ok at first although i didn t notice much improvment in speed of drying  it is lightweight and easy to handle    but it is hotter than i m used to  after 6 months  my hair started to feel dry and had zero shine  my hair had always been very healthy and shiny before  my hair stylist noticed it and couldn t figure out what was wrong  after about 9 months  i switched back to my old hairdryer and my hair was instantly healthy and shiny again  maybe this hairdryer is good for some people but it was bad for me  and costly      this comment above sums it up for me as well   in the beginning you notice the shine which was great but after a few months i started to notice that my hair was losing it s shine and bounce   i now went back to my old blow dryer that i had in storage and my hair is bouncy again and the shine is coming back slowly but surely   i believe this blow dryer doesn t work for all hair types   my hair is semi curly       darlene a fairly good hairdryer although not very powerful   but adequate for my purposes   the first one i received didn t work at all and had to be returned   this one works fine  but was a little difficult to install   i love the night light   it is very bright  but one can always close the bathroom door if it s bothersome   i would purchase this item again  after 3 1 2 months after purchasing this hair dryer  the unit has burned out   this was not the first time i have experienced this same problem with this same dryer   a year ago i purchased the same dryer and the had the same problem   would i ever buy another andis product   no  this is an excellent blow dryer  i read the reviews before purchasing about how it didn t work right out of the box  same thing happened to me  except that i realized that if you press the red reset button on the plug  it works just fine  my hair dries faster  without over drying  great price  too  i had one before and was lost without it   ordinary blow dryers take longer and don t make my hair look as healthy   i could not wait for my replacement to come  i have natural  color treated  kinky  curly  african american hair  a co worker recommended it for blow outs  she s used it for 3 years twice a week  with no replacements   i ve had the yellow bird for 4 months  and i have no complaints  it has reduced my drying time in half  i love the four different heat settings  cold setting at the end for shine   and  most importantly  the comb is nice and strong  i purchased it at a beauty supply store but i just had to come on here and sing this bird s praises  i am such a fan  br    br   3 23 10     i stilll looooooove the yellow bird  i use it once a week for my hair and it s still going strong  no problems whatsoever  i ve recommended this dryer to about 5 others  they ve all bought it and they love it also  br    br   3 5 13      my yellowbird is still going strong  i use it less on my hair  1 2 times a month   but it s still effective  the only complaint is that i can t order a replacement comb   i dropped the whole unit by mistake and 2 teeth came off on one end  i still use the comb  i just divide my hair in smaller sections so that my hair doesn t pass through the end with the broken teeth  i bought this for my wife just before a trip to greece   it worked flawlessly both here and there   she combined it with a universal plug system from aaa and found no flaws on either in the us or in europe    asin b0017wnhyg turbo power twin turbo 2600 hair dryer   i bought this for my mom s beauty salon  she had some of these but they were worn out  so basically she knew what to expect from this product   although it was a good buy  it wasn t exactly a bargain as the price was not very far from what i could get on a  brick and mortar  store  as of know it has been what expected  reliable  and comfortable in hand  i  my mom  would recommend this product  the hairdryer fits exactly on the wall mount that we installed for our sears hair dryer   this hair dryer has more watts  so more power   my hair gets dryer much quicker   a very good product and can t beat the price   i was searching this product and this price was the cheapest  this is my second 209r   when my first one finally expired after around five years of daily use  i knew that i wanted another just like it     this dryer is wondefully efficient  lightweight and has the cord keeper feature that makes it very easy to store     very highly recommended  i like the design of the jerdon wall mount hair dryer  it s compact and easy to install on the wall  the double buttons make it easy to use  too  the cons  the dryer doesn t have a cool setting  only high  med  and low  plus the electrical cord is very short and you must install it very close to the outlet  good product  very easy to install  don t use the screw provided instead by special drywall screws otherwise we are very happy with this product  good price   it doesn t get too hot to damage your hair   super fast drying capacity    br   i didn t know changing the hair dryer makes your life this much easier  i tried this hair dryer at a hotel and loved the fact that it was lightweight yet powerful   i have problems with my arms and this allowed me to dry my hair without the added weight of those other hair dryers   i loved it so much  i bought 2  very powerful on high setting   needs a middle setting though   rocker switch very hard to move accurately from one setting to another  but maybe that will improve with use   shot of cool air feature is helpful and hair dries quickly with smooth finish   i rarely use my full sized chi dryer as the size  power and weight make this my go to dryer  that said  i haven t used this for international travel so cannot vouch for other features   overall a great value for the price  the dryer was exactly as advertised and i am extremely satisfied with the hair dryer  it was shipped without delay  out of the box  this dryer certainly comes with all of the essential requirements that i look for in a hair dryer   i won t buy a dryer without high med low heat and high low speed which this one has  because i do my hair both curly and straight   i like that it comes with a concentrator and diffuser  because it is sometimes hard to fit aftermarket attachments   the filter is easy to remove and clean it also isn t too heavy   the color is cute  although i don t know if most men would like it  br    br   on using it  it has good power  and it s not too noisy   it also doesn t get hot anywhere but on the very tip by the metal grate  and even that s not bad   if you are a stylist who likes to hold the barrel of the dryer  this is totally doable   and it s cool enough to put away immediately after use instead of leaving it to cool  which is especially nice   the cord is a good length  br    br   the retractable cord is definitely a nice feature  but should be done two handed  guiding the cord so it doesn t come up and hit your hand or arm  i tried it  ouch     it s a tad tricky because the button is small and slightly awkward to get to one handed  br    br   all that said  i have two issues with this product   the first is minor    there is no loop or hook to hang the thing up   i keep my dryer on a hook inside the door or my bathroom vanity cabinet  and it s an annoyance that i can t hang this there   and because the cord is retractable  you can t really loop it around the barrel and hang it with that without negating that feature  br    br   the second issue is more significant   i am no engineer  but in my lay opinion  this dryer has way too much vibration   it gives my hand a bit of a workout while holding it   i can t say whether this is a problem will this model  or just for some reason the one that i was sent   but it is significant  and it is still happening after 10 or so uses  br    br   this dryer is nice  but without understanding specifically the benefits of ionic  tourmaline etc   i don t see anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features i mentioned at the beginning   personally  i d rather have one with a hanging loop e anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features i mentioned at the beginning   personally  i d rather have one with a hanging loop  i ve been using this hair dryer for over 3 months now  i wanted to wait to give any reviews till i used this for awhile and i must say that it hasn t scored any points for length of use  i thought maybe if i continued to use it  my hair would improve from being dry  but it hasn t  br    br   this dryer has a low and high speed setting  and low  medium and hot heat settings  the low setting dryed my hair as fast as a cheaper dryer and the high speed setting is probably enough to even dry clothes rather quickly  it packs a punch  after using all three heat settings  i found that medium works best although hot doesn t get as hot as most other dryers i ve tried and those tend to actually burn the hair  there s also a cool shot feature that works great if you re using the hot setting and want an instant cool down  br    br   the attachments are an airflow diffuser and an airflow concentrator  both of these work well if you either want a wide spread airflow or a concentrated one  the concentrated one works good if you re using either a brush or curlers and want the air concentrated on that particular spot  the wide spread one is simply if you want a wider area of airflow  such as if you have really long hair  br    br   i thought that the tourmaline feature would make it somehow better for my hair  but i haven t noticed any improvement over other standard  and less expensive  hair dryers  this is my biggest dissapointment with this one and why i waited over 3 months to submit a review  br    br   on the plus side  the filter hasn t clogged yet or gotten any hair in it at all  this is amazing  since with other dryers i ve used  it didn t take long at all before hair would start gathering in the filter  this one also has a removable filter  but as of yet i haven t needed to clean it  br    br   this is also heavier than most dryers  so if you have weak arms or otherwise have trouble holding something rather heavy for the length of time that it would take to dry your hair  this one probably isn t for you  however  if you want to do something a little extra to help build muscle in your arms  this will do it  it weighs under a pound  but compared to other dryers  it weighs about 1 3 more on average  this is also quieter than most dryers i ve used  more time will tell on how durable it is  but the way this is constructed  i have no doubts that it will last a long time  br    br   i m giving this 3 stars due to the good features it has  but for the cost of the money and the seemingly better for your hair impressions that it seems it should have  it didn t score there  it remains just above average you  however  if you want to do something a little extra to help build muscle in your arms  this will do it  it weighs under a pound  but compared to other dryers  it weighs

  i m giving this 3 stars due to the good features it has  but for the cost of the money and the seemingly better for your hair impressions that it seems it should have  it didn t score there  it remains just above average  this model was installed by our contractor and served well for several years  until one day its innards flew apart  nobody was hurt     so we bought a replacement   the wall mount is very convenient   because we installed it low on a cabinet and the cord is a bit short  we hung it upside down  i e  cord on top   which requires the fifth  optional  screw through the hole in the magnet  otherwise it would slip right off the wall mount    power is adequate for me  i love this dryer  it is fast and relatively quiet  i have had great hair days ever since i bought this  since my hair dryers only seem to last a year or so  i am buying a couple extras as backup  i think this is the best hair dryer that i have ever owned  under no circumstances should a hair blowdryer have a heat setting hot enough to singe your hair off  i now have sections of hair that have been burned off  also  when i put my hair in a ponytail  i have hundreds of tiny short hairs sticking up because hairs were burned off  i also got 2 third degree burns on my skin      i purchased the featherweight first  took it back for the evolution  thought maybe with more settings it would be ok   that s when i noticed my hair has been singed off  with the featherweight  you have two heat choices  flame thrower or cold      the hottest setting on the evolution is the one that singed my hair off  the medium setting  isn t quite hot enough to get my hair straight  so  back this one is going too      for what it s worth  my sister raved about this dryer and she bought the evolution  and the featherweight  and the travel one  she is made of money though and i think unless something is outrageously expensive  she gets it in her head it is worthless  also  she always uses the diffuser and always does the curly look  probably on cool       i will be sticking with the elchim line  which i thought was outrageously expensive at  130 but now seems like a bargain  i m going for the da vinci model by elchim this time  all the best salons use elchim  it s funny that  130 seems like a deal for a blowdryer now      i purchased mine at sephora  so  this review is nothing against amazon  just want to get the word out there about this product  my wife already has this dryer  but she wanted another one to gift someone  the good thing i like about it is the dual voltage switch  compact  very simple to use  also it has the cool switch that blows cold air that my wife likes as well  overall simple to use and works good  the only con i can think of is the chord gets in the way a lot     by the way  the old one we had is still good  except there is some rust on the rim now so try to keep it away from any moisture     wow  i searched and searched for a good blow dryer and decided upon this one  it was the best decision  i am a professional so i have to have a sturdy blow dryer and this one is that and more  it dries the hair in about 3 4 minutes including long hair  with no frizz  i love it and would buy another one in a heartbeat  i picked up this dryer when i was staying some nights at my fiancee s apartment  so i could stash it out of his way when i wasn t there  it folds in half and the cord retracts into the handle  making it very small  i was immediately impressed with the power  i have pretty thick hair but i could completely dry it in just a few minutes  when we got married and bought a house it has stayed on with me  becoming my primary hair dryer  i have used it daily for about 3 years now and it has not faltered  definitely worth it  i bought this hairdryer to use while vacationing in europe   it worked great   it is true that you can only use the low setting in europe  however  it seemed as though the low setting was  putting out as much air as the high setting usually does here in the us   also  i only took a small carry on suitcase to europe   because of the fold down capability  this hairdryer fit perfectly into my carry on   i would highly recommend this product  love the hairdryer  it works amazing   my only problem that everyone should know is that i bought it for the 4 year warranty because i have had 2 chi hairdryers that broke just after my 1 year warranty expired   therefor this hairdryer was appealing to me   the only problem is bespoke labs wont honor my warranty because it was not purchased by an authorized beauty supply dealer   so i am screwed if this breaks early  overall  i like this hairdryer a lot   the thing that first drew me to this hairdryer   the color   it s a bright  shiny  fushia color   the make is very sleek and stylish   infiniti  by conair  is light and easy to handle  even when you re using a brush with your other hand   the best part of this hairdryer is  by far  the retractable cord  which makes it very easy to store   the filter is removable  making the life of your hairdryer longer  br    br   your hairdryer comes with a concentrator to help straighten your wavy or curly hair and a diffuser to give it body and life   it also is equipped with tourmaline ceramic technology which  according to the box  generates ions that work hair molecules to help dry them inside and out    ions smooth the cuticle layer    creating a silky  shiny look  br    br   i found the infiniti to be a very usable hairdryer   with heat options  hot    warm   and  cool   and power levels  high  and  low   there are plenty of way to dry and style your hair    hot  never got too hot and  warm  was perfect for my use   some hairdryers take a long time to cool down afterwards  but i am happy to report that the infiniti cooled off quite quickly   the retractable cord is also very handy   one quick word of warning about the cord  it retracts very fast   be careful of fingers or retract it little by little and not all at once  br    br   from my experience  my hair did look straighter and more silky than usual  which might be due to the  tourmaline ceramic technology    as mentioned before  i really do like this hairdryer  i can t locate the serial number for this anywhere  so i have to wonder where these came from  on the other hand  they are very light  quiet  and dry my hair more quickly than my  20 dryer did  i have medium texture curly wavy blonde hair  and it makes my hair shinier than i m used to with just the blow dry  but not really any less frizzy  however  the dryer is very hot which seems to make using my flat iron take longer since the hair seems to have already been heat styled into a specific position  pouf  with the dryer   my old dryer didn t provide such an effect  interesting tradeoff  but i would keep the t3 over my old one  love hairdryer  my hair is in great shape since switching to it  the only thing that i wish it had was a hot warm setting in addition to the high low we had these in our old home and left them so as not to disturb the wallpaper   we were so happy to find them again and they discounted  10 for buying two  that s so great  it is awesome not to have to look for your hairdryer and put it away each time  i love the blowdryer  the only thing is the color was not what you see in the picture  it was a shade of a greenish gold color  other than that it s great  it does not heat as well as i think it should  barely adequate and would not purchase again  i used the infiniti by conair 223f blow dryer on my 10 year olds hair  she has a head full of long blond hair but it is fine  usually when i use a blow dryer on her hair it gets to be fly away and static filled  this blow dryer worked great on her hair  it left it looking smooth and with a nice shine  she didn t get the fly away messy look from it  i started out using the hot setting and then moved down to the warm setting as her hair was drying  she liked that i was able to use the cooler setting especially when blowing it on her face to dry her bangs  i love that the cord retracts back into the handle for storing  makes it much easier to put away when done using it and also makes it nice while using it that you don t have to have a long cord dangling in your way  i don t mind the color  it actually looks more of a reddish purple to me than pink  the dryer is a little bulky for smaller hands  my daughter thought it was a bit heavy for her smaller hands but i had no problem hanging on to it and using it  overall  a nice blow dryer that works well  this hair dryer does wonders on naturally wavy  thick hair   it does reduce frizz and makes it very soft and smooth   the three heat settings are amazing too     and i can t even say how much i love the retractable cord feature    no more trying to make my cord wrap around my dryer to keep it out of the way   great product  this dryer is good because it s easy to use  but  i have a couple of hang ups about it though   1  it doesn t have a timer   2  the holes aren t well distributed for even heat penetration  overall  it s a decent hair dryer  i use it to deep condition  i love that my hair dryer is no longer cluttering up my sink area   the cavity behind the wallmount is spacious and allows me the hide the extra power cord that i do not need   i really like the night light too   the 1600 watts may be a ittle underpowered for some but it is fine for me  this was a great deal this is very light weight does get a little bit too hot for me  only has a high and low not a heat option    definetly drys my hair in record time  has a great long cord  great dryer for the price first  let me start by saying  i use my blow dryer lightly compared to others  so i can t comment on the longevity of this dryer  i am convinced there is no perfect hair dryer out there  but this particular one does a great job  br    br   i really like how quiet this is compared to some other models i ve owned  even on high  the noise is dramatically muted  if you shower during your childs naptime as i do  then this is huge    while i initially thought the retractable cord would be a plus  it makes storing the entire unit very cumbersome  i keep my dryer in a drawer in my bathroom  my old dryer had to have the cord wrapped around it a million times  but overall  it was pretty compact  not so with this model  the end of the plug cord is thicker  and difficult to bend  and the nose of the dryer is a bit longer then i m used to  not the end of the world though  br    br   i tried the diffuser one day  but found it to be a huge pain to work with  so i just set it aside   i ve gone this long without ever using one  i m sure i ll be fine without it  i always keep the concentrator on though  which only adds to the size of the dryer come storage time   it s great for quick  high temp drying  or for bangs  overall  i d recommend this  it s a good dryer that gets the job done  even though storing it can be kinda awkward   can t believe i was able to get it for such a great price   this is my 2nd t3 dryer   this one is so much lighter   love it   i had recently been on vacation  and the hotel had this hair dryer in their bathrooms   i liked it so much i decided i wanted one for my bathroom  found it  and purchased it   i have no regrets  br    br   first of all i love the convenience of having it mounted within easy reach   i am always running late  so being able to grab and dry is wonderful   it is a powerful little dryer and dries my hair quickly  br    br   i know others complain about the nightlight    in the beginning it seemed bright so i would simply pull the bathroom door to   now i don t even notice it  br    br   if you re looking for something efficient  practical and convenient  this is the little dryer for you  we bought one which lasted 3 1 2 years of fairly tough use from various family members   loved the wall mount design  as well as the light weight of the dryer   if you have children or seniors who have difficulty holding heavy dryers for any length of time   this is one of the lightest weight units we found  for the price   we paid about  14 00 for it at the time   so averages out to about  3  per year  we were very pleased with the longevity and the features of the unit  and are buying a new one as a replacement    asin b0008ent8i jerdon 1600w wall mount hair dryer   mounting was very easy  the hairdryer looks sleek   modern  works efficiently  i m very happy with it  i tried this in a recent hotel stay and had to order one for myself at home   the dryer has a retractable cord which is nice and it drys your hair quickly and without frizz  this is light weight  inexpensive  and was a great improvement from the travel hairdryer that finally broke after 10 years of use   i could definitely feel the soft and smoothing effects of the tourmaline   in fact i loved it so much that i bought another one when i was able to find it at target for  13   plus it s soft material does not scrap your walls or furniture when they rub against each other     highly recommend it  i purchased this hair dryer to replace one my daughter borrowed from me   i thought this was the same item   but was sadly mistaken  my original blow dryer was also conair ion shine 1875 watts  but it is a much better product  this one feels very plasticy and cheap  it does not have the power you would expect for 1875 watts either  br    br   all that being said for the cost of the dryer it works and i will keep it  but next time i will spend a few extra dollars for a higher quality hair dryer  great product i ve had this dryer for about 8 months and use it almost every day  i absolutely love it  i too found it difficult to get my shoulder length hair dry in a reasonable amount of time  i found the trick is to dry my hair with a blow dryer till just damp  roll it in my velcro rollers  then use the bonnet dryer while putting on my make up  about 10 minutes   i put the hose away while it s still warm so it scrunches up easily and fits back in the unit  i wait just a minute or two til my hair cools then pull the rollers out and style  hold nice volume all day long  i ve never had it overheat or turn off on me  knock on wood   i ll by another one when this one dies  the day i started using this hairdryer  i got compliments on how good my hair looked   no joke   people asked me if i d gotten a haircut and i had to tell them no  just a new hairdryer   it s a powerful machine for how small and compact it is   it folds up nicely to fit easily in a gym bag  suitcase or small bathroom drawer   the cord doesn t retract  which is good in my opinion   my last hairdryer almost started a fire when the retracting cord frayed and sparked   i ll update if anything goes wrong with this dryer  but i ve been using for about 2 months now with no problems   highly recommend it for the price  value and functionality  i suppose some people are never satisfied  i read all of the reviews and was amazed at the detail some wrote  for the price and good quality of this hair dryer i continually am amazed at some of the comments  it drys hair better  it doesn t  it s heavy  it s light wtf  the dryer works as well as any my family have had in the last 30 years  it drys hair  that s it  if you want to spend hundreds well  be my guest  as usual  fast delivery  good price and free shipping in certain cases and always a pleasure to shop on amazon  buy it  you ll like it  or don t    dang  the hair drier is as it was described  the price was really good and my daughter and her long hair are very pleased with the drier  br    br   the united states parcel post took 22 days to deliver it   it would be worth spending an extra bit of change to get a faster delivery  taking into account that this is a travel hair dryer  i have no complaints  it s been used for 5 to 10 minutes every other day for the past couple months and so far not a problem at all  there is only one tiny design complaint i have  and that is i figured the retractable cord would be completely hidden when fully retracted but theres a stopper which allows a good 10 inches of chord to remain   i wouldve preferred it to retract completely to the plug  but fine  i expected something different and this is what i got  so four and a half stars  otherwise  so far a great product for the unbeatable price  for its size it dries fairly quickly  and does indeed fold up into a nice little package  however you ll end up winding the rest of the chord around it anyway   and the folding handle makes a fair amount of cracking noise when you fold it   not the smoothest mechanism  but fine  once again  not perfect  but for size it s as good as it gets  br   update  it s now been a good 12 months or so  and the usage has gone up to 5 10 minutes almost every day  it s fallen off the counter 3 to 4 times  and still works like a charm  the other day  now about 6 months ago  however  the button to retract the cord flew off  with spring  while the cord was furiously being pulled out  i tried to reattach but it lost its retracting mechanism  fine  now it s a regular drier  although i do have to admit it s definitely very powerful for its size  quite amazing actually  still works like a charm  update 10 5 2011  this dryer went pop  began to breathe fire and emit noxious fumes  to say it died is incorrect  i turned it off    permanently  it had a lifespan of three years and five months  is this acceptable for a hair dryer that costs about  150 00  not as far as i am concerned  my next investment in hair dryer futures    asin b002jsl6qi babyliss babtt5585 tt tourmaline 3000 hair dryer    br    br   original review  the hair dryer like the toaster oven  the cell phone  and the corded telephone all are built with obsolescence in mind  br    br   my mother owned a chrome oster hair dryer that lasted for 26 years  sure it weighed

dryers is limited to a few models  my daughter was getting scared of the hair dryer so we tried this one and she loves   in addition it s probably the best hair dryer we ve owned in recent memory and my wife wants one too now  this hairdryer is great  it is light weight compare to my old hairdryer  it makes my hair look less coarse and softer  my old hair dryer made my hair looked very dry and more coarse  i just love it  this is one of the best hair dryers i ve ever had    i recommend it 100   and it s worth every penny    i am returning this hairdryer    that is  if they ll let me  i still haven t received a reply to my request and it s been a week  i tried it once and found it had a high pitched loud whine which my other quiet hairdryer fortunately did not have  sassoon  discontinued   also  the cords were too short and the light is way too bright  years ago i got a remington hair dryer similar to this one and through the years and many moves it got lost   i had been looking for one a long time and i found it at amazon com   i am very pleased with this item   i would recommend the product and your service to anyone  this is a wonderful hair dryer   so great to be out of the way on the counter     would have given 5 stars  but it was somewhat difficult to install   the screws supplied were too small and the unit wobbled on the wall   we purchased new  longer screws and fixed the issue      it is in our quest bedroom and i m sure will be a wonderful welcome to out of town quests   just like a hotel   its light weight and i love the new technology   it s very good for colored treated hair  i purchased this hair dryer on 18 june 2008  used it only three to four times per week and thought it worked very well   my hair dried quickly and was left soft and smooth   then only 21 days after the one year warranty expired it quit   no warning  no apparent problems  nothing to lead me to believe it wouldn t last a long time   it just stopped working and would not start again   the dryer still looks new  no scratches  no lint in the air intake screen  no kinks in the cord  but is doesn t work   before it quit  i would have given it four stars  deducting one for being rather loud   the fact that it lasted barely more than one year makes me want to give it zero stars   i ll compromise and offer two stars and wish you good luck if you decide to purchase this hair dryer  this blow dryer has only two settings  high and low with a cold shot  the high setting is very very hot  i m assuming that is why it dries hair so quickly  don t hold it in the same place for too long  you could burn your scalp  i do like the light weight of this dryer and long cord   i would like to have a dryer that you can have more control over the heat and output of air  i most likely will not spend 100 00 to replace this dryer with the same model  amazingly quick drying for such a small appliance   takes up such little space   i love  love  love this hair dryer  i wish i had read further down the reviews before i bought this myself  i read the first few reviews at the time   everyone seemed to love it  indeed  i loved it when i first got it  so much so that i bought a second one to have should this one burn out  that happened to me once on vacation      over time  i noticed my hair was becoming brittle and coarse and was thinning out   i attributed it to a new medication i was taking   my curly hair actually turned straight because of this medication and now i assumed my hair was continuing to morph into brittleness and falling out due to the meds  i also noticed that whenever my hair dresser cuts   blows out my hair  i have soft normal hair   i thought it was her hair products that gave that result   while ordering this as a gift for someone recently  i noticed the many negative reviews which described exactly what had happened to my hair too  i bought a new different brand of hair dryer and my hair has now been restored to normal  soft shiny hair just like when my hair dresser does it   while mine has never burned out or sparked  it does shoot out smoke now and then  but not often   stay away from this blow dryer   it will ruin your hair  this little wall hair dryer does the job  it s up out of the way  yet easy to grab and go to drying   it s just a great idea for all home beautification   i have very thick hair and i m done in around 5 7 minutes   a great gift for the friend getting married or for the graduate   i was looking for a wall mount hair dryer and came up with the andis read the reviews and decided that this dryer was for me in the 2nd bathroom so the night light helps and is not in anyway visable until you get into the hallway  great hair dryer would highly recomend this one            i have always felt that conair makes the best dryers   it is quiet and drys your hair quickly   nice black color   lightweight  we used a hairdryer like this in a hotel   it was so powerful that we came home and ordered one   we love it   it cuts the drying time in half   it folds for traveling and has a retractable cord   we love it  i was impressed the first time i used this hairdryer  it cut my drying time in at least half  and it was alot smoother  i used another brand for years   and i replaced them every few months   never held up   i have limited space in the bathroom and love the retractable cord and folding handle styles for that reason   i discovered this andis brand version at a hotel  five star  and searched it out and found it at amazon   i m very happy with it     it has already outlasted the conair versions   only reason i didn t give it five stars is for a ceramic ionic dryer   it leaves hair quite frizzy   if you need the compactedness of this dryer    it s the best one around  you will notice the quality of this product as soon as its out of the package   the plastic is thick and has some give to it  not like that cheap stuff that is hard and brittle   the motor is very tolerable   i would say it is quieter than most i ve used   i like the three speeds as well as the three temps   that is so much better than just having one temp and a slower speed   it still has a cold shot to freeze your hair when you ve got it where you want it   great product  this is the second conair 204p hair dryer that i ve owned  and it is truly the best hair dryer i ve seen   it is small  yet powerful   in addition  it is quiet   i am so glad to have found it  as it came out in stores a number of years ago   i feel especially pleased that a portion of my purchase goes to breast cancer awareness   thank you  amazon  i purchased this hairdrier after reading the reviews from consumer reports   rated in the top 2   i tried to find locally  but couldn t find any from this manufacturer   but was tired of noisy  heavy hairdriers   this one works great  has multiple temperature settings and is quiet and light   with an extra long cord to boot   it is also very attractively styled   no regrets  i bought this hair dryer to replace an old conair 1875 watt one   the old one was at least 12yrs  old and was still working  but making strange noises so i decided to look for its replacement before it died at an inopportune time   this dryer is great   it has a lot more  wind  power than the old one did but it does not seem to get as hot  which with the power is not an issue   it does not burn my head if i stay in one place too long as the old one did   the case is easy to hold  the dual controls are different  but better than the one it replaced   i would recommend this hair dryer without any negative issues   i did not want to spend a lot of money for an ion dryer and this one is perfect   it leaves my hair much softer and manageable and does a good job of drying hair fast   the amazon statement did not mention  ion    but on the box it states it is an  ion  dryer  replacement for the first one  which had the fan blade fly apart during use   cheap plastic fan blade where metal would be much better   it was out of warranty  and because i took the case apart to check for the problem  they would neither fix it or sell me the part to repair it   since i now have one for parts other than the fan  and the hair dryer fit so well where i had it hung  i went ahead and bought another one   it is a good design  but the quality could be better when it comes to that fan   no problem with anything else  just that cheap plastic fan blade  in my case anyway  my yellowbird has finally passed  after about 5 years of blowing out the hair of my family and friends  i am an african american female  and this blowdryer has straightened out some of the toughest hair imaginable  i braid the hair of my family and friends  and this dryer has been well used on a weekly basis since i took it out of the package  i used it up until it died on me today    i am soooo glad that amazon sells it  b c i am about to purchase a new one right now  i bought 5 of these  with nightlight  to put in each bathroom of my home   i find the light is a useful addition and can be turned off by clicking the test button on the power cord   the dryer is powerful  not extremely noisy  and appears to be of good quality contruction  the remington d 2012 is a solid  reliable hair dryer   the controls are easy to access and use   the hot is really hot and the cool is really cool   there is a noticeable difference between the heat levels and between the intensity levels   it s a good size  and not too heavy   it s easy to clean   the attachments fit well  br    br   my only quibbles are that the finish shows every single fingerprint  and there are plenty after you ve added your mousse or styling gel   and i would love a retractable cord   try as i might  i can never wind up the cord into a tidy compact mass  well worth the money   we always bought inexpensive hair dryers  but now can see the difference a professional model can make   would buy again  i bought this to replace a similar andis dryer that i bought 2 years ago that konked out   this one looked similar  but was much louder   the old one was billed as being quiet  this one was not  a quiet hairdryer is the most important quality for me  so now i am off to find one    i love this blow dryer  several years ago my old professional blow dryer died  and i ended up replacing it with the best that walmart could provide  it seemed to have all the latest and greatest technology and bells and whistles  3 heat settings  cool button  3 air speeds with ion  ceramic heat   but my hair just wasn t getting dry  by the time my hair dried my scalp was soaked  and my hair was was still frizzy no matter how much anti frizz hair product i used  i have what a hair professional termed textured hair  it s thick  porous  dries slowly because it retains moisture  and tends to frizz      this blow dryer dries my hair fast  straight  and my hair feels great  it takes half the time to actually get my hair dry now  and my scalp isn t soaked afterwards  this blow dryer gives me the same results as my salon visits  big revelation    not all blow dryers are alike     this blow dryer is an investment  but thanks to the great reviews i was confident in giving it a try  and i m so glad i did  it s worth every penny in time savings  and i like my hair again  and i actually have a hair style  hair dyer works great for it s size  it doesnt over heat like some customers say it does  works great for condisioning and dying hair  only drawback i see is it s hard getting everything back into the case easy to mount on the wall   that helps to free up counter space   it drys very well and isn t too noisey  however the over heating sensor in the hand held part is overly active   when drying my hair if i hold it close to my head it will shut off and you have to wait for it to cool down before it will let you reset it  first used this hair dryer in a hotel room  liked it so much  when i came home  i ordered two  one for me and one for my daughter   it is so powerful  it dries my hair very fast  more than twice as fast as my previous hair dryer   i ve been very pleased with this hairdryer  i read the reviews here before buying it    but don t find that it s heavy like some have stated   i love that it has a warm setting  not just hot and cold  over the years of working in salons  my own included  i have had many dryers  i like working with this as it is extremely light weight and dries the hair very fast and almost frizz free  excellant product for the professional stylist definitely a great dryer  nice and lightweight yet very powerful with various heat settings  most professional hair dryers are large and very heavy so your arm tires while drying your hair but this one is smaller and easier on the arm  would recommend  while only moderately useful for drying my short hair  i loaned this to my fiance to check it out and she said it was great  she used to have a very expensive hair dryer and said that this one worked just as well  of course  everyone s hair is different but the important thing is that the temperature is good and with the optional diffuser attachment  there are more options depending on your hair style  male or female  this is a great product at a good price and the quality seems very good at this price point as well  this remington hair dryer really is a terrific hair dryer  i ve been using it for about a month now and my hair has never looked better  it has three heat settings and two speeds  i use the lowest speed unless i m in a big hurry   i do the same with the heat settings because all of them are great for drying my hair   it is a heavy hair dryer  but that does not matter to me  i never dreamed it would work this well   after drying my hair and then using the flat iron  my hair is frizz free and shiny  i love it  works well   glad i bought it   the cord keeper is certainly a nice feature and the bright color makes it easy to find under my bathroom cabinet  we ve been using this hair dryer for a few weeks now on a constant basis   overall  this is a powerful blower that gets your hair dry quickly with excellent balance of heat   no hot spots that cheapo dryers can develop   yes  it is on the heavy and bulky side but that s because of the quality construction   i have no doubt this dryer will continue to last for years to come  when i got this hair dryer for my wife  she was impressed by the quality of the packaging and the hair dryer  once she used it  she was further impressed by its power and how fast it dried her hair   this hair dryer is amazingly quiet even with all of its power  unlike others that she has used in the past   it comes with various options such as three heat settings  a diffuser  and a cool shot button that provides a quick blow of air for a final styling touch    the only reason it gets four stars is because of its weight  i got this for my girl   some comments are mine  some are hers   it dries really quickly   this takes about half of the time that i am used to   it is surprising quiet for a hair dryer   you could easily use this without completely pissing off roommates if a few doors are closed   the best hair dryer i ve used  i have not used any of the attachments  so i may add that info when i find out   not much else to say other than i really like this   glad i have it  i would recommend this to a friend  to cut down the drying time  even when it s on cool my hair dries fast  i wish i would had gotten the ceramic one excellent product  compact and powerful with ion generator and cool green nightlight  led   nice design   built in ground fault protection and thoughtful cord hook  very easy to mount and fairly quiet in operation  especially on low speed  my wife  who doesn t speak   write english by the way  hense not writing this herself  especially likes the attachments and overall quality of this dryer  the three heat settings which provide just the right range  as well as the no heat   blow only setting  br    br   but she says the blower is far too strong and wonders why it doesn t provide a lower setting than hurricane strength   i can only guess that this is because if the heat setting is on high there has to be a minimum amount of fan strength to keep the unit from catching fire  br    br   i imagine that a professional hair stylist has the advantage of being able to hold the dryer some distance away from a customer s head and that s why it s so hot and blows so strong  but of course someone using it on themselves doesn t have that advantage  br    br   ceramic is nice  as well as the ion emissions  br    br   bottom line  despite complaining about the strength of the fan  she already tossed her old dryer and uses this one because it is a professional level item   i imagine she ll get used to the fan strength  i purchased this hair dryer and when i plugged it in for the first time  it knocked my outlet surge protector and also the circuit breaker for the bathroom  i had not even turned the hair dryer on  it had the hot  electric smell  i sent it back for a refund which amazon quickly honored  i will not try this brand again  this hair dryer was everything i wanted  retractable cord  folded for space concerns  relatively light weight  worked well enough for me  however  it broke today   but i ve had the thing for three years  i ve used it pretty sparingly  maybe drying my hair once a week  tops  except for two month long periods  in which i got a haircut that required more attention     i m going to buy a similar one  i think  i love the design   3 i m so  so sad that it s dead  this is my new favorite hair dryer   it has numerous settings so i can get the heat and air flow that i want for various sections of my hair   the balance is good and it is not too heavy  which tends to be a problem with other hair dryers with this excellent level of air flow volume  i wish it had a retractable cord  but that would add bulk that i would probably be unhappy with  i don t use a dryer often so this dryer works fine for me  i found it well balanced  not too heavy  not too loud  and it did dry my hair fast  the only thing i would have liked is a lower setting that doesn t blow quite so hard  i have very fine hair and even on low this dryer blows my hair all over the place  i m not sure i would love it if i needed to use a dryer on a daily basis but for the occasional quick dry user it is fine  another possible issue if you don t have very long arms you may find the nozzle too long with the directional attachment in place  it adds a lot of length to the end of the dryer bringing it too close to your hair which can do damage  it does have a cool setting which i did like  it takes longer to dry but it doesn t damage fine hair  i ve ordered lots of things on amazon before  but this is the first time i feel compelled to write a review  i just love this hair dryer  i bought it because i was tired of all the different cords on our bathroom counter  hair dryer  straightener  curler  husband s shaver charger  etc  so the retractable feature was what drew me to this product  but after using it  i ve found a bunch of added bonus  one of which is how fast it dries my hair  it literally takes only half the time than my previous drier  it s also pretty quiet  and the ceramic coil doesn t produce the burning smell like older hair driers do  overall i d say this is the one product that really impressed me        i bought this product too  to get it at a lower price  but honestly  its not worth it because it broke within 3 months  the serial number on the product was not legit  should be a silver label   so chances are the products shipped from amazon are not real t3 hairdryers  also considering the fact that amazon is not a licensed distributor  you should avoid buying it because the warranty is not covered by the manufacturer  if you want to invest in this hair dryer try to find it at a local beauty store  i found one with warranty and all for  170  and be sure to look for the silver serial number label  andis 30130 hangup 1600w wall mount hair dryer excellent value for the price   telephone style cord is great  i selected this dryer after reading other reviewers comments  as i was looking for one that did not make me feel like i was opting for dry hair over my hearing  i was replacing one that had many of the same features as this one  except it felt like it was piercing my eardrums to use it  this one is much better  as was promised  in fact  it really is the best blow dryer i ve ever had  the only reason i couldn t give it a 5 star rating is because of the button that retracts the cord  it was placed on the side of the dryer where it sticks out  so that when you put the dryer down in between blows  it pushes the button and startles me as it trys to retract  it should have been made so that the button recedes a bit so it isn t accidently pushed  but  all in all  it is great  i have learned to be more cautious as i lay it down and am happy with my purchase  i purchased this dryer because i have another conair model 1875 that i absolutely love   and i want an extra to keep at work   this one isn t quite as quiet or as quick at drying as my other model 1875  but nevertheless  it is much quicker and quieter than my old regular hair dryers   i would definitely recommend the product as a replacement to an older or non ionic model hair dryer  this product works very well with me especially i have short hair  the only weakness of this product is the hot air has a hard time to flow to the top of my hair i have to pull the bonnet up high on my head to the upper hair to dry  however  i cannot style my hair without this machine any more because this one works very well and save time  this feels and acts like a commercial grade hair dryer   the heat is sufficient and it dries my hair quickly   i have straight medium thick hair and it usually takes longer with my other hair dryer  so this is a huge plus   my daughter has very curly and extremely thick hair and wants to take this dryer from me   it works wonders on her hair and cuts her dry time in half     we are very pleased with the remington d 2012 dryer but if there were to be modifications in the future it would be to perhaps make it lighter and quieter   if you want fast  salon dry hair  this is a great purchase  i had read the review in in style and my prior conair hair dryer had died   it works great and i love the retractable cord  i have no complaints about this hairdryer   it is quieter than any other dryer i have used and dries my hair quickly on the medium heat setting   it comes with two attachments  one for curly and one for a more direct flow of air   it s light and is easy to hold and manipulate   highly recommended  this is a good hair dryer  it worked properly in europe  it is compact and light weight to carry  i would definitely recommend it  quick delivery  used dryer in great shape  the mrs  is hard to please when it comes to hair care products  another great product from conair and another safe and enjoyable transaction with the big a way to go amazon i love the way this dryer works   it s not so powerful that it blows the hair all over the place but it s ionic feature makes my hair feel so much thicker and i love the nightlight  too  1  i was very happy with the smaller size and lighter weight of this dryer  it doesn t get heavy while using  br   2  i really appreciate the easy reach of the temperature buttons  cool shot and on and off buttons  br   3  it also dries hair more quickly than other dryers  br   4  it has a nice look to it  br   5  lastly  this dryer is easy on the hair too it leaves hair feeling soft and looking glossy  br   i love it and recommend it highly  i bought this exact drier from walmart yesterday it was 50  off   and i couldnt wait to use and when i did i loved it   i can talk to my fiancee and still hear him while using it do to the reduced noise   the only thing is that it takes longer to dry hair than most dryers but so what plan ahead and make time for your hair     this wall mounted unit was easy to install  has plenty of power and eliminates all the bother of storage and cord untangling of a portable unit  the automatic shutoff feature works great  the unit has 2 speeds  however the high speed is normally used  we purchased this unit after seeing it previewed on a shopping channel and hearing how professional stylists in hollywood and elsewhere use it with great effectivness  our experience is the same  on the low heat setting the temperature is consistent and the unit is much quieter than any other brand we ve tried before  it has a nice long cord and comes with a supply of air filters  i have been able to eliminate hairspray as i style the hair with the dryer and a comb  there must be something special in the tourmaline technology and ions because my hair looks great  i recommend this product to anyone looking for a new hair dryer  it costs more than most dryers but the product quality  the quietness on the low setting  the long cord  the most important item  the way my hair looks makes the price worth it  i purchased this one after keeping an eye out for a compact wall mounted unit for our small guest bathroom   it fits in a tight space quite nicely   does all the things that a hair dryer is supposed to do   reasonably quiet and robust drying air flow   a good purchase at a very reasonable price   would recommend for anybody looking for this type hair dryer  br    br     asin b000x2ucjo jerdon first class wall mount hair dryer  1600 watts  2 speeds heat settings  white   great service  shipped and arrived on time  have used the product before and am satisfied with it  i am very pleased with this product   i like it even more than the others i have used in many hotels rooms  it s quiet but dries my hair really well  i like the nightlight but i unplug it during the day since it isn t sensitive to light dark  fantastic product  i feel like i m in a hotel when i shower  the price was incredible also  this little hair dryer is fantastic for the price   it s speedy and i love the fact it hangs up   the black is priced much less than the white   super bargain  i was expecting more power   in all fairness  my regular home use hairdryers are larger  very powerful and much more expensive models   i wanted something lighter and dual voltage   this did not work for me and i returned it immediately for a refund  this is a great product and the price half of what you would pay at a salon  the weight of this item isn t any different from the others i ve used  slightly heavier than my healthy infusions by wahl pro dryer it my opinion  seems nothing special  br    br   i don t like the long nozzle  perhaps if you have very long limbs  you wouldn t have as much trouble drying the top and top rear potions of your head  br    br   the wind output is pretty good  though  comparable to my healthy infusions by wahl pro dryer  it s about the same  br    br   no swivel cord  buttons feel a bit cheap  but i guess it s a hair dryer    nothing fancy here  br    br   no  it s not quiet  it s as noisy as my other dryers  br    br   it doesn t seem to remove frizzes any better than my other dryers either  br    br   all in all  nothing special here  just another dryer  i d not pay a premium for it  good  handy little hair dryer that i can keep in a drawer at the bathroom sink   i m a head shaver so i only needed this for my son  occasionally  and for guests   works great  this is the second andis hair dryer i have had  the first was a gift and i loved it  so when it broke after 8 months of 3xs a week use i didn t mind buying myself a new one  then this one lasted less than 4 months  just up and stopped working mid drying one day   thank goodness i had a back up  i tried calling and emailing the customer service for andis repeatedly and have been completely ignored  i used to recommend this brand to everyone because the drying capabilities are amazing and the product feels sturdy   but now i would steer clear  my last conair was only  35 too and lasted for 8 years  i would rather go with something reliable than andis  i bought this to replace one just like it   i have used it everyday for at least 5years  i love the way it is out of the way   and right at your finger tips  item was shipped quickly  however i was rather disappointed at the quality of the item  it didn t leave my hair as soft as i would have liked it to be  it left my hair big and frizzy  my hair feels so soft after i use this dryer  not dry and frizzy  i use it w the diffuser  i love it    my favorite blow dryer  dries your hair fast  on turbo setting  with minimal damage      note  for those with wavy hair  it tended to straighten out my curls a bit  but didn t get rid of frizz so much  this is the second time i have bought this dryer  my housekeeper accidently broke the little latch on the first one so it wouldn t atay hung up anymore  i had the first one for about 3 or 4 years   i loved it enough to repurchase rather than getting another brand or style  highly recommend this dryer for its convenience and quick hair drying  very well made   much quieter than most   it does not have quite the power as i am used to   mounts easily on the wall   i would definitely buy this again  this ion shine hair dryer is great  especially for my hair  which is very fine  the wattage is great for fine hair and it has high low and warm hot settings  it also has the cool shot button which i love  the ion technology is really nice  i have noticed that my hair is very soft after using it and my split ends are practically non existent  the buttons do take some getting used to but totally worth it   for the price  this has been a good hairdryer   i was considering much more expensive dryers when i saw reviews for this one   it has great heat control  very cool warm very hot   i accidentally change the setting with my fingers like other reviewers  but not a big deal   so far  i like it  i had this hair dryer for years until the surge protector button on the plug kept popping out  i bought a conair hair dryer at wal mart to replace it  got home  plugged it in  and couldn t believe how cheap and loud it sounded  i returned it immediately  and was happy to find that the remington was available from amazon com    i m completely sold on this hair dryer  the motor is quiet and drying time is short  the only problem is that it felt slightly heavy at first  but after using it a few times  i suppose i got used to it because now that s not an issue  works well for the money invested  simple  two speed rocker switch is adequate for most applications  holder is very secure  easy to take dryer out and to put back   cord hanger is a nice touch  especially if unit is mounted where the cord might dangle onto counter  into sink  etc  moderate noise level  typical for this size of device  this is a great hair dryer   i blow my curly hair straight and then flat iron it smooth   my old cheapo dryers would create a mushroom shaped pouf on my head  which  in turn  would take forever to flat iron out   this dryer makes my hair noticeably smoother  and much less freaky   and cuts my time with the flat iron in half   i did give it four stars instead of five because it is slightly on the heavy side  but not so heavy that i would return it   i would purchase it again   maybe it will help me work on the muscle tone in my arms    this dryer ruined my hair    at first  after i bought it  i really liked how quickly it dried my hair  after using it every day for about 8 days  i noticed a strange smell  but didn t know what it was   it didn t smell like burning hair  more like home perm solution   i switched from high heat  which had been fine with my conair  to the medium setting  and the smell went away  but the damage continued  i have medium length fine straight hair  and the ends became dry and frizzy and began to break off  after a month  my hair has turned to brittle straw  won t curl  and is breaking all over   also  i color my hair with semi permanent coloring  and the now frizzy ends absorb more of the coloring  giving a strange look  i realize now that this dryer was working so quickly because it was way too hot  even on the medium setting  not sure if the ions were a factor  but it doesn t matter  after reading the other reviews here  i feel lucky not to have experienced sparks or flames  i m getting a short cut and a new dryer and waiting for my hair to grow out  i m extremely upset  and definitely will not purchase another revlon product  this is a nice professional hair dryer  so far its working nicely  the only issue is the overweight  but it compensates with faster hair drying even half the time than used to be with other brands   me and my wife would recommend this if you want a faster hair dryer and stronger arm muscles    this dryer is attractive  appears well made  and is fairly small  it would be a good dryer for those limited in space and for travel   pros  heat and speed options  moderately quiet motor   con  no cool shot button   if you like this style of dryer  this is a good choice  this remington d 2009 t studio dryer may be the best value on the market for this type of dryer    pros  low pitched  quiet motor  not too heavy  variety of heat and speed settings  very well made  dries with relatively low heat   cons  high setting so powerful i couldn t use it to style my hair  and although my hair was very straight and sleek using this dryer  i felt it dried out the ends   neutral  i prefer a wider barrel opening  this one is quite narrow   if you want a powerful  quiet  well made dryer  this is it   if you want a gentler dryer  this isn t it  love  love  love this hairdryer   it delivers what it promises and the fact that you push a button and the cord retracts inside the handle is a definite plus for neat storage  my teenaged daughter kept borrowing my blow dryer until i finally purchased another  of the same  for her   i love how quiet this blow dryer is and how quickly it dries my hair  my daughter has long  thick hair and it dries hers quickly as well   it is light in weight and the airflow is controlled  i use mine daily and have not have any problems in the 18 months since i purchased it  my purchase arrived just a couple of days later   i had expected longer delivery time   the t3 was priced much lower than other web sites   it is light weight and has a little bling on the handle     dried quickly and i am thrilled to get the lower price for the exact same product listed elsewhere   thanks for quality products at lower price and excellent delivery   who says a grandma can t be cool with a new blinged out t3  i researched hair dryers prior to making my purchase because this is something i rely on very seriously and need it to work and do a good job   i was replacing a very cheap and extremely annoying hair dryer i have had as a back up   i have not been disappointed   it has a nice feel  is not annoyingly noisy and does a great job   i recommend this to anyone looking for a quality dryer  lost the low heat setting in the first couple months   it caught on fire before it was a year old   wouldn t recommend my wife seems to like the dryer and her looks great   she says its faster her only comment is that there is no high warm only a high hot     its a great product for a good price hopefully it will last the test of time   according to the other reviews  you can t return it to the manufacturer when purchased on amazon     so far so good   i ve had two hair dryers in the last 27 years so when i had to buy another this weekend i wondered what all of the ion technology stuff was all about   well   i m not sure i love it  my hair is long and fine and i had to use three times the amount of root lifter to get my hair to do anything  pretty much it s just plastered to my head      the other thing i did not like was that the buttons are right where my fingers go so i kept hitting them and changing the settings as i was drying     a plus is that even though my other dryer was 1875 watts this dryer seems much more forceful and it dried my hair over all very quickly without getting super hot  i m sure the dryer is much better for my hair than my old dryer  but i just can t take this limp hair     i ll update in a few days  maybe it was just a bad weather day     i owned this hairdryer for about 6 months  i must have gotten a dud because it never seemed really powerful  got waaaay too hot  and broke after 6 months  my hair didn t look any different with this dryer than with my old conair cheapie that i got from cvs  we ve owned three of this model hair dryer now   the first one lasted five years and the second lasted 4 1 2 years   that s roughly  6 year which allows me to justify replacing the unit with the same model    that and the fact that the mount is already on the wall   of course  we still have our backup hair dryer which is a gillette pro max that i received 30  years ago when i was sixteen    that one is still going strong  i first discovered this little gem of a hairdryer at our condo  while on vacation near orlando  i was so impressed  i ordered one when i got home and use it as a spare when i go to the gym  there s a lot of power in this little dryer  two speeds   high and low  i prefer high and my hair  which is fairly long and thick  dries very quickly and seems to wave extra nicely with this dryer  i love it  thought it was a little heavy when i first used it  i got used to using it and i don t think that now  it s very easy to use  has 3 different heat settings  has a low and a high speed  the cord keeper feature is great  saves a lot of space  i d recommend this hair dryer  i thought i could never replace my baby bliss professional  however  this product has taken the lead  my wife got to try this product out at a friend s house and feel in love with it after 1 use  the price seemed a little steep but after the purchase it was well worth it  it takes her a fraction of the time to blow dry her hair  this thing gets hot fast without heating up the bathroom too much  the massive output of heat really dries her hair quickly and keeps her from being in a hot room and getting sweaty just to dry her hair like the last hair dryer did  i ve never seen or heard of a better hair dryer  a definite buy    colors may vary it seems there is either red on black  or black on black  has everithing i was waiting for  it s a valuable item  sincerely i am very happy with this product my old conair died so i read all the reviews and decided on this hairdryer   very satisfied   the weight is good  the attachments are fine  and the price was right   you don t need anything better   i really like the ability to open the cover to get to the mesh filter to clean it and the 3 heat settings and 3 blower settings  a winner  if i have this right  this is an older  closeout version of the current  300 evolution hairdryer but for the price it s a great deal   it is not the identical model to the current one  as it only has 1600 watts vs  2000 watts for the current one   but  look at it this way  you could buy 3 of these for the same price as the one from an authorized dealer with a warranty and you would still have to pay  15  to have it fixed if it breaks under the warranty   the one we got came with no serial number as described in other reviews below  but it has been working extremely well and as advertised in that it dries hair significantly faster than our old conair yellowbird 2000 watt and leaves your hair feeling much softer   i d rather pay  100 with no warranty than  300 with one  that s like spending  200 on an extended warranty   we wanted something that our children could use since we have very limited counter space in the bathroom   so far  it s been just what we needed   and  it is much more quiet than hotel wall mounts we have used  for its price  it is a good deal  dries hair nicely and quickly  the ion feature works   it makes the hair shinier and less frizzy  overall a good investment to manage your hair  this hair dryer works great   i did have a problem with the shipping though   it got lost in the mail and then arrived damaged   the new one is quiet and dries my hair quicker than my old one   my hair stylist says that this brand of hair dryers tend to take a while to warm up but i have not noticed this so far  i love this dryer   it dries your hair faster as it claims and is light weight for holding   so far so good  works great   easy to use   not too noisy   ample air flow   ionic is a recent buzzboard that proposes this technology reduces frizzies   i don t see a difference compared to old school hair dryer  i ve been using an andis prostyle 1600 hair dryer for 10 or more years   for me it is perfect   the most important feature for me is that i can drop the heat 1 setting and still keep the fan on high   it is light weight  blows lots of air  and is inexpensive   mine is still going strong  but i m buying a backup to replace it for when it dies  as all hairdryers eventually do  my wife loves this blow dryer so much that she wanted me to buy one for our daughter too  excellent price for excellent product  my sister had a hair dryer just like this one and it broke  she had purchased it at target but it was no longer available  i found it on amazon and bought it for her  it was just what she was looking for  i did enjoy the hair dryer very much when it worked  i have very curly hair and it used to dry my hair very fast with a nice shine and no frizz i used it for maybe 10 times in a yr and it stopped working  it only blows cold air  i have had a conair hair dryer that i bought for  25 00 5 yrs ago and it still works  bought the hairdryer for my wife  she was very happy with the performance   when i went to register the product i couldn t because the sticker on the box that has the serial   was missing  i then found out through amazon that they are not a authorized reseller therefore company won t honor warranty if something happens  i bought this for my wife who liked it  until it stopped working 2 monthes after we got it   we ll see how well they honor the warranty   it was a little heavier than her past cheap versions  but dried faster and i liked that it was much quiter  i bought it because of the good reviews and it s quietness  it s not as powerful as the others i ve had  but it does dry my hair quicker with less frizz  i m happy with it and so are my kids because it s quieter than my previous one  i have been using wall mounted hair dryers in hotels for years and always threatened to purchase one   when i found this one i was pleased with the price  the wattage and the apparent look of it  when it arrived   i was very pleased with how easy it was to mount on the wall in my rather small bathroom   i don t need a hair dryer for styling  just simple use each morning   seems to be working just fine and meets my needs  this dryer works great  it provides a nice heat and it even has a lint collector that can be taken off to clean i have one of these hair dryers in each bathroom   they are easy to install  work well  and the night light is nice and bright  but not obnoxious    my wife likes the power of this small dryer  but if you ask me they seem a bit on the loud side   i think it is because of the very compact design   not enough plastic material to absorb the fan noise  i liked this dryer at first  but within six months it stopped working   it had a burning smell inside   dead   i don t know about you  but i feel like a blow dryer should last longer than that   and  who likes getting stuck without one   excellent product   reasonably quiet  size is good and price is super for a product of this quality this is a simple and effective dryer for those who are space conscious and don t want any frills   the low setting is only useful for people with short hair as it is little more than a breeze  which works pretty well for my hair    the high setting is powerful and would dry anything but a wookie in a fairly short time   great for travel as it is light and compact   it does make a good bit of noise on high     not perfect  but definitely worth the price  i have had four of these wall mounted hair dryers and love them  they are up and out of the way and stay pretty much un noticable  no fiddling with on off buttons and looking for a place to store it   if one leaves the on switch on and hangs it up  it goes off and returns to the blowing setting as soon as one lifts it again  this is great  on a scale of 1 10 this item scores 11  it works well   blows a lot of air and it is not too hot  it does sometimes pull my hair into it and then it emits a burning smell   i like how light it is to hold as well   i would recommend it  with the exception of the hose being a little short   this is a great little hair dryer that has 4 temps   it is light weight   easy to store and easy to travel with   i recommend it    i love the dryer  although the color is all black  not silver   either way  it gives a silky smooth blow dry  i really like the hair dyer it is light  drys hair in half the time but i had no idea that amazon was not an authorized dealer  if you don t mind taking the chance paying  100 with no warranty it s a great dryer i think it is deceptive of amazon to sell this product as new  and not let people know what they are getting into  marianne this dryer exceeds expectations   dries hair fast  is quiet and light weight  big plus  and no frizzies   in fact  sometimes it makes my hair too silky so i have to use more harsh shampoo or only a teenie weenie bit of conditioner  i purchased this for my sister  who has long  naturally curly and somewhat frizzy hair   she also has cerebral palsy so needed a dryer that was lightweight   this one fit the bill  she loved it on the first use   her hair was smooth   shiny and the dryer works great   a great value  the concept was good   i like the idea of hands free drying   but    the engineering was bad   dispite the large suction cup it still fell off of my mirror   so i stuck it to the sink   it fell over and the dryer hit the 6 foot mirror over my sink   thought it was a gonner but turned out ok   i still stick it on the sink but position it so that if it falls it will not damage anything in its path   maybe if i could attach it permanently to the wall    some reviewers thought this dryer was heavy  i found it to be lightweight but powerful   i use the diffuser and was hoping to purchase an old fashioned one that didn t have fingers  however  this diffuser works better than some others  with fingers  i ve used   it left my curly hair curly without frizz like some older hair dryers   the only drawback i can see is it s quite large so when traveling i will have to resort to my old fold up one  it is very handy  does a good job drying my hair  i liked it so well i bought a second one for the other bathroom  this is by far the best blow dryer i have ever owned   i used to swear by the chi but this one is not even comparable   very happy with it  it dries my hair  and i have noticed a lot less frizzies and fly aways since i started using it  the cord is on the short side  i d say maybe 4 5 feet long when stretched  the color is pretty much exactly as it looks in the picture  definetly pink  the cool air function is very nice to have  it s light weight and fits in my hand very comfortably  it s not too loud  all in all  does what it is supposed to do in a quick and comfortable fashion  i definetly recommend this to anyone willing to dry their hair within a few feet of the outlet they plug it into  i m really happy with this product  my hair is much smoother and feels healthier  i would definitely recommend this item  but couldn t imagine paying full price for it  a  300 hairdryer would have to come with it s own stylist to be worth it  if you enjoy the convenience of a wall mounted air dryer when you travel    why not have the same at home   this mounted unit keeps my sink area uncluttered  it is attractive   works well and out of the way  wouldn t pay full retail for it  because i personally can not afford to pay full retail but i believe it s safe to say that this is absolutly one of the best if not the best hairdryer out there  very pretty with the jewel studded handle  powerful light quiet and pretty much does everything it claims to do  i can easily see how this can be a favorite of the worlds top stylists  at the price i got it for on amazon website i am very pleased  you won t be dissappointed with it  i am getting the funny smell on high as others have described   in addition to the high heat setting possibly being too much for the hardware to handle  it s also hotter than i can handle     the fan speed and temperature are linked  as there is only one switch   the low speed is too low  but you have to use high heat to use the higher speed  have not bought a new hair dryer in years and was quite happy with this purchase  this dryer was very cheap but not cheap made  it works alot better then i expected very good buy  i would recommend  i was excited to get this hairdryer as we have no space in our tiny bathroom to store a bigger hairdryer   i ve used wall mounted hairdryers in hotels and thought that it would be the solution for me     wrong   while it s great to have it up on the wall and out of the way  the small size makes it better suited to short hair   with longer hair you have to be careful to hold the dryer farther away from your head so that hair doesn t get sucked into the back of it   i believe this is what caused my hairdryer to start overheating after just two months of use   the fan became very sluggish and the coils would overheat  then it would spark and the thermostat would reset   the fan would speed up within a few minutes to where it could keep the coils from overheating  but eventually this took even longer   i took it apart to clean it but it is made in such a way that you can t get at the hair that is wrapped around the fan stem   i could see that it was only a few strands anyway  but even this was too much     even when it was new it didn t blow a lot of air  though it did get fairly hot   i m off to buy a full size hairdryer with more power and will just have to figure out a place to hang it   blah       p s   the nightlight is really  really bright   i disabled mine after a couple of nights of trying to ignore the green glow emanating from the bathroom  this andis 30970  was a wonderful purchase   good size  good heat temperature  easy to install and the cord hanger goes on either the right or left side   i have had other wall mounted dryers  they were hard to hang  the andis was up in a matter of minutes  being able to have a blow dryer at hand  rather than stuffed in some drawer or cabinet  makes the morning routine so much easier   one tip   to prevent overheating  do occasionally remove the screen from the back of the dryer   once the screen has been removed  built up lint can be accessed and cleaned easily  fast  lightweight and durable    this is the best hair dyer ever    not only does my hair dry in half the time it also looks shinny and healthy    i love this hairdryer  i bought this for my wife  wasn t sure because as seen on tv products are often very gimicky    but she loves it  a few women i ve told about the gift thought it was great too   it s bulky and heavy  but that s a good sign that it s built well and will last  the suction cup was large  but it has fallen down once  because of it s size and weight  attaching it and pulling it off the mirror every time you use it is not an option  but it s a little scary leaving it up all the time   tip  don t put anything expensive underneath it    better tip  thoroughly clean mirror and blo and go with alcohol before application      i wish this came with an option to attach securly to wall with screws  the image shows it attached to a wall or a door  but i highly doubt it could do that    needs a completely clean flat surface like glass     other than that  i am satisfied  she asked for a colorful hairdryer to take back to texas a and m  this one has a beautiful glittery finish  while also being a very good one  she rally did like it  it looks good  light in weight  very powerful  makes my hair shine   these new tourmaline ceramic dryers are not always what they advertise to be  but this dryer is everything it says it is and more   it cost a little more  but it is worth every penny  very nice dryer  larger sized travel  nice power   doesn t frizz my hair like my old dryer did  happier with a full sized travel than the compact ones    dries hair faster   without the frizz  overall a good product   has a powerful motor in a very compact form   no problems installing holder and have had no problems with unit   there are only 2 settings  1 low and no heat  and 1 high with heat   however  my wife says the heat setting is not that warm so factor that in   if you want real heat  this may not be unit for you  i really love this blowdryer   it really does eliminate frizz   i m not sure if my hair really is healthier  but it definitely looks like it is  as a woman with long hair  i need a good hair dryer that is easy to move around my head  this one fills the bill  with a retractable cord it makes for eash storage  it also dries hair quickly and is easy to use with your styling brushes  this hair dryer works well  it s much quieter than most dryers i ve used  which is great  because i always worry about damaging my hearing with daily use  so it s great not having to have to worry about that     some people talk about how heavy it feels  but i don t really notice  i do visit the gym every once in while  so there you go     i thought the silvery front part of the dryer was going to be metal  but it s a dull plastic  that makes it look quite a bit cheaper than pictured  it still works great nonetheless  it dries faster than my other dryer  i really like all of the settings  warm hot  and cool button   low high  as far as the shininess   i didn t notice a difference  but i definitely had less static and fly aways      it comes with a diffuser and another part which you can snap on  which i m pretty sure is for blowing your hair out       all in all  this hair dryer is a good deal for the price  i think it s cheaper here on amazon than walmart  at my wally  there were selling it for  20 and i got it for  10 here  on a recent trip one of our hotels had this dryer in the room and my wife liked it so much i ordered one   now it s her favorite  this hair dryer has a large hood so i can use fat curlers   it is easy to set up and is not as noisy as some dryers i have used   it is light weight and very stable when set up  it is a great product for the price  i used this product in a hotel on vacation  i loved it so much  that is why i purchased this one  it is a fabulous hair dryer  i mainly purchased this hair dryer to bring some order into our bathroom  a bit more expensive than a standard hair dryer  i e  just a dryer with a cord   but worth it   the dryer was easy to mount on the wall   the cord   dryer now stay out of way  and the night light  sufficient to light that way in the middle of the night  is a nice bonus  of course  the dryer does a good job as well   i can recommend this product   update  1 year later  works great   bought a 2nd one  a must have for freezy curly  unruly hair  makes blow drying a breeze i purchased one about 12 years ago   still going strong i use it every day also for touch ups  so i ve decided to get a new one for my daughter that will graduate college just in case she decides to move out       fairly light right price and combined with amazon service and reliability         priceless  go for it  you will not regret it  i had a smaller travel conair for years and it just died  i needed to make sure the next one was up to speed  this little dryer is perfect  i have long hair and i don t like to spend a ton of time drying my hair  so i need something powerful  i use this dryer as my everyday hair dryer  it s small size makes it easy to store and also not heavy to hold so your arm doesn t get sore  br   also comes with a switch so that you can adjust the voltage if you travel abroad  very handy  br   highly recommend this hair dryer  hair dryer stopped working after about a year   a half of use   worked great until one day  it stopped working altogther   kind of expected to be able to use this for a longer period of time  perhaps my expectations are too high   i have very curly hair   am used to blow drying it straight  have been doing it for  10 years  and using a flat iron to get it frizz free   this hairdryer is not as good as most of the reviews made it seem  the nozzle only covers a small area  and i still need to use a flat iron       however  the hairdryer is powerful  it cut 5 minutes off my hair drying time  20 min down to 15    another plus is that it is quieter than most  we ve owned one of these before and loved it   it hangs on the wall in our bathroom so it s always handy   when the first one broke my wife had to go back to the bulky old one she had until i found this on amazon  easiest way to make a wife happy  beware         i purchased this item just over 4 months ago and am recently having some problems with it working properly   it starts off really slow on high  and often doesn t get up to speed like it did before   it also smells like something is burning when i first turn it on   i called bespoke labs to get it replaced and was told that amazon com is not an authorized online seller and therefore they will not honor the 1 year warranty   bespoke will only replace the broken hairdryer for an additional  55 plus i have to ship it back to them in ca     while i loved the hair dryer  i m not willing to sink another  55  in to it   besides  who knows if the next one will work  i love this blow dryer  the first time i used it i couldn t believe how much volume and thickness i had in my usually limp hair  i rarely have to use a curling iron now because my frizzy ends have disappeared  definitely worth the investment  i bought this 5 months ago  and it croaked  just like that it starting to smell burned  w o smoke  and then it stopped  it wasn t the socket  it was the dryer   too bad  it was a good price and it when it worked  it worked well  the best part about it was the retractable cord    next   go for a brand name like conair or sasson   their dryers last  i really liked how this dryer worked   it produced a good stream of nicely heated air and seemd to dry my hair fairly well   however after 3 months of normal use  used it once a day for about 5 7 days a week    it suddenly stopped producing hot air   very disappointed    i used a sunbeam wall mount dryer for many years  when it died  i looked to find a replacement  but saw that sunbeam had changed the design a bit  fearing that they might have ruined the classic model  i bought this one instead because it looked in the picture like the former sunbeam design     what a mistake  the jerdon is clearly a poor knockoff of the original sunbeam  it s bulkier and heavier  the catches that clip in the handset part don t latch positively like the sunbeam did  just about everything about this dryer seems inferior to the sunbeam     the only thing that some people might like better is the heat level  this thing is hot  if you re one who likes to start the day with a singe on your scalp  this is the dryer for you  in fact  the dryer is so hot  it caught on fire after we owned it less than a year     so here i am on amazon again to buy another dryer  but this time  i ll do the right thing and get the 1632 instead  this is a great hair dryer  i love the retractable cord and the folding handle    makes it great for travel  the 1875 watts of power dry the wet hair quickly and i don t have any frizz problems  other hair dryers don t seem to put out as much hot air so i really like this one for the nice blast of heated air  i ve not had any problems with the cord and it s lightweight and easy to maneuver  br   recommended  this dryer is perfect for travel   it is not tiny  like some travel dryers  but is smaller than the normal hair dryer   the pullout cord is extra long  the handle folds for packing  it is powerful  and uses the ionic technology   it is perfect for me   i love that it is black and silver with the black part having a rubbery coating that keeps it from sliding off the countertop   excellent product  i bought this dryer after much debate over its price about a month ago   i had decided the price was worthwhile given how much more expensive it is at regular stores in the mall compared to amazon   although it is still on the pricey side  i feel this was an excellent investment  br    br   i have fairly long hair that i blowdry every morning  and this dryer really does speed up that process   it s true that the dryer doesn t seem to blow with much force  or with much heat  but it actually dries my hair much faster than any of my old brands  conair  vidal sassoon  with less noise and without me working up a sweat  br    br   i m not sure if it indeed makes your hair smoother or shinier    i have straight hair as is   but coworkers and friends have been commenting a lot lately on how healthy my hair has been looking since i starting using it  br    br   i guess the other comments on amazon not being an authorized dealer and therefore voiding the warranty can be a deterrant  but being able to save  100 compared to retail was significant enough for me to take a chance on that  i have owned two of this same product now   both have started to shoot sparks within less than one year   be warned   this is a hazardous dryer  great dryer  works well   lots of heat and volume when i need it  nice cooling button   dries my hair fast   amazon got it to me overnight when mine died  so i only went 1 day with bad hair   not bad  because i don t have time to shop at the brick and mortar  this hairdryer does exactly what it promises  dries hair fast and keeps the dryer handy but neatly out of the way  all for under  25  the only thing i don t like about it is the noise it creates  i wanted to buy the  quiet  version  but couldn t find it available anywhere  i m blown away  literally   this is the best hair dryer i ve ever owned  compact  powerful  super light weight  dual voltage   for under  15   are you kidding me   flicked the voltage switch using a coin  and it worked great when we were in italy  andis micro hair dryers rule  i love this hair dryer   it is the best one i have ever owned in terms of making my fine hair look amazing   i recommend this hair dryer to any one and be sure to use the large attachment to it for great results  bought this hairdryer to replace the same one that had been hanging on the wall for 10 years and finally died   was excited when the bracket was the same so didn t have to do anything but hang it up  then i used it   it doesn t get hot   blows nice warm air but doesn t get hot enough to style your hair   i now have this one hanging on the wall  unplugged  while i use one that i haul out of the drawer every morning  nicest blow dryer we ve ever had   actually does reduce frizz and dries extremely fast   worth every penny    asin b0009xh6xc andis 33700 hangup pro turbo 1600w wall mount hair dryer with night light    replace a nearly decade old unit that just finally wore out   works great  wish the night light was not quite so bright  this is a great hairdryer  it s light  and dries my hair fast  i was worried about frizzy hair  but the dryer doesn t make my hair frizzy  this is an excellent prouduct  it eliminates friz and drys your hair in half the time  i love mine  it s sensational   very  happy with the price and service from the shipper   my hair has never been smoother or shinier  this blow dryer gets really  really hot  it s a great product for a great price  let me just say this  i love pink  my whole room used to be painted pink  i wear pink a lot  i love that this hairdryer is pink     that being said  i think the color is the most redeeming quality for this thing  it s a hairdryer  people  not a car  personally  i don t care about torque or rpm or whatever fancy gadgets it throws in      it s still just a pink hairdryer  a really  really big pink hairdryer     it s heavy  it s hefty  so you better have a strong grip  and it does not fold over  the cord retracts  but i repeat  it does not fold over      it does have variable temps  which is nice i guess  it gets the job done  but so does my small hairdryer  and i don t think that one doubles as a weapon  and my arm doesn t hurt after using it     there s some sort of black  pointy attachment for this thing  i don t know what it does  if you do  good for you  but ya know what  it s still a really big  really expensive  pink hairdryer     and i love pink  and it gets the job done  i bought this item based upon the reviews found here at amazon  yes  it is small and powerful  easily carried  it is just about right  almost      from day one the bearings sound like they are going out  did i get a defective unit  if yours sounds like mine  you are wondering when it will be going out  but it still works so i keep using it  does the going out sound bother us  you bet it does      updated  12 30 2008  yep  it did go out about a week ago  so the sounds were the prelude of a unit wearing itself out   only lasted several months  the item is described as a soft bonnet hair dryer   the dryer works  but the bonnet is not at all soft   it occasionally irritates the neck because of stiffness where the hose joins the bonnet   the temperatures can get too hot  low heat is hotter than my previous hair dryer ever got on its maximum heat setting  watch out  looks sharp hanging up   small and compact and has good blowing action   only fault is that it only has two speeds and the heat setting is governed by the blower speed  but that is minor   would be nice to have a cool shot too   the cord hangup tab is a good idea to keep the cord out of the way   the dryer fits into the receiver fine  but it seems that it could be anchored into the holder a little better as it feels like it might fall out if bumped   it hasn t yet  so it might just be my imagination  this is the best dryer i have purchased  i own about 4  and this one dries my hair the quickest without frying it  some dryers use very high heat  but not enough power    this dryer is also not as heavy as other ones i have used  the price is good for the quality  this is a great blowdryer   i had one before and this one is a little different  but it works great   i love it   compact and the handle folds up which my old one didn t do  which is a great feature for traveling   high speed   dries hair quickly  very fast shipper too   thanks  love it  easy to install on wall but requires some drilling   three heat settings work well but i would like to have a setting that is air only like my old dryer had   night light is green but throws enough light to see way around bathroom at night   no way to turn night light off  i am tired of paying 85 dollars and up for a professional hairdryer that never seems to last more than 9 mos  is heavy with a bulky desighn and never fails to trip my breaker usually more than once  while blow drying a client  p s  stay away from hot tools  ive had 3 of them in 2  1 2 years the shipping was fast  and although the dryer itself is of a smaller scale it has more blowing power than i expected for its small size  its nice and light and easy to handle  it has yet to trip my breaker at work  its perfect for young  girls who are just learning to manuver a blowdryer and of course  the price is great  at this rate i could go through 3 a year and not spend what i normally would on another            downside is that the cord is short  its just a touch noisier than i would prefer  and i have dropped it once and the seam eria where the blowdryer is put together has come apart a little  but its still running   this is a great product for the money  i would buy again  this is our third oster wall hair dryer   we ve used them in hotels while on business trips and thought it would be great to have one at home       we love these hair dryers because they are easy to use and efficient   we don t have to reach under the bathroom sink to pull it out every morning or find a place to plug it in without bumping into anything else on the counter   it takes up very little space on the wall and is very easy to install  i was really excited when i bought this  269 dryer for  39 several months ago  but when i started using it i noticed immediately that it didn t really feel like it was drying my hair faster  it actually felt like it took longer than usual  so i went back to amazon to search for product specifics and couldn t find the wattage for this dryer anywhere  imagine my surprise when i did a google search and found that this dryer is for ethnic hair and has a powerful  1300 watts  powerful 1300 watts  are you kidding  no wonder it sucks  maybe it s good for ethnic hair  but for a caucasian girl with long fine hair it just adds about 10 minutes to my drying time  don t waste your money on this unless you are looking for a dryer that puts out as much air as a floor fan  the people who wrote rave reviews on this must have been brainwashed by the deal they got  no way would i ever pay  268 for this dryer  the cheapest wal mart travel dryer has more wattage than this  i have never spent this much on a hair dryer before in my life  but one weak moment i ordered it and i am not sorry one single bit  in this case  you do get what you pay for  it has a lot of drying power but does not blow your hair to the point it frizzes or feels really dried out  first this threw me because i was used to more hot air blowing out but after i finished using it on my hair for the first time  it was amazing  no over blowing  my hair felt softer and in better condition  and for some reason straighter and more styled  no need to hesitate on buying this  i ll never go back to a cheaper hair dryer again   if you are still trying to justify spending the money  look at it as saving money on extra conditioner for your hair   this thing is wonderful  this hairdryer is much more powerful than the conair i previously owned as it dries my hair in nearly half the time  it is a tiny bit quieter  but still makes a decent amount of noise  about the same as a powerful hand vacuum   it is a perfect size for any bathroom  we bought a white one for one bathroom and this black for another   the only thing i would change is to make the power cord recoil as it is nice and long  but must be wrapped up after each use or left to hang  that said  i still highly recommend this hair dryer  this hairdryer is much more powerful than the conair i previously owned as it dries my hair in nearly half the time   it is a tiny bit quieter  but still makes a decent amount of noise  about the same as a powerful hand vacuum    it is a perfect size for the bathroom   the only thing i would change is to make the power cord recoil as it is nice and long  but must be wrapped up after each use or left to hang   that said  i still highly recommend this hair dryer  bought it  didn t use it  wanted a silver one  picture looks silver  returned it  will get exactly what i want instead  i have owned several of these over the years and think they are one of the best dryers i have used  they don t have a lot of bells and whistles  just hi and lo settings   but if you want a light and powerful dryer that doesn t take up a lot of room  this is it  also like the very compact size of this unit  you won t get arm cramps trying to hold this while drying  the wall mount is a nice feature  this dryer dries my hair in about half the time i used to  5 minutes instead of 10   and i am not drenched in sweat after using it  i use it with the diffuser  t3 83807 tourmaline diffuser ii   on the high setting  and keep it very close to my head  it was pricey but it was a good buy  i stayed at a hotel that had these hair dryers  i liked it so much that i wrote down the name and looked it up  it is small  yet powerful  and not quite as noisy as my previous  powerful dryer  not disappointed so far  install was easy and quick  loved the extra little arm to hang up the excess cord   night light is really bright  i mean really bright    i think it s quiet   as in the lable is because of the lower speed  of the blower  motor  i prefer more air moving  dryer does a good job all in all  andis blow dryers are much better than the ones you buy in chain stores   they dry your hair much faster and make wavy hair easier to style  the only problem i find is that they are heavier than the store standards and your arms get tired  i recommend this dryer to anyone who wants great looking hair fast and easy arrived promptly  packaged well   and works great   perfect heat  doesn t fry your hair   nice attachments for directing heat to specific areas  i have very  very thick hair   great cord length  and perfect weight  this is a very simple  easy to use  and effective hair dryer at a nice price  i love it  i am so pleased with this dryer   works great and is so handy in my bathroom   now i don t have those cords hanging all over and it doesn t take up counter space   very handy  got one for my brother for his birthday also   two for the price of one on amazon      we are amazed and awed with the improvement in texture and shine of our hair   it travels great also     thanks andis for such a wonderful product  bought this hairdryer a month ago and as we speak it is in a landfill somewhere   what a piece of junk   just stopped working one day   would nt turn on at all  to return it would be more of a hassle and expense than its worth and conair knows this so they continue to produce inferior products knowing they won t get them back   the retractable cord worked when it felt like it   don t waste your money on this one  i purchased this hair dryer after using on on a trip and it was the hair dryer that was supplied by the hotel   i love the way it doesn t use a lot of heat   i also loved the way my hair looked after using this product  the ends of my hair did not look fried   after seaching the internet  i found that amazon had  what i determined  to be the most reasonable price  this dryer is worth the money   i ve been using cheaper hair dryers for years and finally opened the wallet and invested in a professional quality one   i don t notice that this dries my hair any faster  but it is shinier  smoother  and seems to have more body   for someone who has hair that has all the body and styleability of dental floss  this is a huge improvement   i like this hair dryer and i got a great price for it on amazon  this hairdryer works great i do not see any shine diffrence in my hair though transaction was smooth and fast service  purchased for domestic travel  solid construction  compact  and the high heat speed has a powerful air flow for such a small head size  drys hair fast  has low heat speed if you need it  very satisfied with purchase  this dryer does not blow very strong and takes a long time for hair to dry   would not recommend it even though price is good  i am very happy with this dryer  it is light  strong  and the retractable cord works much better than the last one i had  it is also not overly bulky  i highly recommend it  especially for the very reasonable price  am in the market for a fabulous dryer for my natural african american hair  i have heard rave reviews about the t3  which my stylist uses  however  the concerns regarding whether the manufacturer will honor the warranty if you buy from amazon turned me off  i noticed that there were mixed postings however on whether the manufacturer will or will not honor the warranty  so  after hunting around on amazon  i realized that there are two manufacturers selling the t3 on amazon  with a significant price difference  beauty collection and discount jungle  beauty collection specifically states in its warranty description that it will honor the 48 month manufacturer  i plan to buy the dryer  but read the product description before you buy and decide whether the difference in price is worth buying with the warranty  if you are looking for a dryer that will get your hair real straight and dry your hair fast this is the dryer for you  the dryer is very hot and you have to be very careful not to put the heat on your scalp directly  this blow dryer dries my hair quickly with no frizz  i love it and love the color  the only thing that might make it better is if the output was a lighter higher harder  but it gets the job done well  attractive and easy install   husband thinks it does not have enough power and we are hoping the cord will relax with use  great feature hanging on wall and not fighting with cords in drawer or cabinet  so we are going to try and adapt  this dryer gets the job done  just want it dry   it s fast and powerful and you can easily direct it   it also comes with two attachments  one for straightening  the other for zeroing down on problem areas   i love the color too   it s bright and cheery  i ve always thought that oster produced great products but not this time   i purchased this hair dryer in november 2007   this morning  without warning  it started smoking and glowing bright red inside   i was able to pull the plug  the gfi never tripped    i won t be buying another one of these hair dryers  i am super picky about my hair dryers   and while this is not the best one i ve ever had  my favorite was an 1875 watt helen of troy professional that died several years ago   it s not bad   unfortunately  in this day and age  the only dryers i can seem to find are ionic ones   for me ionic dryers   flat hair   so  with the choices so limited  this dryer is decent   i wish it had slow fan speed with high heat  but i can t be too choosy at this point  this dryer has great power and a variety of settings   the retractable cord is a great feature and keep the cords protected so that it doesn t get tangled  split  or caught up with other appliance cords     i like this hair dryer   but my old one  see link below  had a very nice feature that you could not only retract the cord  but also fold the handle up which was perfect for storage and traveling       asin b000bfjj7e conair 1875 watt ionic cord keeper hair dryer   i blow dry my hair every morning after my shower  works great    light weight in my hand    this is the second dryer i ve purchased   it is a powerful compact   dryer and i recommend it highly  this item is just what i wanted   enough power  ion  and the diffuser and concentrator attachments are great   the retractable cord is very convenient   i highly recommend this product  great dryer quite  does the job  the best dryer i have ever used  my hair is very curly and it gets it straight with out much work  have no complaints other then it s a bit heavy and the attachments seem to slip off easily   it works well and dries my hair without all the damage of a regular dryer   this is a salon quality dryer for a great price  i would recommend it  great hair dryer for a great price  you ll have to pay the same for a high end regular hair dryer at a drug store or department store   it gets fairly hot  and is quiet   it is heavier than a normal dryer  pros  many attachments  price is good  attractive  dries quickly  no damage     cons  so heavy to use and that factor alone is enough to cancel out any of the pros   the weight is also unbalanced  so when you grip the handle in the place that best balances it out  you wind up hitting buttons   the attachments fly off and hit you in the head midstream  especially the diffuser    not recommended   you can do better  hard to believe a hair dryer can make such a difference   this one does   hair feels amazing and it s incredibly fast   can t beat the price either  works great and fast too  design is easy to handle and manages my medium length hair without tangling  hair damp to dry in less than 20 mins  great value  i ve been using hair dryers since 1975  and this is by far the best i ve ever owned  it reminds me of the way hair dryers used to be designed  moderate heat but high air flow  that s the correct way to do it   the cheap mass market hair dryers started getting this backwards around the time they all transitioned from squirrel cage fans to radial fans  heating element wire is cheaper than decent fans motors  i guess  and if that turns a hair dryer into a blowtorch  so what    people who don t know any better will buy them anyway      this particular unit has a very long round cord  i can t vouch for the cord s durability  but i see no reason it wouldn t hold up  even if it were fragile  though  i d still want to own this hair dryer  cords are easy to replace  i ve put two on my massive ge steam iron  an old timer from the 1960s     in summary  then  this dryer is tough  heavy  quiet  comfortable  extraordinarily effective  and obviously built for the long haul  it is far  far above anything i ve seen in the stores since squirrel cage motors disappeared some years ago  i used the same brand hair dryer for 2 decades before buying this dryer   i was very satisfied with it from the moment i turned it on   it dries my hair fast and well   nobody knows i really have curly hair   i was apprehensive to try a new dryer but this was a good choice   i highly recommend it  i thought it worked great the few times i used it but i should have heeded what others wrote here   the bonnet is very cheap and became unusable after only a few times of use  i was not too sure about this with all the other reviews  but i bought it anyway  well i m so glad i did  this works great for me  i have medium hair about shoulder length  i put it on medium and it dried my hair with curlers  it never shut off  in fact it was a bit warm  i don t know if the other people got defective ones  but mine works just fine  good luck to anyone else who buys it  but it is not as compact as it seems  br   i wanted to replace my huge hairdryer with something br   smaller and this ended up being the same size as the one i had  br   also  it s ionic and supposed to not leave your hair frizzy but br   i did not notice any difference  great hairdryer   we used one in a marriott property and my wife liked it so much i found it on line and we ordered it that day   quieter than many other models we have had and feels sturdier   does not fold up  so if you want to travel  you might want something else   but for home use  it does great  i ve owned many hairdryers over the years   they seem to last a year or so then die a quick and sometimes painful death   none has been anything to get excited about   i decided to take a chance on the farouk deep brilliance  based on the great reviews  great price  and the farouk name   some may be put off by the bright orange color  but mine gets stowed in a cabinet  so it s not a decorative accessory  the quality is outstanding and hopefully will be around more that a year or two   even more impressive is the way it styles may hair   i have short hair and the high setting dries my hair in no time   i love the lower setting for styling with my round brush   it still provides plenty of heat to set the curve  but the air velocity doesn t blow my hair off the brush   my hair looks much shinier but with lots of volume   fantastic  i love this hair dryer so much   i used it at a friends house several times and finally just bought my own   sephora sells it for  216  after tax  and amazon  145   money well spent   my hair is long and thick and it usually takes about 12 15 minutes to dry and that s after i ve towel dried it  applied makeup  fixed the bed  etc     my t3 takes 4 minutes  i ve actually timed it   i know its  just a hairdryer as my husband would say but if you are anything like me in the morning every second counts  i love it and amazon always comes through with the best prices    can t wait to buy the straightening iron  i ve had my bespoke labs 83808 se for a few months now and really love it  i have thick  wavy hair and am really hard on my blow dryers   and i ve had many over the years  this one is  hands down  the quietest  fastest drying dryer i ve ever had  and it makes my hair shiny and smooth  not frizzy  the lint filter is easy to access and clean  in brief  there s just nothing not to like about it  it s pricey   but  given that i ve gone through one or two lower priced blow dryers every year for the past heaven knows how many years and that it seems like this one s going to last a long time  i think it s actually the most economical choice  this is an excellent hair dryer that out performs the cheezy and inexpensive brands out there  do not get cross minded when choosing this hair dryer because it get the job done right  some people complain about how heavy this thing is and i can only tell you that any professional hair dryer is going to pretty close to this weight  overall  this hair dryer is the best you can get for the money and it will perform as described  i love this product   my hairdresser told me to buy it and i couldn t be happier  better that i expected always used a comb dryer i am a changed person no more combs for me i purchased this hair dryer for my wife and she likes it very much  she said it worke s as good as a more expensive one she had used  the on off buttons on the handle are a small problem  they can be hit by accident  very pleased with this product  drying time is cut in half compared to other blow dryers  the elchim 1800 r b hairdryer performs great  i should know because i ve had 4 of them   i keep buying them on average 1 18mos   this is not good   the systemic problem with them is that the cord breaks a wire internally right near the top just below the rubber protector  i m thinking the rubber protector may just be the problem  this has happened to me on all 4 elchims i have purchased  my hair stylist confirms what i have found  he said that he constantly has to repair the cords on elchims  the cord is not round as stated in some other reviews   it is the flat type  wish the manufacturer would fix this regretable situation  this is the last time i order anything but books thru amazon   i have a major probelm every time   i ordered the featherweight dryer with a diffuser   instead i got the special edition with no diffuser for more money   there was no contact information on the order    no phone number    i called amazon and got no help at all   i had to spend more money to order the diffuser   so i ended up spending more money and did not get the product i ordered through the amazon site  definitely a good product and i believe in conair quality and realiability  but this hair dryer is little bulkier  otherwise it works great  we got this for a trip and it was great because it had a folding handle and retractable cord  made packing super easy  it got real hot and i recommend it for anybody that needs a great dryer  it looks great on the wall  but just isn t very powerful  takes much longer to dry my hair  wish i had known  i like the designer look of this hair dryer  it is fairly quiet as advertised and the wall mount certainly adds to the convenience  i bought the first one and hung it on the wall in my guest bathroom   within two months  it went dead   bought a second identical one and it went dead in the same period of time with no one using it   too bad because i really liked the light and it worked great when it worked  delivered promtly after my order  works as advertised but a bit noisy  overall rating  good i ve owned this dryer for only a few weeks  so i cannot speak to its longevity   this is my third hair dryer with a cord reel  which i find convenient   the first one was ok and worked well  but was noisy   my second one    asin b000bfjj7e conair 1875 watt ionic cord keeper hair dryer     which i used for only a couple months  was also noisy   the cord in it was also too short  4 feet  and when retracting it  rewound so quickly that the plug would whip around and hit me painfully in the hand   i had to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord   it also had only fast hot and slow warm settings   i got fed up with it  so i looked for new options at a local target   i found this dryer and was hesitant to pay twice as much for it as i did the previous ones   i couldn t imagine what could be special enough about it to justify two and a half times the cost   when i tried it  i was quite surprised   the first thing i noticed is that it is heavier and feels very solid and well built   i don t care about the weight  it takes me only a minute or two to dry my medium length  for a man  hair   the next surprise was that it is extremely quiet  even at high speed   i no longer have to turn up my radio to hear the news while drying my hair   it has independent controls for heat and speed   i usually like to use high heat with the low speed so it doesn t blow my hair so much   the 5 foot cord retracts slowly and safely and is just the perfect length for my situation   i would not describe the quietness of the dryer as slightly better than the cheaper driers i have used before  it is a dramatic difference   i have often wondered about the potential hearing loss my old dryers might cause  but didn t worry too much because it didn t take very long to dry my hair   if i still had long hair  i would be seriously concerned about the noise from a cheap dryer   as for how well my hair looks after using it  i notice no difference from the other dryers   my hair if very fineand thick with some wave  so it is pretty easy to care for   it will frizz in high humidity  but i live in denver and humidity is not a problem here   i have not tried this in a humid environment   i highly recommend this dryer   update on 2010 10 17  this dryer is still working great and i still consider it the best dryer i ve ever used   update on 2011 12 29  i cut my hair shorter last april and no longer use the hair dryer   it was still working perfectly after three years  on the 5th day of use ever  this drier burned off a whole section of my hair  i smelled burning and turned off the drier  ran my hand over my hair and the whole section fell to the floor   the hairs were scorched and melted together   my hairdresser always comments on the great health of my long hair  i ve never processed it  i never even get split ends  so that s not even an issue here   i bought this drier because my last revlon drier was great   never again  i ve complained to revlon  still waiting to hear from them  product works fine and installs easily   but you should make sure that you have an outlet and a place to mount the dryer that allows the cord to reach the outlet and the dryer to reach your head  with the cord from the dryer only about six feet when fully extended  finding that perfect spot is not necessarily as simple as you might think  i purchased this for my trip to florida where i would be staying with friends who didn t have a hair dryer    this is a wonderful little dryer  i have recently been a backpack traveler and this folds down and fits in any bag you would want to travel with  hair dryer works great  br   mounting plate was a little bit tricky to install though   could have a better design  br   all in all  a satisfactory purchase  i read all the reviews and decided to give this hair dryer a chance since it was such a great price  i have to say that it s lighter then the one i had before and it s super quiet and i don t feel like i have to use ear plugs just to dry my hair  it dries my hair quickly  i thought about getting an ionic dryer but my hair dresser said that it really wouldn t make a difference  i m very happy with this dryer and i m going to buy one for my mom  installation is fairly easy   the convenience of having the dryer on the wall  along with the cord management  was as hoped for   however  it failed after a year  with smoke and burning plastic odor  the failure occurred in the wall mount area  given the nature of the failure  i can t recommend this dryer  br    br   if you need the convenience  i d recommend just buying a regular hair dryer along with a nice universal wall mount   i ve noticed that many hotels no longer have wall mounted hair dryers  probably to help save on similar maintenance issues  this product drys your hair quickly therefore causing less damage  it is about as loud as any other average hair dryer and the attachments are great for straightening and styling your hair  this is the second time i purchase this product and i am satisfied every  time   i recommend it  like many out there  my last conair dryer lasted nearly 20 years   this new conair was very good for the first 6 months but now it only wants to remain in the convenient fold down storage position   it s like someone broke it s little red neck  my wife has had the dryer for 4months now it started not heating up as much in the last couple weeks  now it just blows cold air went to look for the warranty caus  one of the reasons i bought this  200 dryer was the fact it had a 5yr warranty   not         i started looking for the serial number only to find it had been removed from the box you can clearly see the location where it used to be and was torn off    i came back here to check it out and found all these posts on non authorized reseller bull   it i do alot of research when i buy stuff  making sure i pay enough money to get quality and not buying cheap   there is no way to know amazon is not an authorized reseller this has been a complete rip off make sure you heed the warning    buy elswhere   make sure it has the serial number on the box i m really pissed about this now we have to spend more money on another blow dryer this sucks   this was an excellent buy and a great product   i saved around  20 00 as compared to discount stores in my area   the shipping was supposed to be 5 7 business days and i received it in 2 days   i am always very satisfied with amazon com purchases  this dryer is perfectly adequate   i m not as exhuberant as some other reviewers  but i can t really find anything wrong with it   size and weight are fine   noise level is fine   i find the controls in a perfectly normal spot and i don t have trouble with them   i don t think my hair dries any quicker than with my old dryer  but i do have less static flyaways   my hair seems smooth and bouncy and healthy   not sure how much is due to the dryer   the one strange thing is i couldn t find anywhere that said how many watts it has  and now i own it and still  none of the packing materials  box  insert or even the dryer itself says how many watts  which is odd   but it has enough power for me  my old dryer had 1875    for  40  its fine   had i paid the  259 supposed sticker price  i d be disappointed   i ve never used the more expensive models though so i don t know if they are any different  this thing has unbelievable bang for buck   it s compact  comfortable  and powerful   if you need a compact hairdryer buy this one  you won t be dissapointed  i do my share of traveling with work and personal   i noticed that i always used the hair dryer that was hanging up in the hotel bathroom   i rarely used it at home   i realized the convenience of ready to go made the difference   no more cords to untangle before plugging in   i am extremely satisfied with my new andis 30975   plus now there isn t an ion to be found on my head  i bought this hair dryer at a great price and i really like it  it has a lot of power and it folds easily for when i travel  oh  and it s purple     this is absolutely the most amazing hair dryer ever  i purchased mine about 7 years ago and i use it every day  i love the gail force wind that it sends out to dry my curly thick hair in no time at all  it is a bit heavy  but i do not leave home without it when i travel  my girlfriends love it when i bring it  too  well  after 7 long years together  i am sad to report that it died  ugh  thanks to amazon com i ll have another in just a few days at a fraction of the cost of my original  i hope to have another fabulous 7 years with this one   it arrived quickly  was a beautiful red  light as a feather and  on high  dries hair super quickly   also  it s much quieter than my previous one with all the added power  used this hairdryer in a hotel on vacation and loved it so much i had to order one for home as soon as i got back   doesn t have a separate selector for temperature  and seems to be hotter on the higher setting that the lower ones  but it works just great for me   would definitely recommend  i never realized a hair dryer could actually make your hair feel soft  this one does that and dries my hair in 2 seconds  okay   maybe not 2 seconds  but it really is fast  oster professional 76932 710 wall mount hair dryer br    br   reasonably priced and works like a charm  this is a great deal  it heats up quick  the shape it blows is perfect  who dries in a circle  not i  easy to handle and can be stroked like a brush  best part  intake screen is an ease to clean  worth every penny  i love this dryer  i ll never buy a less expensive one from a discount store again  this one is quieter and even though it doesn t blast you with hot air  like the less quality ones   it works really well  my best friend bought it first  and her hair is un managable most days  she loves it  so i bought it too  and i love it  a great deal too  i originally ordered the farouk deep brilliance because my old conair hair dryer finally went to hair appliance heaven   this model was among the best reviewed and it was definitely the most affordable        i cannot say that i find it to be a whole lot different from other dryers i have owned but i feel like it dries a bit faster so it does save me time   my only complaint is that i wish it had come with a diffuser  i love this hair dryer   when i read the previous reviews i was skeptical but i have heard really good things about this brand so tried it   this hair dryer is very quiet and it dries very quickly   i have thick hair and my old dryer was very loud and it got very hot but it made my hair feel hard and burned afterwards   this one leaves my hair feeling very soft and manageable   i love this hair dryer   the buttons are in odd positions but i love the dryer anyway  mounted very quickly in the same holes of the previous dryer  works great and a  good value  previous dryer cost 3 times more and worked the same  purchased this for a gift and the person i gave it to keeps thanking me for the purchase  suppose to be one of the best out there  this hair dryer is wonderful   i was worried before i got it that it wouldn t have enough power to dry my hair because i have long hair that takes a while to dry   once i recieved it and tried it out i fell completely in love with it   it is the most quiet hair dryer that i have owned  it is easy to take the filter out to clean  it doesn t eat my hair when it is too close to my head  it doesn t burn my hair but the best thing is that it gets hot enough to dry my hair and has enough power to get the job done quickly  it does get a little heavy after a while but what hair dryer of that size doesn t   the on off buttons can be switched easily while using if held directly by the buttons but i haven t had too much trouble with that issue  this was a replacement for a jerdon hairdryer that we had had for years  the new one has a sleeker look  is much quieter    does the job  drying your hair  faster  i was skeptical when my hairstylist recommended i invest in a ceramic dryer  since i ve generally avoided heat styling on my very bleached hair for fear of further damage  this dryer has won me over completely  it dries my hair quickly and leaves it soft   again  having chemically treated  porous hair means that some dryers have left my hair feeling crunchy and looking frizzy  not so with deep brilliance  i think it s a great product at a reasonable price    40 is a lot cheaper than most professional quality ceramic models i ve looked into  for someone with damaged hair needing tlc  this is awesome  i can actually use less styling products thanks to the smooth finish i get just from the dryer  i didn t find myself wanting more power  as some reviewers have mentioned  but this may be because my hair is porous and not terribly thick   the only negatives i can think of would be that the styling attachments become quite hot very quickly  thus you have to be careful when removing them right after use   and perhaps for someone with very thick hair  1300 watts won t cut it  pros   ceramic heating component  lightweight  quiet    cons   the  blow  component isn t all that strong  has only a low and high setting  plastic casing feels cheap  but that s probably partly why it s so light   obnoxious color    this could be a 5 star blow drier if they had just given it a little more power  i purchased it because i was excited about the good reviews  it does a pretty good job  but the problem is that the  blow  action of it is really weak  to use it i have to use the funneling head attachment  but there is almost no airflow on the low setting  because there isn t a very high volume of air running through the dryer  the air is also a bit hotter than i d really like it to be and i worry about damaging my hair    i find that i need to cut my hair more frequently since i ve purchased this blow drier  i m going to shop around in the near future for a better dryer  it s ok for now  and if not for the ceramic heat i would have returned it  but i wouldn t get it again  bought this unit to replace a sunbeam 1500 watt model that had a broken fan blade  was dropped on a tile floor    i miss the three temperature settings available on the older model   this one only has two   otherwise it is a good product  this is my first ion dryer  my hair does not seem any shinier than when i used my old non ion dryer but amazon s price can t be beat  i only paid  17 for it  it is fast  i dry my hair in aobut 15 minutes   the cool setting option is nice  this dryer works well and was very easy to install  directions were very clear and it is now anchored firmly on the wall  turns off automatically when dryer is put back in holder  this is a nice feature  all in all  very nice product  none available  i bought this hair dryer close to a month ago  overall i am satisfied with the dryer itself  the built in nightlight i thought would help me save from taking up another outlet for a separate nightlight  however  the nightlight stopped working after only about 5 days  it still comes on occasionally  when it feels like it   when it is on  it is very bright  one other improvement i would like to see is where it plugs into the wall  i would like to see a 90 degree plug so that the cord does not stick out so far from the wall  for my particluar bathroom setup  the cord sticking out gets in my way  not bad for the price though  this hair dryer worked better than i expected   i have long hair that easily gets frizzed from overdrying   this hair dryer gave just enough heat to dry my hair fastly and did not frizz my hair   this hair dryer is well worth the money  i have been through a lifetime of hairdryers and this one tops the list  it s powerful but doesn t blast your hair beyond recognition   especially at the lower speed and on warm  not having to deal with wrapping up the cord is such a plus   the retractable cord works beautifully and saves space in my small bathroom  this is a great hair dryer  it works fast and my hair has never looked better  i never thouht i would spend that much on a dryer  but it has been well worth it       i almost didn t get it because of the reviews on here about unauthorized dealers and whatnot  it was a great price though so i went ahead anyway  i m glad i did  i don t know if somethng changed  or if those reviewers were just looking in the wrong place for the serial number  but mine had everything needed in order to register it with no problems  this wall mounted hair dryer is so nice    i also have the sunbeam 1500 but i prefer this one   it easily comes off the cradle  it is fairly quiet  compared to the sunbeam  and the design is just more user friendly   spend the extra few bucks on this one   it s a great product  im very happy with this dryer it is just as good as my chi dryer the shipping was very fast the price was excellent i would highly recommend this dryer  im a hairdresser and everyone i work with was intersted in it when they saw the color of it it really works just as good as my old chi dryer  love this item     very quiet    you will love it      this is a great dryer  it blows hard which is what i wanted  i have short bleached hair  i don t use the attachments  i haven t noticed that the ion feature has done anything different for my hair  it has a nice long cord which i also like  some reviewers have mentioned it being heavy  not true  maybe for a three year old  but not an adult  it just feels like a nice solid  well made dryer  it s louder than my last dryer  but not too loud  i don t think that whole ion thing does anything no matter which dryer you use  my hair is the same  with or without ions  what smooths it out is the fact that it blows nice and hard  that will probably change though as the filter gets clogged inside  that remains to be seen  i m happy with it  this is a nice dryer   it dries hair in about half the time as others i have used   it would have been really nice if it had come with a diffuser though   i can t find a diffuser that fits this  so i have not gotten to use it on myself yet   but it dries my nieces hair much faster than other dryers  loved that it had three heat settings and two speeds  did what a dryer was suppose to do  however  it is a bit noisy and it crapped out on me pretty quickly  from other reviews  i would say don t buy it if you want a hair dryer that lasts more than a year to two years max  excellent  i love my farouk d b  hair dryer   as a mom i don t have hours to style my hair and feel good    but now with this flat iron  and i also got the farouk deep brilliance flat iron  i can straighten style my hair in 20 min  i have just over the shoulder length hair that s wavy      i want to add  i first learnt about farouk chi products from my sister who got her flat iron and hair dryer as a gift from a friend who s hairstylist  and this is the exact same flat iron hair dryer but packaged as deep brilliance line   same great product different packaging and on sale  great dryer  works much faster than my old conair did  and does not leave my wavy hair frizzy  i noticed that i did not need to use my flat iron following use of this dryer unless i just wanted to  which is great  less heat damage   having only had the product for about a month or so  i can t speak to the longevity of this product  of course  but it seems quite durable in comparison to drug store brands  the shipping was incredibly fast  i must add  we wanted one of these after staying in a hotel that had them  the one in the hotel blew a lot harder than this  still i am pleased with the dryer and we even got a free upgrade  the box ours was in was labeled as this one  but what was inside was actually the ionizing version  nice bonus  but not sure if it really helps  still identical in specs   one thing i had to do was take the back off and bend around most of the led s used in the nightlight  i also colored the inside of the clear plastic with a sharpie  this was to reduce the brightness of the night light  it would have been handy for a hallway bathroom but was too bright for our bedroom  we love it after the modification  great hair dryer  dries hair very quick  my daughters have very long hair and they love it as well  it is the same model the pros use  i have been very happy with this hairdryer  it is fast and leaves my hair shinner than my old hair dryer  love it  this is the best hairdryer i have ever owned  i have waist length chemically straightened hair that is normally  thick course and curly hair  i have about 5 inches of curly re growth and i don t need to use my flat iron to blend it in with my straitened hair  this dryer dries super fast and leaves hair soft and less frizzy  very quie too  i use minimal product on my hair now with this dyer  well worth the money  i m buying one as a back up and have recommended it to many of my friends  love it  loved this hair dryer  didn t even need a new hair dryer  but at this price  i couldn t resist  i figured my old one would break eventually  i decided to make sure it worked  in case i needed to return it  wow  i couldn t believe how soft my hair was  my hair is healthy  shoulder length  a little wave  a little frizz  i usually had to tame with biosilk silk therapy after drying  but with this dryer  i don t need to use anything  my hair is silky  bouncy  soft and pretty  it dries faster than my old one and it s quieter  big plus since my baby s bedroom is right next to the bathroom   just what you would expect for a  250 blow dryer    i work at a hair salon and have told all of the girls about this deal  the air is hot hot hot  it dries my hair very quickly and my hair is no longer frizzy and a knotted mess after i blow dry it  it is sooooo quiet which is exactly what i needed  my other dryer was incredibly loud   this dryer doesnt even sound like it  is on  it has a low   high  and 2 heat settings    its working great for me  i would highly recommend  this blow dyer is the best and a deal at this price  i used it and it was so quiet i couldnt believe it  it also took no time to dry my hair even on the medium setting  i have thick ethnic hair and it left it very manageable and soft  i recommend this dryer  its not a looker but it gets the job done  whoever said it was heavy is mistaken  its not heavy at all  the comb attachment is great also  this hair dryer is the best   it dries your hair in half the time a regular hair dryer would do it   it really helps for an on the go mom  it is okay  it doesn t get hot enough and the buttons are located where you hit them with your fingers   i am not crazy about it and certainly would want more heat fromit t3 is the best hair dryer i have ever owned   i m a 50 something professional with thinning  color treated hair that is frizzy and easily dried out   this machine leaves my hair shiny  fuller and healthy looking with no friz   feel like i have a new head of hair   will buy a 2nd dryer for the office  i bought this hair dryer after doing a ton of research and thought it would be a good investment   when i first started using it  it worked great   i was amazed at how quickly it dried my hair and how shiny it looked afterwards   i have naturally curly hair and prefer it straight so i used this to dry it straight  along with a round brush  and it did the job amazingly well  br    br   well i had this for a little over a year when all of a sudden one day it started shooting out some sparks   i couldn t believe it   i turned it on another day just to see if it even turned on and it did but you could see the coils in it started to get red and then shoot out some sparks   this wasn t even overused or anything   in fact since i was pregnant at the time i bought it  i had a hard time standing up for too long so i only used it once or twice a week   after that little use it was already not working properly in just over a year   in fact  for about 4 months out of that first year  i didn t even use it right after i had my son   that was way too short of a time and too much money spent on an item that wasn t working properly  br    br   i am very diasspointed with this and will never buy anything by this company ever again  br    br   if you need a good hairdryer  look elsewhere   i m just glad and lucky that the sparks didn t land on my hair and cause a fire or anything  oh my gosh   this hair dryer is so perfect   i opened the box the night it arrived at my door   took out my new hairdryer  plugged it in  and wow   you could just feel the power  yet so quiet  but so strong   it heated up immediated   it s very well made of high quality materials  take it from me  i am one of the biggest sceptics you could ever meet   i love this hair dryer so much  i am afraid to show it to one of my dearest friends for fear of hurting her feelings  as she just got a new pink chi hair dryer for christmas   personally  i do believe this is the same exact hair dryer  it just doesn t have chi printed on the side of it   who doesn t love orange   go illini   thanks again amazon for carrying such high quality products   i am thrilled that i have found you  i bought this hair dryer in hopes that it would do a better job than my old revlon ceramic ion dryer  my hair is almost shoulder length  very textured and thick   with my old revlon it took me 20 minutes to dry my hair  i ve been using this dryer for one week now and it takes about 8 minutes to dry my hair  while it dries hair quickly   it s extremely gently and leaves my hair softer and more manageable than it has been in a very long time  i m thrilled with its performance and the price can t be beat  i like the convenance of it hanging on the wall and the night light is nice   but it doesn t seem like a 1600 watt hair dryer  it has  very little power and the power switch tends to turn off if you don t hold the handle just right during use  if you want a high end hair dryer for the right price  you ve come to the right place  i was looking into chi hairdryers   200  300  when i found this one by farouk  i decided to go ahead and try it out  and i love it  the comb attachment is my favorite part   it kind of massages my head while i use it and it makes my hair less frizzy  and that s saying something since i live in texas    the nozzle attachment is also easy to use and gives a great blowout  it s just a great hair dryer and i recommend it to anyone  i bought this dryer based on the user reviews and am very pleased  it has a lot of drying power  it s light  it s quiet  it s nicely balanced  it s not necessary to grip the handle to hold the dryer  it will balance in the crook of your left thumb  so your hand and arm won t get tired from holding it  i can t say for certain  since i don t have carpal tunnel syndrome  but this may be a great dryer for people who suffer from it since there s no need to clinch a fist to hold it  though i was at first disappointed that i can t remove the screens to clean them  and will need to do it with the vacuum cleaner  i later decided that for price and performance  this is a pretty great dryer  great little dryer with lots of power  compact size and wall mount save space  don t let that compact size deceive you  though  because it dries hair very quickly  i bought the t3 featherweight for my wife as a christmas gift for my wife   she has extremely thick hair and drying it takes a very long time    after purchasing the t3 from an authorized dealer  i found the good housekeeping review that gave a favorable review of the revlon tourmaline ionic  since the revlon is 1 10th the cost  i bought one at target and gave both to my wife for christmas       i was hoping that she would find the revlon comparable and we could save the expense of the t3   no such luck   she first used to t3 and found that it was much quieter than her current dryer and that it reduced the time it took to dry her hair by about 10 minutes   when she next used the revlon  she ended up burning her hair and refuses to ever use it again   she s been using the t3 for about three weeks as remains very happy with it      being the more analytical one  i decided to do a scientific comparison between the two   note that i only had one sample of each dryer and i didn t use calibrated instruments  so these observations are only useful in comparing the two samples that i had      the first and most important difference concerned the temperature of the air exiting these two dryers while set for high output and hot temperature   the t3 held a fairly consistent temperature that most of the time fell between 190 and 210 degrees   extremes fell between 180 and 230 degrees  but these were for only a second or two before the temperature returned to 200   10 degrees       the revlon was much less consistent   its temperature continuously fluctuated between 130 and 235 degrees  once i observed the temperature spike to almost 260 degrees   i must have been one of these spikes the burned my wife s hair   i took measurements over three different periods and noticed wide fluctuation during each one   keep in mind that i only had one sample of each dryer so these problems may be caused by a defective unit and not indicative of the entire line       both dryers are very quietcompared to those that my wife has used in the past   the t3 ran at about 100 decibels at the intake and output ends and about 90 decibels on the side  from one foot away  the dryer ran from 78 to 84 decibels    the revlon was a little louder  running about 105db at the ends to 90db on the side   from one foot  it in ranged from 82 89 decibels   these measurements were taken in our bathroom which has almost no sound absorption       the revlon did push out more air   on the high settings  the air exiting the revlon had almost twice the force of that of the t3    on the low setting  t3 had about 75  of the force of the revlon       bottom line   the revlon had temperature problems and burned my wife s hair   if that could be fixed  it would be a great dryer as it s 1 10 the cost on the t3   but  right now  there s no way my wife is going to give up her t3  i researched all the hairdryers on amazon  and this one seemed like a great product at a great price   unfortunately  one huge design flaw has prevented me from using it   the cord keeper function broke after about 3 months of use  so in order to use it i have to either     1  be within 12 inches of the socket  or   2  i have to fold the cord up after pulling it out and hold on tight the entire time i m drying       a very frustrating experience  buyers   beware  i have used this dryer for almost 3 years now  my daughter liked it so much that i bought this for her this christmas  she now is as happy as i am   it is fairly light weight but has the power of a professional  you can t get much for  20 these days   however  an andrew jackson will get you the conair 209r ion shine 1875 watt hair dryer from amazon com  and your even have some change left over   this dryer produces an impressive jet stream of air  with a selection of 3 heat settings   the technical specifications boast clouds of negatively charged ions neutralize positive charges that are in the air and reduce the static electricity that causes fly away frizzies and dulls hair   well  i don t know what all of that means but i will admit that my hair is not frizzy after using this dryer   there is also a cold shot button  which quickly removes heat from the air output  which is a great feature   the dryer has a little weight to it  but it is not bulky and seems to be balanced quite well   all hair dryers are fairly noisey but this conair 209r ion shine is quieter than most of my previous dryers  br    br   one of my favorite features of this model  the built in cord retractor  seems to be getting negative comments from other reviewers here on amazon   common sense tells me that i should hold onto the heavy power adapter with one hand while holding in the cord release buttong with the other   you easily control the retraction speed this way  which prevents the end from whipping around as most people are complaining about   it s really not a big deal and doesn t take much effort on the user s part  br    br   i do wish that this dryer had three air speed settings  since high is sometimes too harsh  and the low setting is usually too soft   overall  for less than  20 00 this is a real bargain of a hair dryer and i couldn t be much happier with my purchase   thanks for the great deal amazon    o  works great  same dryer used by my hair stylist   here s the caveat   since i bought it from discountjungle via amazon com  the manufacturer would not honor their 4 year warranty   they told me they only warranty products sold  at full retail cost  by their authorized vendors  adding that hair dryers sold by amazon com or by discountjungle were often used  not new  or knock off copies of their product   the manufacturer strongly recommended that i return the product to discountjungle  and buy one from their website  or from nordstrom  one of their few vendors   then the manufacturer assured me they would warranty the hair dryer   i phoned discountjungle  explained all this to them  and was assured that mine was brand new  sure looked new to me   and that discountjungle would honor the 4 year warranty   i got that in writing from them  and then i was able to start using the hair dryer   it was no fun going through all this   just be prepared    with a four year warranty i had to try it and now i m in love  it doesn t take an hour for me to dry my hair  without blowing all of my curls apart in a big frizzy mess  it is one of the lightest full size hair dryers that i ve owned  it is reasonably quiet and the buttons are in the right spot and don t accidentally turn on and off while drying  i have long permed curls and having a good hair dryer can make or break my day  after many throw away dryers i think i have found a new best friend  my husband got me this expensive blow dryer for christmas after hearing me complain how long it takes to dry my long hair   that of which i recently chopped 6 inches off   i have a new baby  and would rather spend my time with her instead of drying my hair   so this seemed like the perfect product     i have long  fine ish  straight ish hair   after giving this dryer a good week for a test drive  my hair only seemed flatter and had more static   just to make sure it wasn t the weather or my shampoo  i tried my ol   20 conair and the life came back to my hair      bottom line   feel free to try it out  but i m spending my money elsewhere   also be warned about the serial number missing   this is the best standard blow dryer on the market plenty of power and heat nothing else compares this will keep that 80 s hair blown back for shure this was made for bon jovi   rod stewart types  i love the way this hair dryer works on my hair   way less frizzies than my regular old hair dryer  the cord is extra long and the bright orange color is wow  however  the unit is a bit heavier than what i m used to   also  the location of the hi  low and off button is such that i find myself accidentally changing the heat setting while in use  otherwise  i love this produce and highly recommend it  i made this order  after i got it  i found out it wasn t working  i plugged it   it refused to come on  it was a pure waste of my money because what s the point if i can t use it  i should have gotten something better or more mature  now i regret buying it  this is a great dryer   dries my hair very fast and seems to help with static electricity   it s a little pricey but if you have long hair it s worth it  this is a good high end hair dryer at a cheap hair dryer price   after my last cheap one stopped working  i saw this and figured i would splurge     why i am happy     it is light and quiet   it dries hair quickly   it has a long cord   the comb attachement is handy and securly clicks on  it is bright orange so you will not lose it       both myself and dd have fizzy hair   after drying her hair with the comb attachment is was softer and less frizzy    the result was wow     my hair    used the dryer as i was brushing my teeth and wiping down the counter so it still came out frizzy but when i used my chi iron on it  the process was quicker and my hair was smoother       this is a good product  only problem     is it takes some pressure to release the button for the cord to recoil  but that is about it  i like it and it works great  this is a great product   i wish i had bought it years ago   works great  was easy to install   i love it  i am very impressed by this blow dryer   i have had blow dryers before which i have purchased at target or walgreens but when my current one broke i thought i would try a more expensive one   i was even happier to get a more expensive one at a great price   this dryer dries the hair fast without frizzing it out   the hair dries soft and maintains shine   my hair felt so much more silkier than with my other blow dryer   the dyer is also light weight which is a plus   i now know it pays to get a more expensive model   you won t be disappointed with this one  i was really surprised when i gotr this hair dryer   it was way better than what i expected for the price   i was really thrilled and i am really satisfied with this product i absolutely love this hairdryer  my hair is healthier  shinier and i feel like i m done in no time  i was really looking forward to this  got it in the mail  plugged it in and it did not work  i am sending it back  lightweight and super fast   with a vented roll brush  this leaves my hair looking sleek and healthy in record time   i can t remember the last time that i left the house with a completely dry head of hair   it used to take way too long to dry   not anymore   i also like the little bling added to the handle of this special edition  se  model   worth every penny  lightweight and super fast  with a vented roll brush  this leaves my hair looking sleek and healthy in record time  i can t remember the last time that i left the house with a completely dry head of hair   it used to take way too long to dry  not anymore  i also like the little bling added to the handle of this special edition  se  model  worth every penny  not only does this dry my hair faster than my older dryer  and it s light  it actually creates lasting body for my fine straight hair that i ve never had  and leaves it shiny and looking like a million bucks  best  130 i ve spent in a long time  and cheaper than more frequent hair cuts  that s for sure  unit was compact and stylish   unlike most  it had a magnetic mount to hold unit in place where most might have cheap clips that can break   my only complaint is the mounting bracket does not hold unit tightly and seems unstable   i put an additional screw through the unit to hold it to the wall securely  my hair gets dry and brittle very easily  since i was younger i ve avoided using hair dryers  except for in the winter  because they would make my hair so dry it would look gray  i decided to purchase this hair dryer due to its advertised features  i was not disappointed  i have had long hair  down to mid thigh  all my life and it takes only 10 15 minutes to dry with this dryer  i was so happy with the dryer i decided to buy one for my mom  who also has long hair  for christmas  i would recommend this hair dryer to anyone who has long  or light colored hair that gets frizzy or looks overly dry easily    especially in the winter months if you live in the north   like i do  the filter works well and is easily cleaned  the dryer itself is quieter than any other hair dryer that i ve owned  great buy  very happy  pros     fits well in hand and is easily maneuverable    puts out high volumes of air at a high enough temperature    very compact  fits in a very small space    night light is surprisingly useful  it lights the way to the bathroom without being so bright as to be distracting    cons     power cord length is not adjustable    included mounting screws anchors are flimsy    i bought this andis dryer to replace a similar type conair unit that died after about a year s use   my wife s habit of leaving her non hanging dryer and tangle of cords all over the sink and vanity motivated me to get a replacement fast     the dryer does its job    drying    very well   the compact handset is easy to maneuver and it puts out a surprisingly high volume of air at the right temperature  which is a must for those with long or extra thick hair     this is the smallest unit of its kind i ve seen   the mounting bracket is barely wider than the dryer  which makes putting it into tight places a snap     the relatively minor disadvantages have to do with the installation   first  the power cord length cannot be adjusted   it is one continuous cord from the bottom of handset  through the mounting bracket  and down to the gfci power plug   some competing dryers have an electrical junction in the bracket which allows you to shorten the wire running from the bracket to the wall outlet and makes for a neater  tangle free installation   second  and this is a quibble  the enclosed mounting screws and wall anchors are pretty flimsy   i substituted a better pair i had sitting around in my toolbox     all in all  this product does what it is supposed to very well and  despite a couple of one time installation issues  i am very pleased with my purchase  i ve read the reviews and have to admit i really don t understand the ion thing but whatever it is  it sure seems to be working   my old dryer conked out so i decided to purchase this one   with my hair looking quite damaged recently i wanted a dryer that wouldn t make it worse  i changed shampoo at the same time so i m not sure which did it  but my hair looks so much healthier   i have fine  straight hair and lots of it and i m still finished drying in 5 6 minutes   much faster than before without the static and damage   love the setting controls  i use the warm  high setting and it leaves my hair really soft and healthy looking with no frizz  that alone is worth the modest investment in this product  i haven t used the attachments and don t think i will need to   a nice bonus but not something i require  i saw reports of sparks and singed hair and will be on the lookout for those things  but so far i m extremely pleased and may order a second one for my daughter   kudos revlon  abolutely love this  it hangs easily and is one of the best dryers we have owned  the best  hands down  my long  thick  naturally curly hair dries in 3 minutes and is flawless and straight  i use this in conjuction with the revo styler  resolve or lavei shampoo  i also use sleek look or sleeking conditioner  then i finish sparingly with my own version of ojon oil     even other andis blow dryers can t touch the performance of this one  neither can the other way more expensive blow dryers  i really liked the ionic technology   it dries hair a lot faster   however  after a year of owning this  it broke  i had to buy another dryer from amazon  and i chose a different one  the conair 213x infiniti professional tourmaline dryer   i noticed that the sound on the conair  when on high setting  was a lot quieter than the andis   i get the impression that the motor on the conair is of a higher quality than that of the andis  i love this dryer   it has improved the texture and whole condition of my hair   my  african american  hair is less frizzy  smoother and calmer   i m buying two more for my sisters as christmas presents  i try for the first time ionic hair dryer and i have to say  it works  the andis tourmaline hair dryer is better than i thought  makes my hair feel much much softer  the blowing is strong and faster than normal hair dryers do  so   trust it     worth it  i bought 2 more   1 to replace the bathrooms that was used by 4 girls constantly   and the other for our friends that loved the convience   for around 18 bucks these powerful dryers are tough  the one that died needed to be replaced after almost 2 years of hard work  remember there not just practicle but safer with kids  and the dim night light is a bonus   i am now thinking about selling these on the street    just kidding  trust me when i say you will enjoy  banb as far as the product goes  it is a fantastic hair dryer   it leaves my hair feeling soft and looking silky after blow drying it before i even do anything else to my hair   however  my gripe with this product is that amazon is not an authorized seller of the product and  thus  i cannot register the hair dryer   t3 actually told me i should send it back to amazon and refuse the credit card charges with my credit card company   fortunately for amazon  and unfortunately for me  i don t have the time or money to spend trying to resolve this issue   i just pray that my investment in this hair dryer  which i hope is authentic  will not be short lived   let the buyer  of this hair dryer from amazon  beware  excellent hair dryer for the money   drying time is cut by half  great tools included   my only wish is that it didn t weigh so much   it is a bit heavy but on the upside  by biceps are more sculpted now      so   you can save about  200 dollars for this model and have a heavier dryer or purchase a t3 which performs the same but is wayyy lighter  br    br   decisions   decisions        i have owned one of these for over 5 years and couldn t be more satisfied   i originally paid  40 00 and thought that was a high price  but after years of faultless performance  i d pay that price again   i m glad i don t have to because now the price has really come down   this small hairdryer has more air force than all the big clunky ones i ve used in the past   the telephone type cord is rugged and will stretch as far as 10 feet     excellant product in every category  i bought this wall mounted dryer to free up some space in the kids bathroom  and it works great  the nightlight is nice and bright and the dryer isn t too loud  the bracket mounted easily once i pounded the raised ground screw terminal flat  the bracket won t lay flat against the wall with the raised ground screw terminal on the bracket  the cord hook on the dryer mounted easily and works wonderfully  i ve only had it a couple of weeks  but everyone in the family really likes it  the conair blackbird is the best non professional hair dryer out there  multiple settings and 2000 watts make for fast drying without burning  great except that it s bulky  not good if you need to carry your hairdryer when traveling   i have owned this hair dryer since 2000  and i have enjoyed it thoroughly   this blowdryer is super quiet   i did not notice that it took any longer to dry my hair with this dryer versus my older 1875 watt dryer   i bought it primarily because it advertised the quiet motor       it is somewhat heavy  but once you get used to it  it is no big deal   i dropped this dryer probably a couple hundred times and it continued to work just fine       recently i noticed it was only blowing cold air and assumed that the heating element went out   i was going to throw it in the trash   lucky for me  i didn t get around to it   it is the perfect sleep soother for my now 8 month old daughter   it was just loud enough to break her crying spree and get her focused on sleep  plus  since the heating element went out  we don t have to worry about her us accidently touching a hot dryer   it is amazing  we turn it on and she immediately plops her head down on my chest and is out like a light in just a couple of minutes    wonderful  amazing on those rough days when nothing else seems to work       i enjoyed this hair dryer so much that i have just purchased two more   a back up for my daughter s restless episodes and one just for me  this is the first time i ve purchased a hair dryer on line   it seems that i ve had to replace my store purchased dryers annually if not sooner in the past   i m hoping this one is better built than the others i ve owned previously   it does seem to be a higher quality product        i have to confess that the color of this hair dryer was what initially caught my eye   it s a powerful dryer    certainly has shorten my hair drying time       i like this product a lot with one exception     the position of the buttons   they are situated at the middle of the handle   i end up accidentally shutting off the dryer constantly in the midst of drying my hair   not a big deal     just sort of irritating   had they moved the buttons higher up on the handle  this problem could have been eliminated  perhaps they ll make that adjustment on the next model     nonetheless  i think this product earns a 4 star  this dryer does dry may hair fast and it seems less frizzy than with other dryers  i have had many dryers ranging from cheap to very expensive  this one ranks in the top percent  a few downsides   it s a bit heavy and i don t like where the buttons are located  on off warm hot  i m constantly turning the dryer on warm when i want it hot  not the end of the world  just something i would change about it if i could  this is a cute hair dryer and my 2 year old daughter loves it because it s pink and has a kitty on it   would be nice if it had a cooler setting on it   my daughter cries sometimes because it s too hot   all in all  a good buy because the gimmick of a pink hair dryer got her to dry her hair with it when she wouldn t let me dry it with my hair dryer  i bought this product about 6 7 years ago at a local store and loved it   when it wore out i was so happy to find amazon had the identical item  i couldn t believe how fast it arrived and it works just as good as the first one   i really like having the wall mount design and it s simple to use  a great price for a wonderful product  i m amazed that people described this product as heavy  i find it incredibly light weight and cheap  i wasn t expecting much for the price  but even at the friday sale price this feels overpriced  i d be stunned if it held up any time at all  i have always loved using these great hair dryers at hotels and thought it would be great to have one att home  and it is   no more messes on the counter or sink  and you never have to wonder which drawer it is in    it s very good  it has two levels viz low and high  i wish if there was a medium level  works on both 110 and 220 volts ac  i ve been using this dryer regularly for 8 months now and it is a great deal for the money  the retractable cord and folding handle work fine  this is my first ionic ceramic hair dryer and i am not at all disappointed with this purchase  i love the jerdon 1600w wall hair dryer   this is the second one that i have and it works great  we were traveling and in one hotel my husband commented this wall mount hair dryer is great   next morning i ordered one from amazon   it arrived 3 days later and he is a happy man  this review is for the t3  overnight  dual voltage hair dryer   i have just used it overseas and i am thrilled that both the low and high settings work on the 240v setting  every other dual voltage hair dryer i ve had in the past only worked on the low setting overseas      this hair dryer is excellent because it is lightweight and dries my hair very quickly with much less frizz than ordinary hair dryers  i also purchased the t3 tourmaline diffuser and love it because i have naturally wavy hair and it leaves my hair with nice waves  much less frizz and it does not feel crunchy and dry at the ends   just nice soft waves   i can t say that it leaves my hair completely frizz free but definitely softer   i would highly recommend this hair dryer  i was skeptical about the ceramic disk ion feature  that it would actually reduce the static electricity  fly aways   frizzies and make my hair shinier and more manageable   how could a thing that blows air do all that    i knew i needed to look for something new though because after using my old blow dryer  my medium thick  wavy  frizzy fly away hair was not presenting itself in a pretty way but just looking worse and worse   any grade of shampoo and conditioner didn t seem to make a big difference overall     it got to be where i just dreaded the task of doing my hair     after using this conair dryer one time  my crown of glory was good enough to go as is if i didn t have time to use the flat iron   this is a 100  improvement over my old no special features blow dryer which has been retired to probably dry pets and mittens and boots or whatever   now after using this conair almost daily for about a month  i wish i had learned about the technology way sooner and saved myself a lot of angst over how to tame my hair    i love this blow dryer and that it came with three attachments  i don t know which i like best   that it is light weight  has a sufficient length cord  dries my hair quickly  isn t overly loud  and most of all that i can see that my hair is in better condition  this dryer is most definetely worth the money   i have naturaly curly frizzy hair   this dryer gives me soft  smooth hair in less time   the dryer is less weight and less noisy than all of the others i have tried   this dryer is the best   i would say it s a three pont five instead of a three  as long as you sit in the right chair and use the right table  it s not too bad  and have plenty to do  i got this to free my hands for other things sometimes  and i m going to use it more now that it s recommended over hand held dryers because it s less damaging to hair  i just have my hair down instead of rollers for faster drying  but going to start wrapping my hair so it won t be as frizzy  it takes about an hour to dry my hair  i m sure it would be about the same if i used an 1875 wattage one  i would recommend it if you have the patience to sit under a dryer and have things to occupy your time with  i highly recommend this hair dryer   i have very thick hair with slight wave  and for years i d let it air dry just to avoid the excessive blowdrying time required and damage that ensued   my mother in law has this model at her summer cottage  so i d use it when we were there   typically  one doesn t put as much effort into vacation hairstyling  but despite that  my hair always turned out better while away than when at home   though it s quiet to the point that i hadn t expected much power from it  i was pleasantly surprised to find it very efficient   it dries very fast  doesn t scorch your head  and adds a healthy shine  too   i m replacing my current hair dryer with this model   i was hoping to make a trade with my mother in law  but she won t give it up  i already own 3 different hair dryers from this brand  love them and will never go for anything less than that quality  i was looking for a new hair dryer b c mine did not have the concetrator attachment and the universal wouldn t fit   so i found this one and it had a great price and had pretty good reviews on other websites but a great price here   i got a great deal with the flat iron as well   it s perfect   it drys my hair much quicker and my hair feels softer and looks better than it did with just the regular hair dryer   i would absolutely recommend this item  this hair dryer was recommended to me by a coworker after i commented on how nice her hair looks  sturdy construction  retractable cord  great price  and my hair looks much better with this blow dryer than others in the same price range  the dryer worked great  heavier than i m used to   i followed the directions when retracting the cord the first time  to hold the plug end in one hand and push the retraction button with the other   but the button wouldn t press down easily  so i let go of the plug end to use 2 fingers to press the button  and cautiously turned my head away just in case    but the plug end whipped around and clobbered me in the face anyways  so watch that feature  this dryer was easy to install  i like the size and style  it looks great in my kid s bathroom  i would give it 5 stars if it weren t so loud  my kid s are startled each time i turn on the dryer  even with previous warning   it does dry their hair quickly  so it definetly does the job  i was actually giddy the first time i used this because of how it made my hair so smooth and full of body   this baby plus a little mousse work wonders   my hair is fine and not extremely thick  and this dryer does a great job of giving me extra volume when i want a more glamourous look   i feel it was worth the splurge  although i m glad i bought it when i did  a few months ago  because the price has since gone up on it  small and powerful   it dries my hair as fast as my full sized dryer and doesn t take up nearly as much space   also  my hair  which is prone to fuzziness when blown dry  doesn t come out fuzzy  tacks onto the wall very nicely   it comes with double sided thick tape and places for screws   i used the tape and haven t had any problems in over month     i saw these in hotels all the time and loved the convenience   now i don t have to deal with dragging it out of the closet every morning   it s right there hanging next to the mirror     i found it to be plenty powerful  and not too hot   the lower setting is good if you don t want to disturb someone who is sleeping   the high setting is powerful and loud  the product was exactly as described and works great   we placed it in our guest bath and not only do they have a hair dryer  but a night light as well   thanks  searched for this dryer after trying it in a hotel and loving how great my hair looked   still happy with the way it dries my hair  but have found the same problem others have with the retractable cord   it worked great for a month and now will not retract   a bit of a nuisance that spoils overall satisfaction  but still worth buying  i would have given this a better rating  because the dryer performs just fine  i especially like the variable speeds and heat settings      caution  be careful when pushing the cord retraction button as it will fly wildly about causing a risk of getting socked in the face with the oversized safey plug  a bit old fashioned  but i ve had one around for years   they work for me  i don t know if my product is defective  i just got it in the mail   but it is not what i would call a hair dryer   it doesn t generate much of a wind and it doesn t get very warm   i would not even consider this something worthy of packing to go on a trip   i m going to send it back and keep my nice hair dryer which is just a little bit bigger  i have fine  wavy  fly away hair that is prone to bushing and frizzing even in non humid weather and until i found this dryer nothing could smooth  straighten and calm down this wild animal on my head     this dryer is like a miracle   even in hot  humid weather i can walk outside and not feel my hair shrivel and kink up   ok  there will be a little frizz  but not anywhere near as much as before   i m telling you  if this dryer can work this well on my hair it can work for anyone   i ve tried other expensive dryers that women rave about and they were all a waste of money compared to this one     first of all  let me warn you that if you are expecting this dryer to be anything like your old dryer you are going to be let down   in just about every way this dryer makes you think it s not up to the task but if you give it a chance you ll see that it is light years better than anything else out there     for instance  this dryer does not seem to put out a lot of air   people tend to think it doesn t have enough power but that s not because it isn t working  it s because it doesn t need to blow your hair to smithereens in order to dry it quickly and thoroughly   and the benefits from not having to deal with all that wind are amazing   it actually gives you better control over your hairstyle and doesn t poof up your hair   if you curl your hair around a barrel brush and pull it tight  then pull verrry slowly down to the ends while following it with the dryer  it will dry your hair far more efficiently and smoothly than if you had to deal with tons of wind blowing your hair all over the place   the only thing is that it takes some getting used to the lack of wind because you are forced to handle your hair differently   once you get the knack of it  though  you will never want to go back to your old dryer again   i feel so much less stressed out using this dryer  too   it s quieter  lighter and doesn t require gymnastics to achieve amazing results     another thing is thatthe dryer is amazingly light   it weighs just over half a pound   again  the control this affords you in being able to hold the dryer at strange angles indefinitely without feeling awkward or tired is amazing   i used to think that only a professional could dry the hair on the back of my head and style it well  but now i can do it myself to perfection with this dryer   this dryer is so easy to use you will have more energy when you leave the bathroom   i ll swear it takes less time to dry my hair  although i haven t estimated by how much   it feels like it takes about 25  less time than my old dryer  which was also a professional ionic ceramic dryer      one thing that is strange about this dryer  but not in a bad way  is that at first i thought i was seeing smoke rising from my hair when i used it   this alarmed me because i thought i was damaging my hair   now i realize that this is most likely the humidity being blown out of my via the miracle of modern science   it has no smell and it seems like water vapor   i had seen this effect a bit with my old dryer  but it happens a lot with this dryer   all i know is that my hair comes out silky  smooth  and since i ve been using it  in much better condition than before   i sometimes feel like i ve used a relaxer on my hair     the only complaint i have about this dryer is a small one and quite minor in the scheme of things   the control buttons are in an awkward place on the grip of the handle and it is easy to accidentally turn the dryer off or change the speed or temperature   there are 2 independent speed controls and 3 temperature controls     other than that  i find the lower speed virtually unecessary because the higher speed is versatile enough to use for any purpose     in general  i would highly recommend this dryer to anyone regardless of their hair issues   i often see women with thick curly hair act as if their hair type is the hardest to handle and if a dryer can work on them it can work on anyone   well  they never had fine  fly away  kinky  curly  bushy  virtually weightless hair that will not be tamed for love or money like i do  so i often wonder just who has it harder in that department   but regardless of that  i think that anyone who wants silkier  smoother  straighter hair will be more than happy with their results with this dryer   personally  when i have seen bad reviews of this dryer i think it s because the person hasn t learned how to use it yet and is expecting it to act like the average hair dryer   if you have that reaction i would suggest taking some lessons in blow drying techniques because i am pretty sure that will solve your problem   this dryer has taught me so much about how to dry my hair successfully that i am almost in debt to it for an education as well   now if they can only come out with a model that will shine shoes too          update may  2008   i have now owned this blow dryer for about a year and despite daily use it s still going strong with absolutely no issues whatsoever and i am still thrilled with its performance  if you depend on a hair dryer to style  and you are going overseas  this product is a must   compact  rather powerful  and has a dual voltage feature   definitely well worth it  and very affordable too  this hair dryer was awesome until it broke after only about a year of use  still a pretty good price  but i won t buy the same item for fear that it will break again  having recently broken my wrist and also having hand function issues  this is the perfect dryer for me  i also loved the price and it is supposed to be a high quality dryer that should last for years  so what else could you want  i have never used more than high and never use those cool shots or ionic type dryers  this fits my needs perfectly  love it  i have been using the hair dryer for almost a month   it works great and has nice features like the cool air blast and the night light   to me  it is a lot quieter than my old dryer  and mounting it on the wall only took a few minutes  the night light is perfect for the size of bathroom it is in   if the motor lasts longer than 3 mos   which is all my jerdon dryer lasted   this is an excellent product     the andis 33805 micro turbo 1600w dual voltage hair dryer is a great little personal grooming appliance   it has two settings  low and high   i use high almost exclusively  even though i have fine  short  grey hair because i don t like to dawdle over grooming in the morning   its dual voltage selections  125v 250v  would come in handy if travelling  with an added plug adapter    high produces a rapid stream of air that quickly heats up and stays at a steady  moderately high temperature   low is appropriate if you spend more time styling with some degree of heat  producing a nice smooth and fuller result   however  i m a type a character who wants the job done pronto  so this is my machine of choice   all dryers sound a little loud right in your own ear  but a family member says that the andis is quieter than the sunbeam i recently replaced  br    br   i bought this device to replace a sunbeam compact dryer  which replaced another sunbeam  which was preceded by at least two conairs  and a parade of various compact  mostly  dryers over the last 32 years   this is the best of the lot   i actually gambled and bought two at once because compact dryers are getting hard to find now  and my confidence has been rewarded  br    br   if you are looking for a quick solution to get going in the morning after your shower  look no further   this one s a winner  this is the nicest hair dryer we have ever owned   br   this is number 3 we have purchased over the last 10 years   br   the first cost  90 00 and had no night light    br   now we buy the ones with the led night light uses little to no electricity  the dyrer is wonderfull  we bought it because the hotel we stayed in florida had them and thought what a great idea  no more wires or the unit on the counter  we also thought it must be good for everday use by different types of people  we really love it   br   it will go into our new 2 baths so i will be buying two more soon  night light went out after 2 months   i found out the warranty was only for 1 month      this is a good product but the warranty sucks   br   i am going for a full refund through american express   not through amazon  lost in the woods    i was looking for a simple wall mountable hair dryer  just like the ones found in a typical hotel room   this fit the bill perfectly   good enough for my simple needs   it s worked fine with no problems at all  i have a very old conair prostyle 1600   my favorite hand held dryer  and after over 10 years  it s been on its way out   i ve tryed various dryers  but none of them have the great feel of my old conair   i just recently ordered the conair yellowbird 1875   thought it would be great   looked just like my old one  only yellow   i tried it once and sent it back   it was too heavy  unlike the conair 1600  which was oh so light   and surprisingly didn t have the blow power i expected   so i read one review on the andis pro style 1600 and it sounded good   i tried it this morning and it s perfect   very light   and so small  i couldn t believe it   i travel on business and have not found a travel dryer i m happy with  so i m going to order another of these for a travel dryer  it works  the cord feature is great  the price is right  what else is there to say  i love my andis ionic ceramic hair dryer  i throw it in my travel bag  it has all the power of a bigger  heavier dryer     i love the retracting cord and folding feature  it stores neatly at home as well   awesome product  i travel quite often to beach resorts  i needed a dual voltage 220v hair dryer  not more than 1600 watts    this hair dryer works very well   i will buy soon an adapter plug  usa to europe    this is the best blow dryer i ever had  i picked this model because it didn t have the goofy nightlight and it is the same one they have installed at the local healthclub   the quality seems on par with ones i ve used in hotels  but it is loud on the highest setting   my wife thought it had too much force with the nozzle on the front but you can take it off with a quarter turn   comes with those standard plastic inserts for drywall  but i used they kind that look like a big spiral that you twist right into the drwyall with a screwdriver   it s pretty easy to mount with the included template or just use the metal backplate to mark the wall   shipped in a no frills plain brown box  so i would imagine that it is marketed to hotels and installers that order them in bulk  this dryer is the perfect size for travel and its performance is outstanding  this is a replacement for the same model hair dryer   the first one lasted over 6 yrs   i like the convenience of having it mounted on the wall rather than taking space on the counter   i could not find one in the local stores and found the best price on amazon com great hair dryer  i tried it in on of hotels  liked a lot and bought 5 for each room in the apartment  powerful  nice grip  light and not too noisy  great price  too  this hair dryer is identical to the one used by my stylist   and i paid the exact same price he did  i have some natural wave to my hair and while the dryer doesn t straighten every hair on my head  it does a better job than a regular dryer does  my hair tends to retain water  but i would say drying time is less than five minutes with this dryer  my hair is shoulder length   at my last cut  my stylist remarked that my hair is in good condition    about a month after i d been using the dryer  the dryer does get hot  but not to the degree my other dryers have  granted  i don t have a warranty with it  but i m very happy with this appliance  previously i had farberware 1500w wall mounted hair dryer   i was very happy with it even though andis is 1600w still it feels little less powerful   all plastic doesn t look very durable handle is small   stumpy   br   otherwise it is o k  night light is a good feature  i like the hair dryer  but i don t like the fact that the bonnet doesn t stay puffed up with air as it dries your hair  the high choice of hot air does not give off extremely hot air as many dryers do  and this is a plus for me  i don t like to get scalded while i m drying my hair  this is a good product at a good price  i wish for more choices high medium low power and heat but it does a real good job and the night light has been a bonus for our guests i ve been using a super solano professional dryer for years but was burning my hair  so  after a lot of internet research  decided to try this model   this dryer does not push out as much air  but it is much lighter and quieter   which at first made me think it was not doing as good a job   to my surprise  it actually did a better job in the same amount of time   despite the heat  no burning occurred  and my slightly wavy hair was nice and straight  shiny and smooth   not really sure what ions or tourmaline do  but the results are solid  okay  maybe not exactly explode  but very close   after my 20  year old conair blow dryer was literally falling apart  but still working    i decided it was time to treat myself to a new blow dryer a couple of weeks ago   i have very thick  long  wavy hair that i usually let dry naturally after drying my bangs  maybe 5 minutes    yesterday i thought it would be nice to dry the whole mess and use the iron on it  something i may do once a month because of the time and effort it takes    i kick it up to the high setting and become aware of a hot smell after a couple of minutes  but think that since i don t use this setting very often  it s just using coils it doesn t usually use  wrong   soon it pops  hisses  and glows a nice yellow red color before shutting off   i then realize that even the grip is hot and that the snake of smoke coming out of the end of the blow dryer is a death knell for my brand new device   i hope that maybe it ll work again after cooling off  much to my husband s amusement who said that smell only comes with electronic death  but no  it s forever dead  i have used this product for 6 years  my hairdresser introduced me to it and i now use it at home  its great for mustache areas and eyebrows  it grabs the fine hairs and doesnt let go  i highly recommend this   i wholeheartedly agree with another reviewer that this product is awesome   it leaves my hair soft  shiny  sleek and smooth with not a trace of dryness or frizziness   pair it with the t3 tourmaline featherweight hairdryer and you ll have salon quality hair   highly recommend  this is an outstanding product   i was a bit hesitant to order it given some of the reviews  but when it was discounted on a friday sale  i figured i d give it a shot  so glad i did  br    br   to get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual  it clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir  why you would want to anyway is beyond me   why would anyone want to use stale water    if you don t leave water in it  it won t leak out on your counter  pretty simple equation there  br    br   i agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless  they don t fit into the holder anyway  so just toss them out  sure  try it  but i ll bet you ll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner  i e   a scraper type device   br    br   the water reservoir could be a bit bigger   an additional 20  bigger would be nice  but  it s very easy to fill even when the unit is running  keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half way point   simple and easy  and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact  br    br   sound level is very low compared with past waterpik units  no  it s not silent  but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver   in fact  it is less noise than my shaver  br    br   the auto retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat  again  a couple inches longer would be nice  but there s the compact size trade off again  br    br   in actual performance   wow   you will never believe that your teeth could get this clean  wonderful feeling  there is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch  i ve found setting the dial to the 5 6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort  br    br   good performance at a good price    can t ask for more than that  i was blown away when i first smelled this frangrance   it is truly unique  now  i m not a huge fan of pineapple  so when i was told that was part of the scent  i was leary  but it is extremely subtle and well balanced with the other components of this complicated perfume  i immediately bought a bottle and a tube of the lipgloss   which i love too    and am going to stock up on more   it s a limited edition   and it s totally worth the price  i gave this perfume 5 stars  because i ll buy more for myself  and i would reccomend it to any woman anywhere  none available  definitely worth the money  i have been using this for a couple of months and have had no problems with  was nervous the first time i washed it in the washing machine  but it came out like new  i am 63 and really wanted to try this  i swirled and tapped and noticed that the places on my face that are not lined turned out nice  but i wanted a little more coverage due to some spider veins and 2 age spots  so i put a second coat on and these lines under one eye really stood out  i didn t know i had them until i used this product  so i got some makeup remover and took off the bare minerals that was on top of the lines and they disappeared  on those  i put my regular liquid foundation  on the lines and all was well    br     i think you should have nearly perfect skin for this to work nicely  not pure lavender oil but it works well   it is not too greasy and it is very flexible in the way it can be used   you can use it in baths  after shower bath or in massages   better than advertised  this sunscreen is absolutely fantastic   i have tried everythin on the market   i have eczema  skin sensitivities  etc      though many were okay  all had some disadvantage until i found antheliosspf 40   i first tried it on a 2 week trip to a tropical beach   had absolutely no negative skin reactions to it at all   not only that  but i did not get even a hint of sunburn   while surrounded by people who were broiling red   it does take a few minutes to rub in  which you are supposed to do in any case in order to give any sunscreen time to work before you go out into the sun   it even worked perfectly on my face   caused no plugged pores or skin reactions   very highly recommended   i actually went to anastasia beverly hills  and had my brows shaped by katie  who did a great job  by the way  so  i bought this kit so that i could repeat the effect between visits  i don t live near beverly hills anymore  so this was a must  my brows were a little thin  and so i am growing them out a little  filling them in in the mean time is really helpful  i was worried that i wouldn t be able to recreate my perfect brows at home  but  this kit was soo easy to use  i just used the stencil  and the brow powder  and viola my brows looked great again  and most importantly  natural  sometimes i ve used brow products that looked unnatural  but this stuff is of great quality  i would definately recommend it  it may seem pricey  but it is worth it  and  if you ever get a chance to go to anastasia s salon  do so   you don t even have to go to anastasia herself  everyone walking out of there had great brows  this is wonderful  it is also a bit moisturizing  that is one or two steps up from non drying  at least you don t feel your lips tightening throught the day  they are comfortable  the trick is to pat it in  your lipstick or gloss will really stay  watch out for the one problem with all primers  they are beige  your lips aren t  i didn t like the look of glosses  because you are supposed to see the lip through them  you might want to put a bit of lipstick on before your gloss  but your lipsticks will absolutely be the color they are in the tube  no more problems with the ones that turn color on their own  you are free to pick out the color you like  and all lipsticks will look smoother than ever and stay on  and really truly  no feathering or bleeding  i don t even try the others any more  i do put it in my purse for after lunch  that is the only time during the day that i wear it off  for the rest of the day you may have to reapply lipstick mid morning or mid afternoon  depending on how much talking you have done  but the price of the primer is worth it 1  because it works and 2  your lipcolor is going to last a lot longer  i have yet to use it tanning  but the smell is very musky and strong   i was hoping for a sweeter scent   it seems to make my skin soft though  it s o much better than lotion     i ve been using lotions and going to tanning beds for a while  i decided to try this just because it was on sale and it turned out to be great    you have to follow directions to get expected results    and everytime you apply it you get better at it  i like to apply it right after a shower  use lotion before applying   great natural color  dries quick  no weird smell  doesn t turn pamls orange  doesn t tranfer to clothes i use organic root stimulator to freshen my scalp after a workout  good stuff  be careful not to overuse this product  it will cause buildup on your scalp if you use it too often  nothing fully replaces a vigorous scalp scrub in the shower  like its predecessor  this does make your lips a deeper color and a  teensy weensy bit plumper  but i ve been using it for 1 week now and have my doubts about  maxiderm s  collagen boosting effect   if my opinion changes  i ll update the review but as of now  i d say save the 10 bucks and get original lip venom   okay     update   it works     after 2 weeks of two to three times a day application  my pout is definitely poutier   yay   also  i tested it on an 18 year old co worker  i am 30  and it had immediate results   hmmm  don t know why  but yes  great product  it works  i dropped my last full sized ionic hair dryer in the toilet  so i have been using the andis on a daily basis now   it works just as well or better and leaves my hair feeling silky and shiny   i highly recommend it  if for nothing other than the low price  dryer is very quiet and powerful  easy to install  night light has a nice green glow  highly recommend this product  none available  okay  i haven t owned a new hair dryer for over 25 years  but i must say  this one is exactly perfect and has everything i would ever want in a hair dryer   it has a retractible chord and is and dries my hair quickly  leaving it soft and frizz free   i highly recommend this product  after having read the majority of the reviews here  i m happy to report that this dryer is fast and very lightweight   my hairdresser who uses this dryer daily had recommended it to me awhile back  unfortunately  i bought back then what i thought was a better more economical option  an andis ionic hairdryer with a retractable cord and folding handle  while very light weight and space saving  i soon learned after several months of frequent use that either the cord was going to fray from from the retracting into the handle or worse  the handle could break from folding   well  it did   after the handle broke  i decided to purchase this hair dryer and i regret not having done so sooner   what a great hairdryer   very lightweight  dries hair quickly to a smooth satiny shine   i have straight  medium length  medium thickness hair that usually would take at least 45 minutes to dry   well  the t3 cut the drying time to 14 minutes and that s taking my time  the t3 dryer is also very quiet and despite having only 2 speeds and a cold shot button  does the job quite nicely and i don t miss having all of the other speeds   this was well worth the price and i wouldn t ordinarily spend this much on a hair dryer   but the results are well worth it   highly recommend  hair dryer worked good for about 1 year  then the switch broke  fused in the open position i would not buy an andis product again  i eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer about over a year ago because of it s retractable cord and folding capabilities  even the price was attractive  it really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus  i thought i had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly  now for the bad news   the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time  then  the folding handle  low and behold  broke in half one morning   of course  the warranty had long expired   this dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and i consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers  when i ve replaced hair dryers in the past  it was been because they ve simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out   i d caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone  while very appealing  can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer s lifespan   i ve now purchased a t3 tourmaline  a featherweight  quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle  which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan  i recieved this product yesterday and used it first thing this morning   i turned it on to high and the on air flow button broke   it is stuck on high and just slides up and down   i had to un plug it and re plug it into the outlet to use it this morning   this is made cheaply and is junk  do not spend your money on this dryer  i got this for christmas and i love it   it is very high powered for being a hello kitty hair dryer   i was surprised   it is very cute with a great price  this is exactly what i expected and works very good  worth the cost  i normally don t like to invest in hair products items that are this expensive  so i thought i would ask for it from my boyfriend on valentine s day  he bought me both the featherweight hair dryer and the wet and dry narrow flat iron from t3  i love both of them  the hair dryer dries my hair in about 6 minutes  when it is wet from the shower   i have asian hair so i can say that drying my hair isn t always a positive experience  however  if you dry your hair with the hot option first  doing the layers   then on the low option for the roots of your hair  and finishing with a blast of cool air all over  you will have shiny hair that is not poofy and is manageable    br   after using my t3 hair dryer  i don t know how i could not have it  now  i want to get the overnight dryer  however  here is a warning  do not expect miracles  if you have super frizzy hair or completely unmanageable hair  a hair dryer will not fix that  perhaps you should invest in some better shampoo  i recommend bumble and bumble or paul mitchell  and perhaps a hair treatment at the salon  this dryer is great for getting the job done quickly and to make your hair look better  without that frizzy  burned look that other hair dryers give you   my wife loves the hair dryer  and she is fussy about such appliances  and my little two year old loves the retracting cord   good dryer at a good price  the bonnet is nice and large and the air flow is just right for my hair   it has done a good job for me  i bought two of these  one for each upstairs bathroom  the arrived quickly and at first glance  i was intimidated about installation  then after reading the instructions  and seeing that they actually include a paper guide  you just tape to your wall and drill holes where the dots are    i installed both of these completely by myself   i am a stay at home mom  so that is a big deal   it took no time and they both were up  they brace very solid against the wall  the dryer worked quite well and was very quiet compared to our old dryer  it also has automatic shut off  you can even hang it up while it is on and it will shut off as it is put back into the cradle  very nice  i would buy again in a heartbeat  retractable cord doesn t always retract but i didn t buy it for that   br   very happy with the way it dries my hair  i really like this hair dryer   it dries quickly  not real noisy  and the retractable cord is a great convenience in my tiny bathroom  this dryer is absolutely wonderful   my hair has never been so straight  i wasn t in the market for a new hair dryer but  thanks to my husband  who deep sixed my old one using it to thaw frozen water pipes at our cabin  i needed a new one  he thought the dryer just needed to  rest  for a bit and then it would be  fine        so he didn t bother to tell me it had blown its last burst of air under our kitchen sink  i now needed to find a replacement hair dryer  something impossible to do on a holiday when all the stores are closed and you need to be somewhere in half an hour  br   fyi  if you  too  have a husband who has to thaw water pipes and has used your hair dryer  for that purpose  i suggest you point him in the direction of the   asin b00004ti25 milwaukee 6 dual temperature heat gun    if he takes the hint you can avoid having to go to a  very important family event  scaring small children  and some adults  i might add   looking like a demented survivor from a shipwreck  i still cannot fathom why steam coming out of my ears and fire from the burning coals in my eyes didn t dry my hair  where was a hot flash when i needed one  i m over it   or i will be as soon as all the pictures and negatives have been destroyed  however  i digress  so back to my review  br   i am glad i selected this hair dryer  it has proved to be an excellent choice  dries my hair much faster and seems to leave it silkier which is saying a lot since i have gray hair that has a mind of its own  oh  by the way  my hot tools hair dryer doesn t look too bad chained to the wall in our bathroom    mrs  b  this wall mounted hair dryer was the smallest one available  and that is why i selected it  it fits perfectly in a small space  and it is as inconspicuous as a wall mounted dryer could be  it works very well  too   it is quite powerful for such a petite dryer  i really love it  the initial reason for buying this hair dryer was to replace one that had died  my decision was based on price and product name and couldn t give a hoot about the ion feature  after a few weeks of use the woman who cuts my hair remarked that my hair felt smoother and was laying different  good to know that it wasn t my imagination  also  i found that the nozzle is a lot cooler than my old conair dryer  it s so cool in fact that i don t hesitate putting it away immediately after use  my wife just loves this hair dryer   so convenient   no more hauling the old one out from under the sink  unplugging the nite lite  etc   and the nite lite is great   those mid night visits are safe and lighted   no fumbling around with those other  soft lights   good dryer  very simple and has a nice combination of settings  drys hair very fast with no frizz   even in winter  liked the first one so much i bought a second  br    br   update  i thought it worth updating this review  as it has been nearly 5 years since i purchased two of these dryers  and they are still going strong with daily use  one of the things that i have come to really appreciate about this dryer is that the low fan setting truly is low  so many other dryers give you high and higher as choices  i don t want to achieve the head out the car window look  i want just enough airflow to get the job done  of course  there is a high setting if you do want more  the other noteworthy thing is that cleaning lint out of the dryer is so easy  the lint screen removes very easily and can be cleaned in seconds and replaced  this helps keep the unit working efficiently and adds to its life  so far this dryer is working great   another brand didn t last 1 year so i hope this one lasts longer  the first time out of the box trying the retractable cord  the button that retracts it got permantly stuck down  i am sure that this is a direct indication of the quality of andis products   be fore warned    light  dual setting  powerful  compact  an excellent product  very reliable  this is the second one i have owned the first lasted for eight years in home use and travelled the world  i was disappointed in this product as the bonnet was smaller than the previous dryer i was using by hot tools and had problem getting on over my large rollers   after using about 5 times it stopped working   i will say that it is compact for travelling but feel that it is undependable   the temperature did get extremely hot so for a quick dry it was good from that standpoint  i ended up purchasing another hot tools dryer  a little more money but worth the price in the long run  the hair dryer cord comes in handy  now i don t need to make sure the cord isn t touched by water  the hair dryer has a softer sound to it  so it doesn t disturb any one in the house  we have found the andis to be comperable to the dryers found in the more upscale hotels  the hang up cord is a great feature that helps keep cords organized  the night light gives plenty of light for finding your way around the bathroom at night  two speeds supply plenty of drying power  nice design  easy to mount  first saw this unit at our time share in aruba   it is very compact  lightweight and extremely powerful   it s works great  this is the second t3 i have purchased  the second was for a gift   it dries your hair fast   saves a lot of time   well worth the price this is the second andis hangup hair dryer we ve had     the first one was more than 10 yrs  old and ran great    we left it on the wall when we sold the house and moved    got a new one for the new house   couldn t be happier and love the night light feature    the product was here fast and it works great   i would use them again  this dryer is very light  very quiet  and does not burn my hair or dry it out   i can dry my semi long hair in about 6 minutes  using the cool shot button  and it is very smooth and shiny   i think it has helped calm the fly away static electricity this winter  but not completely   until now  i ve bought inexpensive dryers that last about 3 months  i m hoping that this investment will last a bit longer   my only complaint is that the manufacturer will not warranty the dryer because i bought it through amazon  which is not a certified dealer   so  any problems will be heading right for amazon s customer service department  i have nothing but good review of this product   br   great product at a great price  after using the dryer  which i liked very much and did a quick job   i discovered that my hair was being ruined   it would break off in small 2 inch curved pieces   br     br   i stopped using it for a month and confirmed that was the problem because the lavatory was no longer filled with broken pieces of hair   br     br   i would like to return it and get my money back     br     br     br    i bought this item because i was going to europe for a month  i didn t want the hassle of using a voltage converter because you can only use one electric item at a time  unless you buy more than one converter kit  you do need a plug adaptor   these are relatively inexpensive   then you just switch the voltage  plug it in and it works great  i used it in switzerland  france and italy  when i came home to the states i just switched the voltage back and i now use it at home  it is small and takes up very little space in the suitcase  i would recommend it for anyone in need of a hair dryer traveling abroad  okay  long hair girls   dont cut your hair     br    br   i was seriously considering it  i had enough of the 30 min  drying time and then i figured why not try this blow dryer   wow  first time i bought something that was true to its claim  took me 10 min  to dry my hair instead of the usual 30 min   not kidding   best investment you can make and really is lightweight  i bought this hair dryer for a rental condo in a chic downtown community and it fits right in   an excellent product  it is very efficient  and  packable  just what i needed for travel and days i need a fast set  highly recommended  i recently got to try this hair dryer in a marriott hotel and was pleasantly surprised  at home i had the sharper image 1875w quiet ionic hair dryer and this is what i am comparing it to  i went thru two of the sharper images ones  first one broke  which are much more expensive and my biggest complaint always was that it scorched my head  br    br   problems gone since i bought this  it is an awesome hair dryer  it lays in your hands comfortably  is sturdy and stores away in a breeze as it folds in the middle  plus you can retract the cord  on top of that it does not scorch or burn your head and also has the cool air feature  same as the sharper image  and my hair comes out nice  soft and never frizzy  at a price between  18 and  22 this is the hair dryer to buy  i did  and only wish i had known about this hair dryer earlier  i highly recommend it  br    br   update on 9 26 2009  almost 3 years later we re still on the same hair dryer  the cord needs a little help to retract but nothing has given up on it yet  it has been dropped a few times too  for the price that is excellent and we have purchased a second unit for our other bathroom  much better than the sharper image version which is way more expensive  scorches your head and won t last long  br    br   update 06 30 2016  the hair dryer is still going strong  cable retracting mechanism is broken now but that was not why we bought it in the first place  almost 10 years  not bad at all  plenty of power  plenty of heat  like the night light  but would like to be able to switch it off if i wanted     but can t do that  if i kept this near my ears for a long time  the noise would be an issue  but since i don t  it isn t  just a nice little device  bought this hairdryer for my daughter who ownes everything in pink   she loves it   it is light and has good airflow    she also pointed out that it is not very noisy and of course  the color is just right   br     br    i am enjoying my new remington hair dryer   it has been a good choice  i believe   i especially like the long power cord   it s also very good not to get tangled   my only complaint  if you want to call it that  is that i had expected that the hair dryer would be quieter than it is   i checked around before i purchased it  and one of the selling points is that it is supposed to operate more quiet than your average hair dryer  but i can t really hear much of a difference  if any   regardless  i am enjoying it  i very much like the way my hair comes out with this hairdryer   less frizz and dries quickly   the only thing i don t like is the heaviness of the dryer   it is three times heavier than my last hair dryer and after a while my arm gets tired   if light weight is important to you  don t buy this one   also  i thought the price was pretty good  but i have actually seen similar dryers cheaper at costco  a dryer that meets all your styling needs   it s not often that you can find one that is suited for both curly and straight styles   the air diffusing attachment is perfect for creating soft  frizz free curls while the concentrator nozzle  more narrow and therefore a better conductor of air than most models with this feature  allows you to direct air exactly where you want it   the dryer itself features two speed  low and high  and three heat settings  cool  warm and hot   as well as a cold shot button to lock in style   for the highest heat setting  simply put the dryer on high speed and the hottest setting  careful  though   this is only recommended for hair that s uber curly  like mine    additionally  the 9 foot long cord  complete with a loop that will allow you to hook it onto something in your bathroom or wherever else you store it  makes it really easy to use   another bonus  even on the highest setting  the dryer is considerably more quiet than other ones on the market that are similarly priced  you can easily hold a conversation while speaking in a normal tone of voice    br     br   according to the information that s included with the product  the dryer is made with a combination pink tourmaline ceramic technology that allows for a special emission of ions  these are important for eliminating static electricity    i found that after use  my hair actually was a lot smoother even than when i used previous hair dryers with ionic technology  i used it to style my hair both in its naturally curly state and after setting it in rollers to blow dry it straight   if your hair is really curly like mine  however  you might still want to use a flatiron to get that pin straight look   but for less curly hair or hair that s less prone to frizz  that probably won t be necessary   br     br   although this is by far my favorite hair dryer i ve ever owned  i do agree with the previous comment on this product  it really would be the perfect dryer if it had a folding handle   but this is only a tiny flaw  as it more than makes up for that missing feature with its humidity resisting technology   well done  remington   an invaluable product for any styling arsenal  this hair dryer is the same or similar to units we have used in hotels when we have traveled  it is compact but powerful  the extra feature of a night light is very nice for our home use  we have one in our master bath and our guest bath and would recommend this item to friends  its too hot on the hot setting and too cold on the warm  try not keeping it too long on your hair when its on the hot setting   br     br   good luck i am happy with my purchase of this hair dryer  although i do not really notice much of a difference that it is an ionic dryer   the look is modern   it appears to be a quality product  i just bought this and opened it up   i thought it would be good as i have fine long hair   br     br   i used it for about 10 minutes and something popped and it sounded different   i looked inside and it was red hot and started smoking   it may have spit out sparks as i felt something hit my head   i thought  this thing is going to light my head on fire   br     br   it is brand new and it won t work     br   everytime i turn it on it starts to heat up and smokes   br     br   i have a wonderful revlon hair dryer that works great  so i thought it would be good   the one i have isn t ionic and wanted to try it  guess i ll go back to the old one   br     br   don t buy it  great dryer  drys hair quickly and leaves hair soft with out the frizzies   br   great price shipped quickly with no shipping charges i bought this hair dryer to replace one that is so loud  it s making me deaf   on high setting  the 1069s is not quiet  but it is quieter than my previous one   the low hum of the motor also make it more bearable   more importantly  the high hot setting does not produce the type of heat the can burn the scalp if left in one place too long   yet  it still dries my hair like my old one   i d give it a 5 star if it was quieter like it s advertized  it s cheap  small  doing job  enough power   it may be good for trip  but the hotel i stay usually has a dryer  so i don t bring it  if you look for a compact dryer  then this is a perfect model as that price  i have used three of these   the first two each lasted a year before shorting out   i kept buying them because i liked the cordkeeper function   this last one  though  shorted out and started a fire   i have notified the company and will see what happens   but i doubt that i will purchase another   it s obvious that this product has an engineering or manufacturing flaw and should be pulled off the market  i looked at local retail stores and couldn t find wall mount units   don t know why anyone would want one just lying on the counter   i was skeptical of the ionic feature  but i believe my hair feels softer and less straw like after using this dryer   feels well made and should last   at first i thought the high speed wasn t powerful enough  but i think the quietness of this unit is deceptive   it s really blowing as much air as my old dryer  which was good  but it s so much quieter that you think it s not as powerful   the night light is quite bright and is a pleasing green  but i wish i could turn it off during the daytime  a colleague bought one of these and raved about it   i borrowed it so my wife could try  yes  it is lightweight    but so are most  20 hairdryers   wife said it didn t dry any faster  didn t impress her as being anything special   someone is laughing hard all the way to the bank with this  i had wanted a hair dryer for xmas which i got  i was so happy that way i didn t have to be under a hooded hair dryer  well every time i have used it and it s not many  i put the hair dryer on medium heat and it will be okay for a couple of minutes  5 minutes and automatically shut off  what the hell  now i have curlers in my hair and this thing decides to shut off when it feels like  this is going straight back to the store  this is the worst hair dryer    br                       signed wet hair  pros     br   1  this blow dryer is great for the price   just don t expect a  100  ionic dryer   you get a nice  18 dryer for  18   simple   br   2  nice looking  sleek design  with retractable cord   this is not a compact dryer for travel   it should be considered more of a mid size   br     br   cons   br   1   retractable cord is quite short  which could be a problem if your outlet is not very close by     br   2   very loud   i saw others complain about this  and now i know what they mean   it s loud    br   3   the retractable cord failed to retract after a couple of uses   this is disappointing considering it was a major factor in my purchase   br     br   bottom line   br   does it dry hair quickly and make it smooth and silky    no more than any other dryer   it s a nice  inexpensive  blow dryer  but i personally would not purchase it again   br    i was going to order a t3 from amazon but after reading the reviews that the manufacturer would not honor the warranty i ordered a bio ionic whisper light from amazon for  173   works great and because my wife and daughter fight over it i bought another one   it has a 5 year warranty that will be honored   if t3 wants to loose out on amazon sales by being jerks about the warranty  let them  very nice  sleek design   i just got it  haven t used it yet but the design itself makes it one of the best ones out there  if not the best   the only thing that it is missing  a folding handle  first of all   let me be clear that the materials used in this dryer are not first quality    on the other hand the design is extraordinary       i use mine on a daily basis and   provided you use them with  extra  care they will last more than a year      repairable       dont think about it  if you open the folding handle  it will break apart in your hands       i believe its components are so cheap that they do not resist being taken apart     this product has been  since the begining assembled in south america  just to seek the cheapest manufacturing process  the retractable cord is wonderful   the air power is good and it does a nice job drying your hair   as mentioned by others  it is heavy   the handle is also clumsy to hold  especially for someone with small hands    br     br   my main objection is that it is much too loud and for that reason alone i would not buy it again  i have very thick hair that s hard to dry   this blow dryer dries my hair quickly and i loved the retractable cord   it was a great blow dryer till it stopped working 3 months after i bought it    now what  good price for perfectly functioning hair dryer   ions seem to control frizziness somewhat ordered this product without reading other reviews first   wish i had because these ladies are dead on   the dryer cuts off as soon as it starts to get hot   don t waste your time or money   it s saturday   my hair is wet and set  and i m left without a dryer   i ve tried three times  twice on high and once on medium setting   i m sending this back right away   amazon don t let conair blame this on you   this model is defective  forget about the price  this hairdryer would be great at three times the price  light weight  quiet and all the options you need  good product   if you keep the setting on low it is pretty quiet  however once you kick it into that high gear  the noise level increases significantly   no complaints though  dries hair well  this item was shipped on time  easy to track and works great  been very pleased with this item i bought this dryer to replace my 10 year old conair  when it gets hot it would stop   good thing i didn t throw it away  this cordkeeper only worked for about 4 months   it is also very loud  almost hurt my ears to use it this is a good product  especially for the price   quite powerful  i like the folding handle and retractable cord and it doesn t eat my hair   my only complaint is it has shut off once or twice on its own   it came back on after a minute  but it makes me wonder about its longevity  it s good for the value  but bonnet pulls with the weight of the hose and drying time is not as fast as with an upright dryer  i have thick  not coarse  but not silky hair   i rarely blow dry my hair since it takes so long  maybe 7 10 minutes  with my old hair dryer  and i thought it made my hair coarser   i decided to give the ion thing a try though  and it was the best investment  in time  ever   it only takes  two or three minutes on high speed  medium heat to dry an entire head of shoulder length hair    i don t blow until it s bone dry  just dry to the touch    after the first time  my hair was super soft   after the second time  it got even softer and i thought it had more body too   i ve only had it a week  so we ll see how it holds up  but the ions really do work   i ll probably never air dry again  this hairdryer works exceptionally well  and dries my hair in about half the time  10 minutes    the only downside is that it is noticeably heavier than a regular dryer  well  i finally got tired of the clutter associated with my wife s hair dryer on the bathroom counter and started looking for wall mounted units   at the time  the jerdon 1600w had all good reviews and was one of the least expensive options   we liked its clean and symmetric design better than its competitors   anyhow  after 6 weeks of daily use  it still works fine  according to my wife   it has plenty of power and does have a switch on the handle for off low med high   if it is on when you try to hang it onto the wall base  it automatically flips the switch to the  off  position   most importantly  to me  the bathroom looks clean and uncluttered and i can use the countertop once again   the only thing that seems a little strange in my home bathroom  rather than a hotel  is that first class is printed on the handle  as can be seen in the photo   this is one of the best blow dryers i ve ever owned  it dries your hair quickly  and leaves it feeling soft not dried out  i almost didn t purchase it because of the price  but i m glad i did  you get what you pay for  and this is a great blow dryer  all in all  it s  a good little hair dryer   it doesn t blow as hot as my older dryers  but it dries my hair fast and with less sweating on my part    the retractable cord is kind of sluggish   doesn t retract all the way   but it s still an improvement over regular cords that were always getting tangled up with my curling iron cord  the folding handle definitely makes it easier to pack   i m not real sure if i notice much difference with frizz  maybe a little better  the only negative comment i can make is that it s very loud  this hair dryer worked well for a few weeks  and i was impressed with the speed i could dry my hair and the softness from the ionic stuff   however  after a few weeks of use it broke   it over heated and then the off switch wouldn t work  so whenever it was plugged in  it was on   very disappointed  as i was enjoying my new dryer  i purchased this dryer in july of 2005   on feb 1 of 2006 this dryer sent out sparks and the coils inside were red hot   i used this once a day almost every day   i will not be buying another jerdon hair dryer  this is a great little hair dryer   i have one in each bathroom   it is compact  powerfull and out of the way  i have used ionic hairdryers for the last couple of years  ionic dryers do dryer faster  and with less heat so they are easier on your hair  this was the first one i have seen with a retractable cord  which is what first attracted me   be careful not to pull the cord out to far or it doesn t retract well  br    br   over all this is a great little dryer  at a great price   i say two very enthusiastic thumbs up  seemed to work ok at first although i didn t notice much improvment in speed of drying  it is lightweight and easy to handle    but it is hotter than i m used to  after 6 months  my hair started to feel dry and had zero shine  my hair had always been very healthy and shiny before  my hair stylist noticed it and couldn t figure out what was wrong  after about 9 months  i switched back to my old hairdryer and my hair was instantly healthy and shiny again  maybe this hairdryer is good for some people but it was bad for me  and costly  i have been a long time user and fan of the conair cord keeper hairdryers   i use them until they just die   recently conair changed the look of this hairdryer and at first sight i thought that it felt much more flimsy than my previous cord keepers but did not give it much thought since i have always been very pleased with this hairdryer   the hairdryer lasted about 2 weeks before the folding handle cracked   when we opened up the handle we found that the plastic piece that makes the handle fold was cracked in half and did not appear repairable   i went out and purchased another cord keeper thinking that i just had a  lemon   well the second one lasted exactly 3 months and 1 day   today i pulled out the hairdryer  opened the handle and heard a crack   this handle is also broken which prevents the hairdryer from staying in the open position  the product does have a 2 yr warranty but you are required to ship the defective product to a conair service center along with  3 for shipping and handling   this would cost me more than the hairdryer  just not worth my time to box it up and take it to the post office  br    br   that being said  when this hairdryer worked it was wonderful   the two speed settings are the perfect speeds  the hairdryer is extremely light and the handle is easy to grip   the retractable cord is the best feature of this hairdryer and along with the folding handle it is great for travel  br    br   i did write to conair and their response will determine if i purchase another conair hairdryer plus i will be back to update this review  i bought this when my conair travel dryer finally gave up after nearly a decade   i purchased this specific dryer because of the retractable cord  and love it   the added benefit is that it dries my hair so quickly  but it was the cord feature that sold me   warning  as the previous reviewer mentioned  cats don t like this dryer   when the cord retracts it must sound like the retracting cord on my vacuum cleaner because my 13 year old cat flies off the bathroom counter as soon as i pull the cord to plug it in   otherwise  it s a great little dryer  i bought this dryer to replace another professional dryer i had   i was so surprised at how light and quiet it is   when i first opened the box  i didnt think it was going to work as well as it claimed because it felt like a toy  but  i am very pleased with the results   it dries my hair faster  my arm doesnt get tired because its so light  i can still hear my house phone ring because its so quiet  and it stays cool to the touch so you wont burn yourself  it will even straighten dry hair  for those mornings when you need a touch up   my whole curly haired family has tryed the tourmaline and loved it  i just got this dryer for christmas  and i absolutely love it   my hair has zero static  which is unusual during the winter   usually it takes about 15 minutes  at the minimum  to dry my hair  but with this dryer  it only took 5 minutes   i would buy this dryer for everyone i know  i was interested in the conair ion shine hairdryer as a means to keep my hair healthier  plus  my older conair dryer needed to be replaced  since i have owned the ion shine  in the last 6 months  i ve noticed that much more of my hair is breaking off near the scalp and i have a real problem with dryness and lack of body   i haven t changed any other hair products   the position of the ion switch is also a concern  i am a short lady so the weight of the dryer and the length of the barrel with the attachment is a problem as well  the dryer seems to run either too hot  or on warm is too cool to dry my fine hair in under 5 7 minutes  this is too long for me on work mornings  i used this hair dryer at my friends place and fell in love   i showed up at sephora expecting to pay  50 and saw that it was well over  200   i bit the bullet and purchased it anyway and it s worth every penny   my hair has never been softer or shinier   in fact  it s improved over just towel drying   yes  it dries faster and is lighter  but as a male this was a less critical issue   i really love how it leaves my hair soft  easily manageable  no static   and healthy   last week i bought one for my mom and more people are getting them for christmas  i have curly hair that i always blow dry straight  i have paid  300 for hairdryers bought in beauty supply stores   they were so heavy and loud  i was very skeptical to spend more money on yet another dryer  i am so glad i finally did   br   this dryer is magic  my drying time went from 45min to 15 no joke  my arm never hurts anymore and i am never getting too hot    br   i have 0 frizz and it really does make hair shinny  it looks a lot better after 15min now than it ever did with my old 45min drying time  i get compliments on my hair all the time     br   i rarely write reviews  but i had to get the word out on this exceptional dryer  buy it      when i first saw this model i was excited about the practicality of it s wall mount design  and the sleek styling it offered   it s 1600 watts supplied ample drying power  and the unit even has the ability to be shut off from the handset    a feature i am very fond of   the problem  they don t last   my first one lasted about 9 months and then began to continually overheat and shut off several times during my styling process   blowing into the back got old pretty quick  and in the hope that i just got that one lemon  i decided to order another   i ve owed my present unit for not quite a year now  and a few days ago i went to turn it on  and it just wouldn t   terminal   i find myself again in need of a new wall mounted hair dryer  dreading removing this one and remounting the next   i m presently seeking a better made model  after all  if you re going to mount something on your wall  you want it to last more than a year  no  love this hair dryer   my hair used to take forever to dry and this does the job in half the time if not less   my hair always feels nice and soft after i am finished drying it and is not frizzy   a huge improvement over my  20 hairdryer from target  great blowdryer    i bought this for my master bath since i was redecorating   lots of power and heat for a 1600 watt   the wall mount is absolutely terrific   feel like i m in a hotel bathroom       the night light is green and some may not like this but it fits in with my decor so i like it   can t wait to get another one when i re do main bathroom  i bought this hair dryer for my wife who told me that she read it was a really great hair dryer and she wanted one   well  i have used it twice myself and  yes  it really is a great hair dryer   she uses it to straighten her curly hair and it does a terrific job  making it soft and frizz free   in that i have curly hair also  i decided to try it and  was surprised when it also straightened my hair   we have purchased other expensive hair dryers and this one is far and away the best   i highly recommend it  i first saw this hair dryer on a tv show talking about beauty products used by the stars   then i noticed my hairdresser had switched to this brand   his observations were the same as mine   if you take a lot of time drying hair and the weight of the dryer is an issue  this is a very good purchase   but your hair will be no shinier or softer than with other dryers  owned one for years  paid twice this price for my old one  needed 2 more for second home  had to order one for a friend after she saw my old one  keeps dryer always accessable  never in the way since it has it s own place  ordered 3 this time  this is the only ceramic  ionic blow dryer with a retractable cord that i could find on the market and i am very pleased with it   my fiance loves it because the cord doesn t get tangled or clutter up the bathroom counter   i love it because it s a great size and performs well   drying hair very quickly   the only reason i hesitated from giving it 5 stars is that it is a bit heavy  because of the ceramic core  i suppose    lastly i think the product could be improved with a more ergonomic handle  received the product in very good time  price was quite attractive  there aren t many old fashioned bonnet hair dryers around anymore  this one replaces a decades old ge unit that developed severe rattles and then terminal switch failure   br     br   my wife really likes the compact size  relatively low noise  comfort of the product and storage of the tube and bonnet inside the unit s case  i d give the style designer a big attaboy  the unit is much easier to store away than the old one   br     br   the only negative comment was that she wishes the unit had one more lower heat option  she gets pretty warm even at low heat  however  she may be happier when our good old wisconsin winter setles in and the house is a little cooler  my 10 year old revlon drier still works  but has seen better days  i checked them all out and decided to stick with revlon because i love my old travel blowdryer  i was not disappointed  i ve had it for almost a month now and i love it  i have long  very thick  and sometimes unruly hair  i live in south florida  and this dryer works super fast and makes my hair look silky smooth  thanks revlon  unlike many other reviewers here  i have exceptionally thin hair   i purchased this dryer with the intent to improve the condition   it does a fair job  i have had the dryer about 2 years and it hold up rather well considering the abuse i give it   the dryer has very little power and i would say that drying time probably takes about 2 3 minutes longer than with a regular blow dryer   if you have very frizzy or curly hair then you i probably would not recommend this just based on the power levels   if you have wavy hair then this dryer in combination with either a diffuser or the accompanying attachment should would well for you   it is a heavier hair dryer and isn t great to take on vacations   the position of the ion switch is lousy   you ll probably find yourself accidentally turning it off just based on it s location   settings are either high or low and the same goes for speed   i happen to use high but if you like variety you may want to consider another model   a better buy is the revlon ion dryer if you feel like upgrading   the difference in price is perhaps 5 u s  dollars at best     i never knew how different a blow dryer could be until a friend of mine came over with this dryer and i could not believe how good my hair felt afterwards   i ended up buying the thing that night and threw that other conair one out    bought an extra travel one that week too  this blowdryer is simply the best  its cheap and it works so well  it feels like a bargain  i have less flyaways and my hair is shinier  my hair has never looked so good  i had no problems with the switches or the weight of the dryer  the size is not too big or small and its quiet  all in all it is the best blow dryer i had ever used  to my surprise  theres an ion switch  so you can have it on or off  great product  i bought this hair dryer a couple of months ago  and now it isn t even blowing hot air   i have bought conair hair dryers before and never will again  just because of my past two bad experiences   i didn t keep the receipt which is my own fault  but the dryer isn t even six months old and wasn t exactly the most inexpensive dryer in the store   it just turned me off when it quit working  as a child of the sixties  i still wear my hair long and i blow it dry every morning  when my old hartman protech 1600 hair dryer hit the bathroom floor  things weren t the same  eventually  in a spectacular pyrotechnic display  it breathed its last  br   since i had paid 20 bucks for it way back when  i was ready to spend that much on a replacement  much to my surprise  in the 10 or so years i d owned that dryer  a lot had changed  and now the same money buys a lot more hair dryer  so with some dough to spare  i bought one of these  br   many complain that it doesn t pack the same wallop as other dryers but that s a case of perception versus reality  the conair s barrel has a larger diameter than most dryers and its fan is quieter  so while the perceptible breeze isn t as blustery  it s still moving plenty of air  i know because i use an egg timer to count off 3 minutes while i dry my hair and the conair never leaves my hair damp  a barber told me that after 3 minutes of blow drying  you re just toasting your hair and not helping it   if you must have that scalp scorching pinpoint blast  conair includes a concentrator  br   ions are all the rage in hair dryer technology right now  purportedly  a stream of ions directed at your hair will neutralize static electricity and smooth out frizzy hair  ions are also claimed to flatten out scaly hair shafts  resulting in more shine  i m waiting for our good friends at consumer reports to weigh in on the benefits  or lack thereof  of dual ion ports  but after a week of daily use with the ion switch on  i ve noticed that my hair doesn t fight me as much when i brush it into place  even when the static charged santa ana winds are howling through sunny socal  my hair doesn t stick out like porcupine quills  and  yes  if i turn my head from side to side  there s a noticeable shimmer that either wasn t there before or i had never noticed it  br   a minor flaw is that the power and ion switches respond to a very light push  but after a couple uses you learn to position your hand accordingly after switching on the dryer  the dryer offers low and high air speed heat settings and has a cool shot button that cuts off the heater while cranking the fan up to its fastest speed  cool shot is another feature that is said to set a style in place by cooling down the hair quickly  br   so  whether ions really do or don t make a difference  the overall performance of the conair ion shine is worth the price ut after a couple uses you learn to position your hand accordingly after switching on the dryer  the dryer offers low and high air speed heat settings and has a cool shot button that cuts off the heater while cranking the fan up to its fastest speed  cool shot is another feature that is said to set a style in place by cooling down the hair quickly   br   so  whether ions really do or don t make a difference  the overall performance of the conair ion shine is worth the price  i just bought this dryer today after my other conair stopped working   it takes sooooooo long for me to dry my hair now   i can barely even feel it   it messes up my hair more than my other one did   as for helping my hair      yeah right   same ole frizzies as always   i m going to try and take it back  i looked at this hair dryer for two reasons   1  as a back up to my  100 hair dryer my salon sells and  2  something i could keep in my gym bag  i have long  naturally curly  thick hair that i like to wear very straight to the office  both my expensive hair dryer and this hair dryer get my hair straight and very smooth  the best method for achieving this was to use the highest heat and fastest setting on wet hair until the hair is damp  then to finish drying my hair with the air flow nozzle on low speed and medium heat while using a rollerbrush to hold the hair straight and curl the ends          i d highly recommend this hair dryer  one thing to note  i do not notice any difference when using the ion switch  depends on hair type    but with the multiple settings and the air flow nozzle  this is a great product  i ve had this hair dryer for six months and felt compelled to write because most commercial stores don t sell quality hair dryers like this one  i read these reviews and thought i had found a miracle product   i have medium thick hair  but it is long  and there is a lot of it   my hair is usually somewhat frizzy after blow drying   i have used the ion stylist for over a week now  and have not noticed a difference in drying time   i have noticed a slight difference in the texture of my hair after drying  but i think that is due to the cool function on the dryer  better than most   cool air is expended almost immediately   rather than the ion feature   the real test  however  will be this summer in the nyc  subways   humidity  can you actually love an appliance  b c this dryer is great  i have long thick wavy hair and with my old dryer it took 30 minutes to dry  with this dryer only 15 minutes    its so light weight my arm doesn t hurt  my hair is softer after one use  i used to hate drying my hair  now i look forward to it  if you are looking for a dryer just buy this one  its absolutely great it delivers everything it promises  you ll love it  i have very thick  curly hair and recently got a new  short style that i wanted to blow straight   i had an older dryer that just didn t cut it   so i did some research and purchased this one   i absolutely love it   it blows my hair straight very fast and all the frizz is gone too  i just bought this dryer so i have yet to use it  i just wanted to thank all the ladies for their reviews   it helped me choose this dryer  i have been using the conair 1875 translucent blue dryer for two years   i had to buy a new one each year why  good question  b c it stops working  i used it last night  and went to use it this monring and ah ha  it doesn t work  it didn t fall noone else uses it it just stoped  i was going to but the conair ion blowdryer but after reading all these reviews i said let me get away from conair  the dryer never did anything  and if you live in ny you know what the seasons are like here  i have long thick wavy hair that i dry straight  so i m hoping this dryer really does work i ll let you know  but again thanks to all the reviews they really helped in making my purchase    br powerful  multi speed  multi temperature  ionizer  what else could you wish  great   i just started using an ionic hairdryer recently after my cousin requested one as a christmas gift  i used hers once and i was hooked  my hair is long  mid back long  wavy and usually frizzy if i don t use straightening products or a blow dryer straightening hair attachment  it used to take me atleast half an hour to completely dry my hair straight on a regular dryer high setting  with the ionic dryer my hair  without any balms  gels or attachments  is super shiny  has lots of volume and dries in half that time and has gotten more straighter  there is an even better newer model conair ionshine dryer 1875 that has a more ergonomic handle with better settings and buttons  i would recommend this to all my friends and family  i have thick shoulder length hair  that usually takes 35   40 minutes to dry  with this dryer  i m done in 20 minutes and my hair looks smooth and soft   i was skeptical about the whole ionizing thing  but it has made a big difference with my hair   the removable br filter was the deciding factor   i ve thrown away dryers just because i couldn t clean them  excellent product  i just purchased this dryer  and i really like the way my hair looks  it does what it says  drys it in much shorter time  and a much healthier feel   my head isn t on fire  it doesn t seem like hair would dry as fast as it does   but it works  i love this dryer not only is it quiet  it really does make my hair shiny and silky   i bought this because i simply needed a dryer and thought if it could do anything else it would just be a bonus    i have straight hair which tends to be more shiney than layered  i liked how my hair felt particularly here where it can be extremely humid  i was pleasantly surprised   although another reviewer found the weight a problem  it was no heavier than my old dryer  i love it     this hairdryer far exceeded my expection for br volumizing and adding shine  br   i have limp and fine hair and had tried anything br from volumizing shampoo  hot curlers to mega hold br hair spray  nothing was ever so satisfying and lasting as br the results i got from this hair dryer   i br blow dry as i normally would and my hair looks br bouncy and shiny right away   and it stays br that way even overnight   i never thought br this was possible without going to a professional br salon  getting my hair stretched by large brushes and br baked under a blowdryer for 40 minutes  br and there is nothing better than stumbling upon an  br inexpensive product that does wonders  br highly recommended for fine hair  works great  works great  works great  love this dryer  love this dryer  i just got this last week  i think s great  the

nice hair dryer from remington  the handle and controls  are very ergonomic  and the head is well balanced so that it doesn t get to be a chore handling it  the heat settings are what you d expect  and the dryer does a good job of getting your hair dry fast without too much static buildup  what i really like about this dryer is the generous cord length and the ability to hand the dryer from a hook  the attachments fit well  but the diffuser attachment comes in the handiest as always  so far  an excellent hair dryer  not too noisy  good controls  the handle is well contoured  my only nit is that the little plastic attachment that directs the stream of warm or hot air pops off a little too easily  this item it s been working perfectly fine  i m glad i ordered   perfect perfect perfect perfect great dryer  great dryer  great dryer  small and strong   great dryer for travel   also has dual voltage   glad i bought it  seems to be working well  was easy to mount on the wall  i have

low so it s just fine for my needs  br   i tried a salonsalon hair dryer at a friends house which was fabulous   turns out it costs  169   way out of my budget  this one will probably last a year and then i ll probably buy another sassoon tourmaline ceramic   helps keep the fly aways from flying away  this is a great hair dryer with loads of power   it feels like a salon dryer  this is a great hair dryer with loads of power   it feels like a salon dryer  this is a great hair dryer with loads of power   it feels like a salon dryer  cute and stylish cute and stylish i bought this for my girl to keep her from buying another walmart bargain  i can tell it s quieter than most and she says it dries her hair faster  nice lightweight unit  ergonomically designed  the cleanable filter on the back is a nice feature  bang for the buck very good  good quality bang for the buck very good  good quality bang for the buck very good  good quality i love this hair dryer  the available speeds and temperatures are perfect and it s the most quiet hair dryer i ve ever owned   the only drawback for me is the placement of the on off switch  it s located at the very bottom of the handle so i have to use two hands to turn it on or off   a better design would be to reverse the placement of the buttons so it could be turned on off easily with my thumb  currently  the speed temperature button is easily reached with my thumb  but i don t change that very often   that is the only reason i didn t give it five stars   nevertheless  i still highly recommend it and would buy it again  my wife is very happy with this hair dryer and she has very full  thick hair  so far so good blow holes are only at the top would be great if they were at the sides good as expected nice quality  fairly quiet  nice looking and not too big   i bought two  very much worth it  best blow dryer i have purchased in a long time i love how compact it is and how amazing it works    i love how compact it is and how

that means   it won t make your hair shinier  healthier  or improve your already good looks   however  in real world day to day use it is very capable and effective at drying and styling  br    br   it feels solid and well built without being too hefty   it has very solid cord connectors and circuit breaker protection built into the plug   excellent safety features   the handle and controls are

definitely is not portable though it is transportable if weight is not an issue  br    br   hair dryers are a commodity and there are a lot of choices   this unit stands out in a crowded field and

review program  but this is a great hair dryer for a low price  it has 1875 watts  which is 25 more than most  and more ion presentation for quicker hair drying  ions are funny things ionized air respells water  and deionized water falls off easier  so if there was a way you could wash your hair in di water  you would really have it made  cleaner hair that dries very fast  but i digress  this

fact that the funnel tip does pop off too easily if bumped by a brush  excellent hairdryer  folds up nicely  haven t had the opportunity to test it on 240v yet  but i m sure it ll do just fine  turning the dial on the handle locks you out of putting it on the high setting whenever you re using it with 240v  which is a really user friendly addition   you re not suppose to use it on high with

girlfriend for her birthday last year because she is always complaining about getting her hair done and how much people charge her  which i end up paying for anyway  so i thought what better thing to

so happy because the vent on my old one was sucking my hair inside and i would have to break by hair to get it out  br    br   this hairdryer is very nice and durably constructed  it feels substantial in my hands  not flimsy and cheap  it comes with 2 diffuser type attachments that connects easily and stay in place until you take them off  br    br   the cord on this hairdryer is super long so i can move around quite a bit while drying my hair  there is also a loop built in the handle so this hair dryer can be hung up for storage purposes  br    br   the hairdryer itself has a cool shot button which you hold down if you want cool air to blow out  there is another button that changes the forcefulness of the air that is blowing out  this one has 2 settings   the last button is high  medium and low for the warmth of the heat that will blow out of the hair dryer  br    br   this hair dryer is 1875 watts so it is pretty powerful and it dries my hair pretty quickly  the infrared light actually is an orange red color and it helps to reduce static and frizz  br    br   i am very impressed with this hair dryer and i wish i would have gotten it sooner  br    br   i received this product free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review  used one in a hotel and replaced my huge home dryer  does a great job and meets all my expectations for heat and air  does a great job and

result  my wife is 101  pleased   really  fit and finish is as good as the chi  logical button placement and function is perfect  temps are ideal  force is great and the whole hairdryer feels like a salon professional  they could double the price and it would still be a steal  very well done  i like it so much  we are buying a second to stick on the shelf if the first ever gives up the ghost

my wife already had this one and has been using it for several years   so when my other brand hair dryer died  i bought this one and so far so good   i have been using it for about 3 months now  works great works great works great the best hair dryer i ever used   the best hair dryer i ever used   the best hair dryer i ever used   the best hair dryer i ever used   wonderful hair dryer and at a good price wonderful hair dryer and at a good price wonderful hair dryer and at a good price great hair dryer great hair dryer great hair dryer works great  works great  works great  for the price  this hair buyer is wonderful  my hair is seriously prone to being frizzy  and with  1  being tourmaline ceramic   2  having a warm setting as well as a cool and hot  and  3  having a concentrator  my hair has started acting much better  it s also fairly quiet  the lack of five stars is because it isn t particularly easy to store  it barely fits in the normal size drawer  and including the diffuser  concentrator  and a hairbrush  it can be challenging to fit it in the drawer  definitely a wonderful buy  though  excellent excellent excellent excellent i m profesional hairstylist and i love it  i m profesional hairstylist and i love it  i bought this hair dryer several years ago and really loved it  so when it stopped working recently due to a loose connection in the gfci plug i knew i had to purchase it again   the retractable cord is just brilliant    every hair dryer should have this feature   the cool shot button is handy to help set your style   and the diffuser attachment is just  fabulous   with air being directed in and through the prongs as well as around them to provide more even heat and air distribution   i am so glad conair is still making this model and that amazon carries it  powerful  it certainly works okay  but   br    br   it s very big  it s quite heavy and you ll need to have a good memory to remember all of the functions  br   i would say this one has been   34 over engineered  34  in the extreme and i m sure as i will  many will go back to their lighter and simpler to use unit  br   a speed  cool and perhaps two or three heat settings are i m sure is what most of us need and want and i feel this baby has just got too many functions to be practical  br   luckily  i purchased this on a very special amazon deal  but truthfully i will just keep this one as a spare  handy little blowdryer  better than leaving one plugged in on vanity  not alot of power though has lots of power to dry hair quickly and it is great for travel  best hairdryer

down quickly when you are through using it   easy to regulate the temperature and the unit has great fit and finish   the one item worth noting is that the remington is about a quarter pound heavier than the babyliss which may be an issue if you use it for long periods of time   i highly recommend this hair dryer  very well made  ergonomics is perfect  it has a dust filter that you can remove and

son and he loves it and uses it every day   not too loud which is great  i have thick long hair that takes what it seems like hours to dry  so i had to see if this hair dryer  was as great as it says  and it is  my hair drying time got cut more than half of what it usually is  and my hair doesn t feel frizzy like it does most of the time  i never tried a iconic hair dryer before but i heard good things about it  so i am excited to have this one  and it s big but it is also light weighed  which makes it perfect  it comes with two attachments and i tell you when i tried both of them out  it felt good on my scalp  it was like a light massage  i am proudly leaving my honest opinion about this product that i have received  i got this for the wife  but have to say it s not noticeably lighter than the previous unit we had but it is very sharp looking  the controls are all conveniently placed with a plenty of speed and heat settings  the cord is of very good quality and pretty lengthy  i feel for the price it s a very good buy and would really recommend it  when i first received this product i was a little sketchy  as hair dryers normally make my hair super frizzy  br   this hair dryer is amazing  the diffuser works just as it should  my normally frizzy hair was smooth and flyaway free  which is attributed to the ionic technology  br   this dryer has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings  as well as a cool button  which is always good after a long time of use on your scalp  br   its very lightweight and easy to use  even a beginner  like myself  can get use out of this product  br   it has a nice cool blue tone on the front  which is good for me  br   all in all i d say this product is the best hair dryer i have used to date  would highly recommend to anyone  this conair works so much better than most blow dryers   it is a great color and had a great output   i was so very impressed with how much quality you get for the price   the reason i am giving it 4 stars is because it is a little heavier  not cheap plastic at all  whoa   amazing what a difference this hair dryer makes   ive owned many  none that compare to this   no more uncontrollable or fly away

several times this week and i am super thrilled with it  the heat can be set to low  medium  or high depending on your preference  i really like that  because when the weather is hot  i don t always want to feel a hot breeze in my face  i prefer it to be medium or else i start sweating  my former blow dryer only had the hot setting  so this is a great advantage for me  also this hair dryer is great because it has a cool switch  a button you can press to get a quick shot of cool air occasionally  i love that it has a wind controlling cone that can be added to the dryer for styling  i like to use a round brush to make the ends of my hair curl under sometimes while blow drying      but i don t want my hair blowing every which way lol  so this is just perfect  i really truly love this

locking wheels when i bought it and it does not have it   girl friend is super happy how her hair comes out with this machine and that was the whole plan   also the pole is spring loaded which makes it easier to adjust up but harder er to adjust down but you don t have to be super strong to do it   it was easy for me just wanted to mention it because i thought it was a great selling point because if it wasn t spring loaded it would suck adjusting the height  good product  does the job well  good product  does the job well  good product  does the job well  good hair dryer  good hair dryer  good

very fast it s a great value for money  br   the hairdryer is very light  it doesn t heat up too much and works perfect  br   a little con is that it doesn t come with a diffuser  but for this price you can pass over it  this is exactly the hair dryer i wanted   light and comfortable enough to grip and operate with one hand while steadying a wet dog in the other   it produces the perfect temperature to dry doggy fur  and it s got an easy to use heat release button that s very handy if you worry you might be crisping your dog and want a moment of cooler air  i m sure it would be great for people  too  but i ve never tried it so can t comment on that  br    br   one bit of advice   the appliance comes with a safety feature on the cord   until certain steps are taken  the hair dryer won t work   don t try to figure it out on your own  just read the instructions that come in the box   once you ve followed them  you ll be able to turn on your appliance   it isn t necessary to do this every time  just the first time  and i m glad to have the extra safety feature  great item i will buy again great item i will buy again great item i will buy again i ve used this for a few years

powerful  and it dries my hair pretty quickly  i have thick hair      the only reasons i gave it 4 stars and not 5  the cord is a little short  but fine for in front of the mirror   it is slightly

do you need to know this dryer is quite loud  but i love that it is ionized and ceramic and light weight   i don t use a hair dryer much so it works well for me  4 stars because it is a great

will continue buying if anything ever happens to it  the color is much prettier here on amazon than in person   in person it is a much darker red  not as bright and shiny   the attachments go on hard and the finger diff user is just so large that it really can t be used effectively   the back cover comes off for easy cleaning and it does  nicely and the screen is easy to clean   the angle attachment works good   for the price  it is a good deal  br    br   still a great deal  love my hair dryer   i didn t use the diffuser  so i sold it on ebay and the hair dryer paid for itself

keep it on neutral ions for the most part  i haven t noticed a big difference between the 2 ion settings  but i wasn t expecting to anyway  it seems like a gimmick  i was more concerned with having multiple speeds and heat settings which this has  this dryer does not blow strong   we need to use the concentrator attachment for it to work at all well   the diffuser is a joke   you might as well blow on your own hair   i bought this to replace my 20 year old misty tone 1500   it is really not any better at all  this is a quick drying dryer  which is what we all want  lol   the retractable

ever had  it is really awesome this is why i gave it a 5  i would indeed tell others that this is the dryer to own  i have 2 other blow dryers  and i will be selling them   this dryer is without a doubt the best i have ever had  it is really awesome this is why i gave it a 5  i would indeed tell others that this is the dryer to own  this dryer is really fast and does a nice job of making my hair already pretty smooth before having to flatiron it  i used one of these at a marriott once  and thought it was a great little dryer  it folds up nicely and works great for my daily use at home  temperature and blowing options are perfect for me  i literally have no complaints  especially for a  20 product  the dryer does actually work  it has a inside setting to automatically shut itself off to prevent overheating  worked great from me without shutting off i like this because of the three speed settings and three heat settings   i just like having the options   i also like that the cord is fairly long   some are just too short and you have to stay so close to the outlet   i will say  though  if you like your dryer to get super hot this may not be the one for you   it does get really warm but not   34 burn your skin  34  hot like some of them   i m happy with it  this works great  was brand new in the box  i used all the time   i was very happy with this product this works great  was brand new in the box  i used all the time   i was very happy with this product powerful and has a really hot setting  a warm setting and button for   34 cool  34  which has no heat at all   it s very good and i m very pleased   my last conair of a similar model is still going strong after many years and we ve used to to defrost the freezer when it was broken for a few months  had to defrost it every week   and i used it as my own hairdryer and as a dog grooming dryer  which is now it s exclusive use  i have a dog grooming business    so these are workhorse machines  you kept telling me you were preparing it for shipment  and that i would get it on the estimated date   i did receive it on that date  but it would have been nice is you had promptly sent it out  i could have had it sooner   my old dryer quit working   so had to wait for you to prepare shipment  whatever that is    i like it more than the one i have   i wish it had 6 settings through low med high and cool warm hot  that would make it better  then i would love it  to be fair  i knew it didn t have all of those settings when i bought it  i have not gone to europe with it yet  i ll see if the electricity conversion truly works then  when i was staying at a four star hotel  a marriott i believe  this hair dryer was in the bathroom   i liked it   i made a note of the model number  and i ordered it from

hair like my last blow dryer  easy to store with retractable cord  it has a number of settings as well  great buy  got great rating from good morning america   the reason i bought it   doesn t fry my

br   i just love my purchase  i always end up as a happy customer  of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by amazon  great product  br   i just love my purchase  i always end up as a happy customer  of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by amazon  first discovered this at a hotel we were staying at and was impressed by the output so much that we ordered one before we checked out  i needed a replacement dryer   this does the job  it s super light  and cute looking   at first i didn t think i would like it because it seemed really lacking in power   however  it dries hair extremely quickly  so the lack of power isn t an issue  i used this while vacationing with a friend and it was the first thing i came home and bought   great power  easy to hold and store  i thought that hair dryers are just that   hair dryers  this is not your standard hair dryer   it can basically style your hair without applying any gel or styling products on your hair  it is that amazing  and it keeps the style of your hair for the rest of the day  i ve had this dryer for 2   years  the latch that keeps the hood upright has finally warped and doesn t stand open  otherwise  it heats nicely and evenly and the ion feature leaves my hair shiny  it was so good that i refuse to buy another  i just rigged it with some flexi rods to get the hood to stay open and upright  yep  it s just that good  this is the best travel dryer i have used  and i have bought many  only negative   it isn t dual voltage so it won t work in countries with 240 volt wiring  i only used it once but so far so good  very comfortable and easy to maneuver to multitask  great product  love my new dryer  much better that the ones i ve had before  i like that you can adjust the temperature  arrived quickly  works great and has all the features i need  amazing how cheap you can get a good hair dryer these days  great seller and product  arrived quickly  works great and has all the features i need  amazing

purchased the leopard print babyliss nano titanium portofino 6600 hair dryer   it definitely cuts the drying time for my hair   i am glad that the  cool  setting is indeed that  cool air  not just unheated air   my hair has appeared shinier with less frizz   i am very happy with this purchase  great dryer   i use attachment so my hair doesn t blow all over place  dries hair quick  looks good  hope it lasts forever  great dryer   i use attachment so my hair doesn t blow all over place  dries hair quick  looks good  hope it lasts forever  it is a little noisy  but works well with strong wind

for my hair and i use it after giving my poodle and maltese a bath  i highly recommend this blow dryer  will purchase again from this seller  this hair dryer very handily keeps the dryer out of the way and the is very conveniently located on the wall near my vanity  i tried this blow dryer at a hotel and loved it  i ordered it when i got home and was not disappointed  this blow dryer is powerful and does the job efficiently  i will never go back to a hair dryer that doesn t have a retractable cord  its amazing and so much more organized than they use to be  maybe i m late on this new technology but its great  hair dryer itself is amazing as well and does the job in minutes  all hair dryers should have just the   34 cool  34  air function   i like it  others like it the cool air is powerful and i think it does not make my hair fall off  get it  this works fabulous  dries my hair in 1 2 the time and works great for getting hair straight before using my hsi professional hair straightener  followed with hsi argan oil  worth every penny    pros  br    br   good amount of drying power considering how small it is br   perfect size for travel br   dual voltage works great  no explosions when i brought this dryer to europe  br    br   cons  br    br   plastic piece that changes the voltage has fallen out twice      br   when using in europe  the wind is very powerful    but that s good for me because my thick hair dries faster  br    br   bottom line  i do like everything about the dryer except for that darn plastic piece that falls out  if that we re not an issue  this would get 5 stars  this hair dryer is easy to use and has lots of power  the rubberized texture is easy to grip and hold  best  10 bucks spent  put in on my mirror  salon looking blowouts in minutes

sounds quiet and smooth  drys my hair quickly  love the retractable cord  i have used this dryer for many years and decided to purchase another one for travel   lightweight and a good airflow  i have used this dryer for many years and decided to purchase another one for travel   lightweight and a good airflow  i love this hair dryer   it is very quiet compared to many dryers i have had   it is awesome having so many heat and speed settings   it comes with attachments which is a plus but doesn t really need them  the retractible cord is very handy for storing in the drawer   i would definitely buy again  the only con i can find is that it is a little heavier them i am use it  i researched various black on wall hairdryers and i liked that this one was compact and a cord that seemed like it would stay out of the way  i mostly purchased this for when the girls are at the house and need a hairdryer  but it s actually come in handy for me as well  anyway  mount and forget this thing  the cord for how i mounted it does slop around on the counter top a bit  but you really need that to have a comfortable amount of distance to use it  br    br   anyway  i m very into more modern looking gadgets and the compactness of this and sleek black made it a great fit  after two years  it s still working great and gets a decent amount of use  no problems whatsoever  i use this every day and it is a good reliable product but the power switch has started to stick   i think that a shot of wd 40 would fix it  though   i have been using it for many years and like the product   i would buy another and recommend it highly to others  it worked fine on my trip to israel   it is easy to pack for travel and has a lot of power  i have had many blow dryers          then of course i needed another one  so br   instead of going to target again  i thought let me see whats out there     i love amazon so br   that was the first place i went to  i saw this blow dryer and read the

with this if you re looking for a professional grade dryer  wall mounted hair dryer is a space saver in the small bathroom  and for a condo that is also a vacation rental  this works very well  we won

does exactly what you need it to   my hair is about shoulder length and it dries it within about five minutes which is great  it can be loud on the higher setting but most hair dryers are  i recommend it  this drier is perfect for what i need   i can now dry my hair in 10 minutes by just sitting there  instead of 40 minutes with a hand held drier   it has a temperature control and a timer  but it does not have a switch to control the wind speed  as was listed in the description   the speed control switch was even on the diagram that came packaged with it  but it was not on the drier   despite this  i am keeping the product and am very happy with the results i am getting   one thing to note is that there is some assembly required for the stand  and there were no instructions included   i managed to put it together just using the diagram  but if this is not your strong point  enlist help  this drier is perfect for what i need   i can now dry my hair in 10 minutes by just sitting there

wife    so i m not the end user  but from my observation  this hair dryer was much quieter than her old one  it also did the job much faster  the only reason i can t give it five stars was that the documentation was very sparse  there are a couple of features that would benefit greatly if it came with a manual to explain it  i ended up having to google to find out what they do  br    br   overall  a very good product  my wife would recommend it  great product   dries hair much faster than previous less expensive dryers which stop working after a year   attachments weren t in box and

was smoke coming from the back of the unit and it stopped working  i contacted amazon and they are sending a replacement unit  it could be that the unit was defective and the replacement will last longer  but  my rating will stay as 1 star until we can proof otherwise  i did a lot of research  this is the narrowest one  the 2 speed 3 heat settings are great  very nice for a small space  it s great   it s kinda loud but a great product   would buy another  loved the red  the cord goes back up the dryer  loved that feature  does everything i need it to do  light and easy to use  i love  the

wife is happy so far  hope it lasts  more words ok the style looks sheik hanging on wall  looks good and very quiet  i like the nite light that s built into it  great value for the money  bigger than most travel size blow dryers but the folding handle is still a great feature and still helps with space  the three speeds is a bonus too  i ve read some reviews that say the retractable cord stopped working after a week  but i ve had absolutely no trouble and it s been a couple of months  i m wondering if those people are retracting the cord before or after they fold the handle   it seems to me it should be done before to give the cord a clear path   all in all a great purchase  dries my thick hair very quickly  it makes quick work of straightening my hair while blow drying  leaves my hair

the light was better  this is a great hair dryer  the light is a nice feature  it is a bit bright though as i already purchased one of these a couple of yrs ago and the light was better  i discovered this hair dryer while on a vacation with my husband  it was a high end hotel that we stayed in  i was in need of a new dryer and the power this one emitted was exceptional  the retractable cord is a bonus  it s not the quietest hair dryer but  it isn t obnoxious  either  you gotta expect some noise with that much power  i love it  it s so nice to be able to have the cord wind itself up inside the dryer and out of the way  it s so nice to be able to have the cord wind itself up inside the dryer and out of the way  i love the color and the convent hanging loop the switches could be simpler and larger it s a light in weight product  pretty nifty for my weekend cabin guesthouse and great for my rv  just like the ones at the hotels  nice to have it on the wall and out of the way  pretty nifty for my weekend cabin guesthouse and great for my rv  just like the ones at the hotels  nice to have it on the wall and out of the way  i love the look and the power of the dryer but something about the ion makes my hair greasy  other then that it s a great product  i never realized how much difference a good hair dryer makes on your hair   i m a cancer survivor and have been growing out my hair   i needed a new hair dryer and i didn t want another one from the drugstore   i started researching hair dryers on the internet and kept reading about the onei hair dryer  i love the different settings and it s light weight in your hand  just wish it had a retractable cord  it s a great medium priced product   you certainly could pay a lot more for a hair dryer but the onei is perfect   this product was the perfect size for me to take on my vacation abroad   it took very little room to pack it and worked well  purchased based on reviews and two features   folding handle and retracting cord   useful in the home and for travel  performs as advertised and rated  this is the best gift my sis says she loves it thanks for this product it is a winner  thanks again  i purchased

up with the babyliss and decided to purchase this well rated hair dryer  br   i like that there are three temperature settings  good air flow  and two attachments for channeled or diffused air  i have curly hair  so i use both attachments and are happy with their performance  another great thing about this product is that i can feel safe that the intake side won t suck up my long hair and result in unfortunate hair loss  the mesh is good quality and in a tight configuration  the intake is also very easy to ope close  which makes it easy to clean out any dust that may accumulate overtime  whenever i clean the intake  i feel like my hair dryer is new since the air flow is so good after cleaning  br   i have had this hair dryer for over a year and would repurchase it for the price and functionality  this is such an amazing hair dryer  it does my hair so fast and doesn t leave it with any static  i will buy this dryer again when i need to  the main feature of this dryer that i find

researched dryers extensively  bought the andis  retractable  etc   liked it br   for size  worked well  the switches weren t ideal  but    then after a year it stopped clicking br   into full position    i didn t fold   retract regularly   then a piece that fell out of br   the mechanism got into the motor  into the trash  not even worth salvaging  i bought the 18575w at goodwill for br    99   love it  better than the andis  unlike many other reviewers  i find the switch br   to be zero problem  actually prefer it  plus nothing is in the way of ones hand while drying  br   there you go  there s no telling   opinions are anecdotal  i like this unit after reading product description  i ordered it  i have to travel to countries where we have 220volt power supply and i purchased a special voltage converter for hair dryers only  br    br   when i received it and read the safety guidlines in the note inside the package  i came to know i can not use this product with extension

reason for this choice  over one on wheels   somewhat noisy  who cares  wonderful heat   could use some more air holes   this is not made as good as the one i had to toss that was more than 40 yrs old

great  certainly powerful  and excellent value for money  other that the cord being a bit short  i m very satisfied with it i bought this for my wife because i became convinced she was going to go deaf eventually from her previous hairdryer  i found it deafening from down the hallway but she s running the thing for minutes a day right next to her ears     br    br   this one is remarkably quieter   still a noisy gadget  but what a difference   much lower decibels and a more pleasant  lower frequency sound as well  br    br   the jury seems to be out on whether ions do anything or not  but after a couple weeks  use she did remark that it worked faster and she thought her hair looked better too  my husband i travel a lot   there are times we need a blow dryer   the dryer is small and

hair dryer works great buy and deal i do not speak english  but i ll try  very good product  works well  has the necessary heat levels  i have not submitted any flaw  i recommend  is light  not heavy  my experience has been good with this product  i am a woman of color and i have to say i am very  very impressed with this dryer   rarely can i just buy a product like this one that actually works on my hair  especially when i have to do it myself and i have a very nice grade of hair    it get really hot and actually drys the roots and straightens my hair   i wish i could say that for the numerous curling irons i ve bought   the one   34 con  34  i have is that if you are not proficient in drying your own hair with this type of dryer you can get burned and you should take your jewelry off  i suggest you get some kind of attachment to put on the dryer to assist in drying your hair  this dryer is good enough  although the switch that controls the power of the wind feels a bit unstable  the wind power is just perfect  and the price is really reasonable  i ve had many good hair dryers and this one might be the best  lightweight  powerful and it makes my hair so smooth  i ve had many good hair dryers and this one might be the best  lightweight  powerful and it makes my hair so smooth  looks good easy to install fast ship like the fact you can take off vent and clean when its time also

manner   i couldn t ask for anything more   i am definitely going to buy a second one for my mother as a christmas present  no issues with light  some people mentioned it died    been working ok for almost a month now  br   does the job and does it quite well   quite powerful and dries hair well   now for the price its great  the reason i bought this particular one was because i used it at a hotel and liked the product   br   now the reason for 3 stars  br   the quality of the stand and the plastic itself are quite inferior  feel like it gonna crank in about 3 months  the first one i had received had a mold defect and there was a huge dent in the middle so i returned it and got another piece from amazon  easy  and free  return i should say    but the fact that its quite plastic ey and the second one i received had the same dent  just smaller  so the finishing is not that great    but i should add it works and does what it should efficiently  i think i would give it 5 stars if it was  5 more expensive but was better quality finishing   i always wanted one of those hair dryers like in a hotel  now i have my own  conveniently hung at the side of  my sink  plenty of power for drying hair  easy installation  i always wanted one of those hair dryers like in a hotel  now i have my own  conveniently hung at the side of  my sink  plenty of power for drying hair  easy

quality  blows plenty  of hot air  the cord winds well into the dryer this item was exactly as described and the price was great   i would definitely recommend it and purchase this item again  it has

it  love it was concerned about purple color  but it is not bad  it is a darker purple that looks more regal than gouche  the blow dryer itself is powerful and effective  good buy  this is a great product for the price  it was very easy to put together too  i would order it again  this is a great product for the price  it was very easy to put together too  i would order it again  very high quality product   it arrived very quickly and was in excellent shape when received   god daughter really enjoyed getting it and uses it constantly  i had this dryer for a about four months until the motor fan began to spark and i decided it was no longer safe to use  prior to this however  it worked wonderfully  shame it broke  i had this dryer for a about four months until the motor fan began to spark and i decided it was no longer safe to use  prior to this however  it worked wonderfully  shame it broke  the unit does the job of drying hair just fine  but would be easier to use if the dryer hood height was adjustable  this product is awesome   mount it in your bathroom on the wall and no hassle finding and using it  br   we have now bought 4 of these  3 for our home and one as a gift to a house guest who loved it   br   highly recommend  this product is awesome   mount it in your bathroom on the wall and no hassle finding and using it  br   we have now bought 4 of these  3 for our home and one as a gift to a house guest who loved it   br   highly recommend  so  we bought this dryer as a replacement for my wife s old  loud unit  br    br   unboxed it  and it felt nice and solidly built  and it was about mid range  volume wise  also a good selection of heat and fan speed adjustments  but  the first morning of use  it ran for about 3 4 minutes  then the breaker plug began to buzz loudly  and emit smoke  br    br   all use was discontinued  and was returned for a refund  br    br   i award it 2 stars for it being a potentially good unit  but subtract 3 for failing  this seems like a fluke  as most of the reviews are positive  but i m going to be searching for a different dryer anyway  this is a great product   perfect size and very powerful and dual voltage   i

difference in hairdryers  but let me tell you  there is   i had a ceramic heated conair hairdryer   while visiting family  i had to borrow a hairdryer because i forgot to pack mine   the way my hair looked when it was dry was amazing   it looked so smooth and shiny   not the norm when using my conair   i looked at the name brand and took note right away   so glad i was able to purchase on amazon

dries my thick hair very quick  its the only one its size that has a retractable cord  i love its size  performance  this one seems to work great  however  i do think the level of the wind is a little bit wired  i use this blow dryer daily  it works for me  that way i won t have to borrow my daughters on  a good price as well  aside from being a bit heavy  i love this dryer  to be fair  i had been working with an ancient blow dryer that didn t have ceramic or tourmaline heating plates so of course this would work far better  and i ve been using the argon oil that came with it which is a dimethicone based product    of course my hair would be silkier than when i use my homemade aloe   grape seed oil concoction  so whether its the dryer  the products or the combination  i m not sure  but in either case i am happy with the results each and every time   i ve used it 4 or 5 times by now   this is a great hairdryer for the money  it s light weight and has a cleanable filter which should extend the life of the dryer  this is a great hairdryer for the money  it s light weight and has a cleanable filter which should extend the life of the dryer  the number of heat and airflow

furious  no frizz love it you don t need a flat iron after using that tool  it looks nice and its really affordable    glad that i got it  this was the first time i spent  more than  40 for a hair dryer  so i was expecting it to be great  but after about a month the attachment nozzle kept following off  however the dryer works well  it is still aggravating for the nozzle to fly off while drying my hair  i should have returned it  too much money for an okay hair dryer  hair dryer was amazing until it started to struggle and make sounds after 2 months of use and completely stopped   broke at 6 months  contacting the company direct for a replacement since amazon could not help  br    br    135 is too much to pay for a hair dryer that lasts 6 months     even if it was amazing when it worked

try   i ordered the onei mk ll  a different brand than my daughters   i loved it the first time  i used it   i color my hair and it is on the thin side and this dryer tames the frizzies and adds body and shine  br   my daughter tried it when she came to visit and  of course  loved it   so  i bought her one  too   she claims that it is light  easy to handle  dries her hair quicker and over all  does a much better job than her old one  br   the delivery was prompt and product was in good condition   no problems  i ve had this hairdryer for less than a year and its button functions  are not working anymore even though the hairdryer itself is in perfect condition  br   it is a shame that conair uses such cheap materials for their products  by far the best hair dryer i have owned  i have very frizzy curly hair and this dryer definitely does its job  i can tell a huge difference after using it the first time  i use this hair dryer every day and i don t feel as if it s doing a   34 great  34  drying job   i previously had a revlon mini which worked just great   in any case  will continue to use this one until it dies  this is a a wonderful dryer  and it didn t cost an arm and a leg  why didn t i buy it earlier  this is a a wonderful dryer  and it didn t cost an arm and a leg  why didn t i buy it earlier  this is a great product   i didn t really believe all the ionic hype

revlon matte chrome full size turbo hair dryer   rv473v1 on amazon  but sent it back as it only got lukewarm  then i bought a conair infiniti which i also returned because even on low the intensity was so strong my shoulder length hair kept getting all snarled and knotted  i figured it was because the opening of the nozzle was too big  so i set out to find one that was narrower  this dryer works perfectly  doesn t get too hot  has 3 temps and 2 speeds and a cool blast if you need it  good attachments  lightweight  not really loud  removable filter  ionic ceramic  the color is not my favorite  but what matters is it works  love this hairdryer  using it in the uk so had to purchase suitable adaptor   works well with attachments and is very easy to use  only issue is that even on minimum setting it gets quite hot so i won t be using it with the attachments all the time as i don t want to damage my hair too much  great dryer to replace an old wall mounted one  heat settings are very good and installation was easy and fast i truly don t understand anyone who would pay more or could want more than what this hair dryer offers   it s fantastic   the settings  noise level  weight  what it does to my hair   all of it   it s great  i received this product and am very happy with it   it is so powerful that even with my very think hair  it is dry within minutes   by far the best product i own for drying my hair  great hairdryer the wife is very happy  i went with this one because it had many reviews and seemed popular great hairdryer the wife is very happy  i went with this

well  dries your hair very fast  i love that there are multiple setting for temperature and speed i m male with long hair  this dryer works just fine for me  i read the good reviews on amazon before i bought it  i feel the dryer is adequate in every way and a lot better than most i ve had  so  why not 5 stars  i don t know  maybe it is the look or the feel  but whatever it is  this dryer does a great job  for me it is just not easy to love a hair dryer  i am very happy with this hair dryer  i must agree with others  though  the night light is very bright  i read other reviewers who said it was bright  but i couldn t imagine such a small light being so bright  my dryer is in a bathroom off the bedroom and it lights up all the bathroom and part of the bedroom  i covered the light with 2 thickness of duck tape and it is still very bright  i like having the night light  but it could be a   34 bit  34  dimmer  the dryer works fine and i like having a place to hang the cord on the dryer so it doesn t lay on the sink  that is a great feature  i use this hairdryer 3 4 times a week  great power and is quite nice   plus it s in my favorite color  red  its good  dryes my hair really fast and its cute too  i got 2 one for me and one for my friend she loves it as well  i purchased this hairdryer because it s the one my beautician uses  i loved how fast it was to blowdry my hair   i got

definitely recommend this blow dryer to a friend  pros  br   not to hot on hot setting br   retractable cord works great  keeps clutter off the counter  br    br   cons  br   none really to mention   br    br   edit  05 06 2013 br   i have noticed when i use the blow dryer now that there some some air escaping from the slider controls on the handle  this is nothing to really change how i use the blow dryer  but this should probably not happen  ive always really liked the travel sized blow dryers  and this one is wonderful not to heavy and drys my hair in half the time  it works fine but i wish it had a hook on the handle so i could hang it up  also so sometimes my hair gets stuck in the top of it when it is drawing in air  googled hair dryer  found it at amazon com one of my trusted sites  ordered it and got it 4 days ago  it is better than the old one as this model has an led night light built in  great product  working fine  br    br   thanks br   amazon i love the blow dryer

very convenient  would not hesitate to deal with this company again  i ordered the onei mk ii air ionique hair dryer for my wife just over a week ago and she is thrilled with it   she loves the variable temperature feature   the first time she used the dryer she said   34 my hair looks great   34   i would certainly recommend this dryer   the price is excellent for a professional quality

them too  very nice blow dryer  bit of an odor the first uses  it needs to burn off before it will fade  pretty and very happy with the number of speed and heat settings  very nice blow dryer  bit of an odor the first uses  it needs to burn off before it will fade  pretty and very happy with the number of speed and heat settings  i only wish that i had bought this blow dryer when ever they first came out   my hair drys in more than half of the time faster    excellent product    considering the lower price this conair turbo slyler does everything it claimed it could do  i used another brand before and wasn t happy with it  considering the lower price this conair turbo slyler does everything it claimed it could do  i used another brand before and wasn t happy with it  considering the lower price this conair turbo slyler does everything it claimed it could do  i used another brand before and wasn t happy with it  this thing pumps out hot air pretty much instantaneously  great for people with no patience  it might be nice if it had more oomph on the high setting  but my girlfriend says the same thing so i guess i shouldn t throw stones  i use it everyday  it works great  no problems  good price  i got one for every bathroom   good power  easy buy  after spending another vacation week in a hilton using this wonderful dryer  i knew it would be disappointing to go home and not have one  its compact  perfect heat settings  2  and so easy to use  the cord is the perfect length  i never take a blowdryer with me when i travel because i just love these wall mounted ones by sunbeam  you have one button to push to turn it on and then when you re done  just put the dryer back into its holder and it automatically turns off  its easy to clean  and easy to change the wattage setting  i mounted it near my mirror and the nightlight which i thought would not be a good thing  turns out to be so perfect in the middle of the night  having two heat settings as far as inside the dryer to save electricity is great for those that want a softer not as hot two setting dryer or those that are trying to save money among other things  its perfect  i gave away my other dryer and never looked back  br    br   get it  you ll love it  really i promise  we have a tiny bathroom with no storage this hair dryer is so perfect it s out of the way when not in use does not take up drawer space even has a night light  for the price it is really great  i like this product  it would be nice if it could be adjusted more than two settings but it is very handy and dries hair very fast   i suppose the more expensive one have more settings  it does get very hot  when your done it just pops back in the wall holder and the cord hangs up on the knob so it s out of the way  good power with very low noise   robust design   the night light does the job well  the dryer was easy to install  perfect hair dryer  does the job  comes with 2 add on s for scrunching hair or blowing it out straight  the retractable cord is a space saver life saver  perfect hair dryer  does the job  comes with 2 add on s for scrunching hair or blowing it out straight  the retractable cord is a space

easier to use  the unit automatically shuts off when returned to the cradle  no need to spend money on higher priced units  very nice product do not buy  it was great while it lasted  but it shorted out after 3 months of use  br   quiet and seemed to be quality   until its very early smoking  stinking death  br    br   find another that lasts longer  does everything the manufacturer states and the price was well worth it   shipping was quick and product was in good condition   would recommend this hair dryer  this hairdryer is everything i need  great choice for me  would reccomend to anyone that does not need a professional type hair dryer but my first one was  300  i was thrilled to find one at this low price  and it has additional features  i love it because it works faster yet quieter than other blow driers  is supposedly healthier for hair  mine is definitely less dry since using it    and doesn t blow my hair all over at the high setting   it is very pleasant to use  also my first one was a featherweight and i didn t notice that this one was not until it was already shipping  i decided to see if it was heavier  and it is not  so i am completely satisfied  i bring this with me to nice hotels because it s always better than whatever they provide  have had it for about 2 years  works superbly  has lots of power  the handle still folds as when it was new  the retractable cable mechanism still works like it did when it was new  affordable price  all things considered it is a great product  have had it for about 2 years  works superbly  has lots of power  the handle still folds as when it was new  the retractable cable mechanism still works like it did when it was new  affordable price  all things considered it is a great product  my husband does a lot of traveling and had commented he liked the hair dryers that are in hotels that hang on the wall  i bought us one and am sure glad i did  it s nice just to reach up and have it there ready to use  instead of having it in a drawer or under the counter with the cord wrapped around it  loved it so much bought our son and daughter one for there homes  they like theirs also  br   would highly recommend  would be great if it had a rubberized grip around the handle for better control  but other than that  it s worked great so far   good power  heat on high is pretty good  that s what i needed  it s fixed on the wall and always ready to be used  very convenient and efficient  great  i love remington products   this hair dryer has performed perfectly for the  20 i got it for on amazon  br   i replaced my conair ion shine after 7 years   regret not doing it sooner  br   my hair was frizzing and i thought it was because of my age   nope   my conair was shot  br   so since the on off switch broke on the conair   i finally decided that was unsafe enough to warrant a new hair dryer  br    plus i never like the switches on that dryer anyway  br   i love this tstudio hair dryer   it is not too loud   which is great if you suffer from hearing or headache issues  br   i love the color   it is extremely attractive   it is a dark chocolate brown with a pinky purple accent   goes nicely with my bathroom decor   oh   and the best part   it does not hurt my hands   it is ergonomic   i feels like a dream   it is a perfect fit in my palm and i don t feel the switches are in the way at all   i found that i naturally held the dryer so the thumb was grasping along the length of the switches which is perfect   so excited about that part  br   was going to buy the bablyss  sp   but when i checked that out on youtube  i intensely disliked the noise of it  br   so   remington it is   i hope that i get at least 3 or 4 years out of it and i will be an extremely happy customer  was exactly what i was needing  girlfriend has now purchased 3 of these  the turbo option is great and we will continue to get the same model i have thin hair and this dryer did an awesome job w giving me lots of volumn  i m happy to have given it a try  keeper  this is the seocnd one of these i have owned and the first lasted over 10 years   gret product  glad i could find it again on amazon  br   the mutipe temperature settings make it a dream to have   love it    the one major downside to this drier is that it vibrates in my hand which i don t like  it does dry my hair very fast and the cord keeper works perfectly  this hair dyer works great and i have seen it for more money at local stores  i highly recommend it  one of those   saw one just like it in a motel while on vaca with my gf a few years back   i thought more of it than she did  primarily because the more things kept off her bathroom counter  the better   br   that s what she thought  too  that i bought this as a  message     which is why she s used it maybe three times in four years since i installed it there for her  br   it s a great hair dryer  i let mine air dry  my hair looks more like michael bolton s  or fabio s  that way   br   this little dryer still works great  i guess  i turn it on every once in awhile to check   br   yay  relationship issues  quality  this is the best hair dryer i have used  hands down  my favorite feature is that it doesn t produce a ton of noise like the t3 i previously had  and if you have a sleeping baby in the next room you ll really appreciate the low noise it makes  the performance is perfect and the temperature and fan speed are fully adjustable  i set mine on negative ion  which helps my hair look great before work and after the gym  my wife and i share it and she s as satisfied with the quality as i am  br    br   price  for the price  you can t beat this dryer  i paid over  200 for a t3 and the onei feels  looks  and sounds like a better product  the performance of both are good  but the onei has more adjustment options  so i have to rate it higher  br    br   shipping  i came back from a two day business trip and it was waiting for me  even though i didn t expect it for a week or so  of course the wife got to it first    br    br   customer service  the seller sent me a nice email to make sure i was satisfied with the quality and shipping speed  i couldn t ask for better customer service  br    br   overall  highly recommended  both dyer and seller  thank you  yes  i love it   it is so easy to use and the force of the hot air dries my hair very fast  this product is very very good  i purchased it after seeing my roommates use this one  it is completely worth the money and it gives a nice blow dry leaving your hair feel awesome  this product is very very good  i purchased it after seeing my roommates use this one  it is completely worth the money and it gives a nice blow dry leaving your hair feel awesome  i thought this would be a bit smaller and had a retractable cable   in the end  it s still a good product  this dryer allows me to move around while my hair is drying  have conversation and  watch my favorit television programs  br    br   you have to be sure that you snap the bonnet seal to the tube so that it locks before putting it on   you may have to practice a few times to know how to lock it  br    br   great product  compact size perfect for traveling and powerful enough to do its job  i am very pleased with it and the price is very reasonable  very good  we recommend it for multiples use for

travel hair dryer  very light yet powerful  works even better than my full sized one  i use it at home too  this dryer is very nice  and my wife is completely satisfied   on the other hand  i liked the older one better because it was more forceful and the cord was longer   we didn t have to dim the light on the old one  but this one is very bright and i had to tape something over it to tone it down   i used a piece of thick paper that i cut to exactly cover the light and it is ok now  br   it s a very nice product and i think that we would order it again  my hair dresser recommended this dryer   she said it would reduce frizzies   it has and i am pleased   i like the way it folds up for traveling   i will get great use of it  my hair dresser recommended this dryer   she said it would

nice unit but not enough room to store everything in side compartment   you can put items in  but unit will not close it works  i didn t expect anything wonderful since the price was low  you get what you pay for  i guess  it works  i didn t expect anything wonderful since the price was low  you get what you pay for  i guess  i am very happy with my new hair dryer  it drys my hair faster and does

could easily travel with  br   this little dryer has lots of power  and very happy that is comes with the concentrator  which many of the others dont   br   only thing is it does get pretty hot  so

i want to make sure before i purchase this dryer  it had happend before to me good little blow dryer for travel internationally  worked perfectly with 240v  i have never found a hotel blow dryer that works on my curly frizzy hair so it was great to have this tool along  especially in a very humid climate  lots of air volume and heat  don t bother looking for a transformer for your 110v blow dryer if it s more than 1600w because you will have problems and possibly even damage your appliance from home  i have had this for over a year and it still works great br   the cold button works fast br   the cleaning sheild is a great feature to remove lint really good hairdryer  purchased this one after our other conair  who s still going strong   was just getting too old  speeds are nice and it

with separate controls for temperature and wind speed are good features   i saw there were mixed reviews  but assumed revlon had made the product well   after two months of 10 to 15 minutes of use a day with the included diffuser  it spit blue fire and turned itself off   i m thankful for the safety feature  but have returned the item for a full refund   i m not willing to risk catching my hair

going  this one is strong enough to get thick hair the heat is needs for a great blow out i have my pro blow dryer but with tweenagers always around  having this for them to use at the house is great and nice to have in the guest bath  very happy with the quality and durabilty  works well and i don t feel like i m damaging my hearing when using it   shipped quickly   stores well and electrical cord recoil is cool  great product  i bought one for a gift and one for myself  easy to use  doesn t get to hot  and lightweight  great product at a great price  provides just the right temperature  and dries very well  have had no issues with it since purchase  highly recommended  this is one of the best hair dryers i have ever used   it is very quiet and light   since it s an ionic it leave your hair smooth and shiny   it s a full size hairdryer but travels very well since it s so lightweight   i would highly recommened it   i am picky about hairdryers because they always make a very loud sound but i feel like the power and force just isn t there  this conair i have been very happy with it is strong and take an adequate time to dry my hair  if this ever dies  i will buy this same dryer again  i love this blow dryer  it s so quiet and it does an outstanding job     my friend had lended me hers and i loved it so i went out and purchase one of my own  excellent job very satisfied

does  she is very happy with it  my sister in law asked for this hairdryer for christmas  very handy for all the travel she does  she is very happy with it  this hair dryer worked great while it lasted   only buy it if you are looking for one that collapses and has a retractable cord for travel   otherwise  you are much better off getting something else this hair dryer is small and easy to handle  but the best thing is the air flow  many hair dryers use the word turbo in their description  but this one truly has turbo air flow  it dries my hair quickly and leaves it shining  i love it     i use it everyday  one of the best blow dryers i have purchased  my hairstyles uses it on her clients  this works great and does the job i need it to do   i m giving it four stars instead of five because of the storage issue   i don t like having to cram the cord and extention to the hood back inside the case each time   i would prefer a slightly larger case that would accomodate everything more easily  bought this hairdryer based on great reviews and so far it s been great  lightweight and comes with a couple attachments for extra shine or curly hair  get s the job done  great product exactly how it is described  you can t beat a revlon blow dryer  it s also very affordable and compact  i bought my hair dryer about 6 months ago   i wasn t overly impressed with it   it never seemed to get as hot as my previous t3 dryer and didn t smooth my hair like before   the topper came yesterday when the dryer started sparking as i was using it leaving a nice burn on my arm   i thought  90 for this dryer was a deal compared to stores but truth is the dryer isn t worth  9    either t3 is making really cheap products or this is a knock off   buyer beware   nightlight is very bright  beware if bathroom is off the bedroom  you may need to cover it to tone it down  otherwise  the hairdryer is excellent   nice to be able to set power for either 1200 or 1600 watts  recessed switch  takes a tool   then you have high low finger switch  my hairdresser comes to my house and this is absolutely perfect for home use   the temperature is just right and the hood is comfortable  my

dryers and really does the job  throughout extensive travels  i would find this model in better hotels   resorts and decided to get one for myself   really good  easy to control and direct to exact spots for drying and styling   doesn t have a   34 cool shot  34  button  but i really don t miss it  nice product with a lot of power   i love how the cord reels up inside of the dryer for storage   great buy  nice product with a lot of power   i love how the cord reels up inside of the dryer for storage   great buy  weight is good and the air preassure is great too   one small thing i don t like about it is the button location for the temp   my fingers wrap around that part of the handle and they hit that button and change the temp   i would buy again though     this was my 3rd dryer in about 6 months  couldn t seem to find one with the right amount of heat and airflow   this one is perfect  great product for the price  very light  and powerful  you don t have to spend a lot of money for a

wait  this is a good basic dryer   i don t use the attachments but find that it works quickly and is easy to hold   i don t think that it being tourmaline ceramic adds much to the product s quality  but it s still a fine product  my husband continues to tease me because i continue to gush about how much i love this blow dryer  he says ooooh   it plugs in and blows air   how special  says the man with little hair to blow    this is a great dryer   i have longish straight hair   and it dries it in a heartbeat without frying my hair   the variety of settings really work well   and the cool shot

dryer now as i write this review and even though it is very cheaply made i am impressed with the heat settings  high is indeed very high heat and perfect for when i do my deep conditioning treatments   the airflow is not bad either considering where the holes are place   all around the top of the hood  and then the airflow from the opening in the back  i can actually see this doing a good job on my hair if i were to roller set and get under the dryer no problem   if you are just looking for a cheap but gets the job done such as deep conditioning with heat for 15 20 minutes type of hair dryer then i say buy this one  its ok for its price  i purchased this hair dryer over two years ago  after using one at a hotel  and it s still going strong   it s a great dryer   light weight  perfect size

and frankly deserves attention br   the experiences of this product i am relieved a lot br    and all my friends who saw him aaajabu i purchased this based on a write up in prevention magazine   yes  a great dryer with lots of shine but the locations of the control button stink   i spend more time reselecting the temperature speed on   off  as no matter how you hold this dryer  you are pressing a switch   i would recommend this to no one   it s just poorly designed  i first used this hair dryer at courtyard marriott  it worked so good and did wonders for my hair  i was thrilled to see that amazon was selling these  it dries my hair fast and gives it a silky smooth look  i highly recommend this hair dryer  i saw this dryer in good housekeeping magazine and decided to give it a try  even though i was pretty happy with my current 1875 watt dryer   this one really is better   dries faster  and seems very gentle   the cooling feature is great for setting curls and body  br    br   i ordered a second dryer for my daughter  but when it came there was an unpleasant buzzing sound when running on high speed   i knew this wasn t right   i contacted amazon about the defective product  return shipping was free and easy  and a replacement arrived in two days   thanks  amazon  i was extremely excited to try out this product and i have to say  i have been impressed with it  i normally set the blow dryer to it s highest and warmest setting  and i am very pleased with the performance of this dryer in that regard  it is extremely powerful  but it doesn t get too hot or overheat if i don t move it constantly  a nice feature that many other dryers i ve used don t have  i don t personally use the add on attachment  so i can t comment on it  but it seems like it would be a useful tool for those who needed that specific form of styling  this a wonderful little dryer at a remarkably low price  it is quiet and efficient  this is a very  good buy     recommended  i m no hairdryer expert  but this fit my needs perfectly  it folds and retracts nicely and dries my hair quickly  i m no hairdryer expert  but this fit my needs perfectly  it folds and retracts nicely and dries my hair quickly  this product was a worthy buy  it is inexpensive and not heavy duty  great for everyday use and it s light weight makes it easy to pack for travelling  when i bought my first t 3 i paid  220 00 at a hair salon  i was told it was hands down  the best blow dryer  it was awesome  but after 3 years i started having problems  i certainly didn t want to pay 200 00 dollars again but the drug store dryers were not powerful enough for my hair      so my daughter encouraged me to try amazon  i never thought i would find the t 3 on amazon but to my surprise i did find it  i was able to get a brand new  perfect t 3 for 64 95 from discount jungle  i was a little nervous till i got it but it was perfect  it works better than the one i got from the salon    i feel like i got the deal of my

stge of your hair  wet  damp   great for touch ups  too  i am very pleased with the purchase and the attachments that come with it  great investment  my old faithful conair finally died and this dryer was the replacement   and a dandy one it has turned out to be   it dries very quickly compared to my older model and it is lighter weight and easier to handle   no problems of any kind   good purchase  this small and powerful dryer is perfect for my bathroom   up and out of the way  easy to mount  highly recommend  i does not have a difuser  but is a very lite and comfortable grip  leaves your hair shinny  like it  i really like this blow dryer  it has a very strong motor and gets the job done quickly  the price was just right  love this blowdryer  it is a bit louder than my chi nano and isn t as powerful but it doesn t seem to effect the drying time  also i would love for it to have a stand but no biggie    when i first came across this product i thought this looked gfeat and i wanted buy it  whwn i received it in the mail  i still thought it looked great but it could definifintely use some improving  the case itself at the top left corner of my phone comes apart sometimes and i havent even dropped my phone    the pictures description did not indicate that it can be wall mounted  i mounted it on the wall with screws  i found a wall stud for one screw location  and it is excellent  br   don t mount it vertically  you should mount it  with the slot at a 45 degree angle and not perpendicular  this way  your dryer can be rotated around its vertical axis   so that you can easy adjust to your preference of distance from the wall etc   br    br   it is unfortunate  that this product is currently unavailable  i hope the seller would notice this review and offer more   i know i will be installing this in 3 more of my bath rooms  as soon as they become available  very nice hair blowers   easy to attach to bathroom wall   makes it very handy to use and there is no need for a

heavier than most folding dryer s the price was good and so far the quality has been good also  this hair dryer has a lower noise level when in use   many dryers have a very high pitch whine from the fan motor   fan was found as the dryer provided in a hampton inn  two other hair dryers died in one week   this came quickly  and in good condition   i seems to do a good job  and to offer options for heat and power   i d purchase from the vendor again  got this for a relative for xmas  she is very pleased with it  it has 3 fan speeds  which is not that easy to find any more  it comes with a couple of drying accessories  too  it is not lightweight though  which  in my view is the only shortcoming  works fantastic and came with a diffuser and another nozzle for straigtening  very inexpensive and

everybody said something good about this hair dryer  that was enought for my to buy it  and she love it but she said takes time to dryer the hair  so i thought double fan must to be enought but not   is kind of weird because is a remington one of the best   but is fine  so what do you think  bought this for my girlfriend over a year ago and it s still working  br    br   the very nice soft touch coating has started to peel away pretty significantly though  but for  25 i guess i can t complain too much  my wife has been wanting one of these after our first motel several years  now we have one of the best hair dryers we have ever had works great arrived earlier than told  i bought this dryer 2 months ago  and even with light use  it has now quit working  don t buy this   it s junk  however  i would have prefered a more diverse group of piks   i bought my husband a waterpik for christmas  which he loved    i wanted to get a set for myself  but this one only has 3 types  none really as cool as his  and dups of all three    it s a good beginner set i guess    but i will be searching for some of the better ones that came with his  i can t complain about quality   look closely at the piks   if you want two of each of the basics   this is pefect for you  i love all things fresh    but this bath soak is truly the best  the scent is absolutely luxurious  filling your entire bath bedroom with soothing aromatics  i don t get many uses out of it because my large bathtub requires i use a lot  but it is an absolute treat when i do  i even save the bottles as a keepsake  no need to visit the spa as long as fresh keeps making sake  love  love  love it  this is a great curling wand  gives great curls that last for days and doesnt frizz out  i was worried that i would burn my self since there s no heat control but i got used to it pretty quickly without the need of the glove   wish personally i dont think would have helped much anyway  overall  a great buy   love the color  also  a very nice surprise was the fact that it indeed does have a swivel cord  even though the description says it doesnt  this was a gift  the receiver of the was most pleased  i enjoyed shopping on amazon  they make it very easy to purchase as many items as you wish  this was a gift  the receiver of the was most pleased  i enjoyed shopping on amazon  they make it very easy to purchase as many items as you wish  this is a great hair dryer  it really does seem like i have more volume  i got mine on sale otherwise i don t if the price is great if you re tight on money but i would buy it again for sure  conair 2000 watt hair dryer is perfect  transaction was smooth and quick  excellent deal  durable product powerful and easy to use  surprised when it arrived early next morning  i ve used another popular brand of hair dryer for years  but i recently purchased a remington straightener  and i then decided to update my years old hair dryer  after doing lots of research  i found that this was the most popular remington hair dryer and had great reviews  i have used it a couple of times since receiving it  and i like it  i think i prefer my previous hair dryer more  as the hair seemed softer  but this one does just fine  and actually dries my hair faster than my older one  i was looking for ionic  and this has that as well  buy this hair dryer on amazon  i found it was the cheapest price  try it out for yourself  installed this for my wife  to try to keep the counter uncluttered  good quality product very easy to mount  easy to use  would like the cord about 1ft longer  but love it anyway  especially like the way it shuts off when you push it back in its holder  and it has a magnetic clasp to hold it    very happy well  i haven t used the product yet  but it s small size is perfect for packing  i ll try to remember to leave additional feedback on its use  love this dryer   first saw at hotel in san diego   i had to have it   amazon had it the cheapest on the internet  i would recommend this product  i redid my bath  hung this on the medicine chest  love the night light  great performace  the best blower ever   max i redid my bath  hung this on the medicine chest  love the night light  great performace  the best blower ever   max a review from my mother in law  br    br    my hair is thinning and this dryer gives me volume   with my head upside down while blow drying  in just a couple of minutes  i have full  shiny and manageable hair   the user friendly design is  great too   the heat and speed settings are at a comfortable spot on the handle and unlike my last dryer  they stay where i set them  br   definitely a good purchase this is a great hair dryer   drys my hair quickly without getting overly hot   i like the placement of the switches so you can just use your thumb to adjust the heat and flow while you are drying and styling  we bought one of these two years ago  for our remodeled bathroom   worked perfectly  so when we moved into our new house in 2011  we bought another one   again  works perfectly  very convenient  very well built    two criticisms    the night light is too bright   a dimmer on the side would be much preferred   and  the wall anchors that come with it really suck   you ll need to buy a set of anchors to mount it correctly     that said  we re buying another for our second bathroom   it s a great unit  bought this for my mom for christmas  let me tell yah it was a real chore for a man to choose a blow dryer online for a woman  but the price and weight of this item was good  i especially liked that it has a 4 year warranty  bought this for my mom for christmas  let me tell yah it was a real chore for a man to choose a blow dryer online for a woman  but the price and weight of this item was good  i especially liked that it has a 4 year warranty  i placed this on my wishlist and it was purchased for me for christmas   i love the color and the cord keeper  however it is very very loud on any setting  it was a great deal  it s worth the price  my wife loves it  it is powerful  and until now is not heating in excess  even when a small problem arose  customer service was so accommodating  very nice dryer  excellent customer service and very prompt responses  i was so tired of wimpy hairdryers that i had to buy this hairdryer after reading the other reviews   the reviews are correct   the air that comes out of this dryer is incredible    it dries my hair quickly  but the nice thing is that it dries your hair with air and not by baking it with intense heat   it is hot  but not scorching   a great purchase  this hair dryer is made with quality  it is not heavy  not noisy  hot and offered at a good price  amazon did a great job wtih sending me an expedited replacement order at no cost to me when my original order was lost in delivery  it was more than i expected  package was deluxe and product quality is super   i am in love with my hair dryer  over 10 years ago i bought a wall mounted blow dryer after using it in a hotel while on a business trip  i loved it   when that died  i couldn t find a dryer in any retail store that came close to its quality and durability   well  i have now  the oster wall mounted dryer is easy to set up and easier to use  it s powerful  but compact  it dries my hair faster  and styles it better than any product i ve used to date  no popped circuit breakers  either  so i know it uses less energy   i won t be needing another blow dryer for the next decade  and is that ever nice  mounted both items in the master bathroom  i m completely satiefied with them  strong air flow nice cord length and easy instalation  i love this little lightweight hair dryer  i used it at a motel in point pleasant  n j  i could not wait to purchase my own  more powerful than my other dryer with a lot more voltage  got this for over a month now  it is working great  i usually do not dry my hair  but living in ne there are a lot of snow days in the winter  i need to dry my hair before i head out  i am very satisfied with this hair dryer  no complains  my wife use it every day   good hair dryer  oster professional 76932 710 wall mount hair dryer    great   no complains  my wife use it every day   good hair dryer  oster professional 76932 710 wall mount hair dryer    great   my wife love this  its very compact with a folding handle  it has an option for warm or normal air  much more is that it s auto volt so you can use it anywhere  a true travel dryer styler  highly recommended  i love this blow dryer   i have gone through about

marketing materials  there s definitely some valid technology that keeps your hair from frizzing out  very happy with this unit  so far  this is the best hair dryer i ve ever used  i like the hair dryer very much   my old one was really loud   this is not at all   nice color   very pleased i bought it  this hair dryer is the best we have found yet  it puts out a concentrated stream of air that is not too hot but drys your hair quickly  it has an easy to use mount for the dryer  only negative is the instructions for mounting on the wall  which are backward  but once mounted it is a joy  my wife has tried many hairdryers and i couldn t believe how satisfied she was with this hair dryer     totally worth it  hang up wall mounted hair dryer fit right in the spot the old dryer was mounted  powerful enough    i choice this particular dryer for the little knob that holds the cord up out of the way of countertop clutter   and the bonus of the night lite  i overlooked in the description online   is great for nite trips to the potty  nite lite can be shutoff if needed   it sits nice and tidy in the room  up and out of the way of countertop  excellent 100   satisfecho por la compra de

product to be able to straighten your hair out and have it look great   this blow dryer has made all the differece in how fast and nice my hair blows dries straightening out  this hair dryer works great   my first purchase broke after just two weeks  the heating element became too hot and the hairdryer shut off   my replacement however has been fine   drys hair quickly and leaves it feeling smooth and silky   it is light weight and easy to hold while styling with a brush in the other hand  i had another  blow dryer just like this one and it finally died on me   i went in search of it at all the local stores   i couldn t find it  so i bought a couple other ones that i ended up returning  because i didn t like them   therefore  i was pretty happy when i found this close match on amazon   i m very happy with it  this hairdryer worked as advertised for about 10 months    after that point  the fan stopped working and it got really hot and overheated in about a second   we ll see how good the customer service is  the hair dryer itself works pretty well  but the retractable cord is completely misleading  it stopped retracting on its own after i used it twice  with that said  the folding handle still makes it easy to store  good buy for the price  i read a lot of reviews before purchasing this  and i m glad i listened to them  this is a powerful  easy to use dryer  it gets the job done  and while i use styling products  it does help make it somewhat silky smooth  definitely recommend  love it  love it  love it     in renovating our bathrooms  we added an amenity i so

that the hair dryer is ok   i just like at picture  is not bad for the cost    is great   d the product works perfectly  other dryers suck my wifes hair into the intake  very fine hair  this dryer does not do that  when she is happy so am very happy with product   very quite operationally  it was a bit tricky to mount on the wall  but that was probably just me  very happy with product   very quite operationally  it was a bit tricky to mount on the wall  but that was probably just me  i ve bought this dryer four months ago and so far so good  it s not the best that i ve ever had  but works well for the price  i ve bought this dryer four months ago and so far so good  it s not the best that i ve ever had  but works well for the price  when i first pulled it out of the box i was surprised to find that mine at least had a sparkly finish but i decided to try it before passing any judgments on how the product works  i m happy i did  the dryer has 6 settings each tailored to a different hair type  which is great  in addition to that handy perk  it also has instant cool for setting styles  my hair is always very soft and pretty after using the dryer  glad to say that i love it  my hairdresser uses this hair dryer and i asked her about it since it always leaves my hair so impeccably styled   i went ahead and ordered it here and i m very happy with it   elchim is solid  yet lightweight  dries hair extremely fast  is surprisingly quiet   and it leaves my hair smooth and glossy   super long cord is convenient  plus its beautiful   it looks like a high performance sports car  this hair blow dryer is superior to the one i now own   i particularly like the titanium ceramic coated grill and the two concentrators   it has plenty of power  1875 watts  and is lightweight   i also find it advantageous to have 3 heat and 2 speed settings   i was not familiar with this brand  but am impressed  this product is amazing  it dries your hair really fast and allows it to be as straight or as curly as you want  this is one of the best hair dryers i have ever had  and i recommend it to everyone  this product is amazing  it dries your hair really fast and allows it to be as straight or as curly as you want  this is one of the best hair dryers i have ever had  and i recommend it to everyone  this blow dryer is great   really leaves my hair soft  shiny   frizz free   great value for the price   would highly recommend  i can t believe someone didn t think of this sooner  best product i have bought in a very long time  love having two hand to manipulate my hair how i want it  i am very pleased with the strength of hold the suction cup has on my mirror  the whole thing feels very sturdy  it is very good fan for the price  i noticed a tremendous difference in my hair even with the summer among us  the only thing that is a con is that it is not a light weight fan  otherwise i am extremely happy with my purchase  this dryer is perfect for those with medium to short length cuts  if you have a 3 foot long mane of thick  beautiful hair or a maybe pile of the dredds  forget this one  that s not the intention  wall mount is very convenient and appealing for guests  the price is good  it s easy to install and is quite functional  i purchased this dryer for a trip to italy   it worked perfectly   it has a switch so i can use it in either the usa or when i travel abroad   please note the directions read to only use on low setting when overseas  but the air volumne was still very good   i have thick hair   you will need an adaptor for it for international travel  but not a convertor   overall very good product  lightweight and durable  i use this dryer exclusively for when i color my hair with a henna because henna is heat activated   so i do not use rollers but just put the bonnet on after applying the henna   not sure why the byline says from a 12 year old reader       the high setting does a great job activating the henna  but the bonnet is so heavy that it collapses on top of my head and is so hot that it would burn if i did not hold it up manually   except since the bonnet gets too hot to touch  i attach a clothespin to it and hold the clothespin up for the 50 minutes that the henna is cooking     it may work better with rollers  but the best idea would be to make a lighter bonnet that puffs up on its own  like the one that came with the old carel dryers     when i called the manufacturer to tell them that the bonnet acts that way  they were defensive   if they could fix that problem  they d have a much better dryer  just got this and charged it overnight   used it with extreme satisfaction this morning   my teeth feel great   set up was a breeze and using it is easy   everything i hoped it would be  after getting a couple shellac manicures i decided to invest in my own home manicure set up and this light works great for doing your own nails  fits one hand or foot just fine and has 2 3 5 minute timers  i won t go past 2 minutes so don t see a need for the other two really  item was packaged well  with all 4 light bulbs  very easy to install the light bulbs and wa lah   good to go  i just could not see spending over  150 on one of these lights for home use so bought this one  it works the same as the one at my local salon with one exception   no fan  maybe that s the additional cost of the higher priced one and someday i may decide to spend that kind of money  but for a 2 minute curing this light is great  if you are into the new gel or shellac style manicures to grow your own nails long and strong it s worth the investment  you ll spend the same amount of money in 2 3 months as you will on setting up your own home manicure kit  i do feel bad for my manicurist so i ll probably still go see her for pedicures  this is by far a classic fragrance from polo   polo sport  still going strong a great classic must have from the 90 s  arrived in good condition  i ve only used the product for about 2 weeks  i haven t noticed any changes in my skin yet  i m using this as recommended in conjunction with the acquarella nail polish  it works as a clear polish  as well     the best thing about it is that it does not trigger contact dermatitis or cause nail pitting like the drug store stuff  so i m excited about that  hey guys  i have to tell ya  i have tried many nose ear trimmers  but by far the philps norelco nt9110 is the best i have ever used or bought  this philps norelco 9110 is absolutely the best  if you follow the instructions  rinse and brush it out after  every use  this product will last  who knows how long  i have had mine for 2 months now  and not a problem with anything  it dose the job of trimming my nose ear hair better than what i exspected  all i can say is  you will not be disapointed with the performance  best regards  greg   p s  thanks a lot phillps for making an exceptional product  if you want quality foundation you re going to have to pay for it  i bouught a physician s formula foundation and wow  what crap that was  their sponge they sell with the compact won t even fit in their compact           but this gabriel compact is great  the foundation is superb  this is a really nice mild smelling body wash that certainly does wonders for dry skin  love it  ordered it twice esp  at ths sale price  great pick for servicing scuba gear   use it for removing o rings   strong  not really bendable  which is good  this is really worth everything it stands for  no wonder it is a classic  it is incredible  i never bought a perfume without smelling it before this one  my god i did not regret it  this was absolutely amazing  i have curly african american 3c hair that is prone to breakage  tangling  brittleness and snapping  this makes my hair easily detangle  smells like gardenia flowers  it is a tan color with a creamy  buttery texture  it doesn t exactly make hair shine  but is great for a leave in conditioner and makes hair even curlier  i liked the price for the amount that you get of 7oz  it doesn t weigh hair down and is not oily  this is perfect for any ethnic hair type or wavy curly hair for non ethnic hair  when i put it on my hair i instantly noticed the difference  i love this and plan to buy it for as long as they make the product  what a great product  there is a little learning curve  but really application just takes a little time  you can cut the strips in half and get two applications  the most important thing to remember is to rub  rub  rub the shield on your nail  i do it while watching tv  great longevity  my nails out grew the shield  made my nails grow super fast and they are really strong  be patient  you will be glad you did  i was really impressed with the amount of rhinestones i got and the colors on

started coming out of the on off switch  so i got a good 4 years out of it     in this day and age when this product like others offer no warranty time at all i quess thats pretty good  i purchased

no warranty time at all i quess thats pretty good  overall  love the dryer  i do wish there was a hook for hanging and ultimately would love to see a medium heat setting  the dryer really does make my hair shine  good deal for the cost and the retractable cord is a a lifesaver  this is my third t3   the special edition comes with a shorter cord   this is fine for home use  in fact  it might be better not having and 8 ft cord   this blow dryer is the best i have ever used and the price is less that inferior dryers  my hair is so soft and it was so worth the money  i recommend it for anyone  also great gift idea    update i have had this item since 2011 and its still going strong  nice quality  you get what you pay for  it s efficient and the temperature options as nice  i use the diffuser all the time for my curly hair to avoid frizzing and it locks on nicely  also  the diffuser is nicely shaped so you can get it right on your scalp because it is curved  and it won t fall off all the time like it might with another brand  make sure you don t click the blue button unless you want it locked on the cold temperature    i almost thought i had a defective product because i didn t know i had clicked it by accident  otherwise it s working great so far  my 10 year old conair just died so i bought this model   so far it has been perfect   the airflow is great   i love the temperature settings with the cool shot   i mainly use the straightening attachment which is perfect   this works just as well as the  150 ones at the salon  my 10 year old conair just died so i

invention since the invention of the blow dryer itself   when folded it fits into its own carrier bag   that bag fits easily in any suitcase or briefcase  or purse if you carry one    the portability of this styler should not fool you as you have a full 1875 watts   that s a lot of power to blow and to heat   i would highly recommend this styler   oh  and i forgot to mention that the color looks

ever used  here is the review she wrote for me     the remington pearl ceramic hair dryer comes with a full line of useful features       among its better aspects  the dryer is attractive  lightweight  and marvellously quiet  it has a cool shot as well as three heat settings which get warm enough to dry hair quickly  without frying it     the dryer comes with an attached hook from which it can be hung  as well as a diffuser and a concentrator  the result is sleek  straight  or wavy hair    depending on which attachment you use  i highly recommend this dryer  i can find nothing negative to say about it     so    there ya go  its awesome   you just have to dab a little bit on your eyelid and rub it in  with your finger  i would recommend it to anyone    i bought this aftershave in california a few years ago while on holiday im from scotland and when iwear it everyone comments on it guys and girls if im in a bar or club people always ask me what im wearing and how good it smells i don t wear anything else now thank goodness  a f opened a store in the uk its an aftershave u can wear anytime love it this lovely boxed gift set arrived on time was a gift and was greatly appreciated by

being in my early 60 s  i ve been shaving a long time  having had many shavers in my life i d rate this one as a good shaver  i ve had other panasonic shavers that did work better  but cost much much more  for me the bottom line is this is a good shaver at a great price  i think this product is ok  but overpriced and there is more of the bottle than there is of the moisturizer   peter thomas roth should start lowering his prices for his products   i can buy more products cheaper than his from kohls that also do wonders for my skin and they at least  allow the consumer to use their discounts on every item including perfumes and make up      amazed no one has given thumbs up on this hair color product   naturcolor is the best permanent herbal based hair color i ve ever used   after many professional hair color mishaps  i decided to go it on my own  and that was a decade ago  when i found naturcolor at my local health market   i ve gotten many compliments on my highlights  and natural color   it doesn t strip my hair  and doesn t turn it artificially yellow   why isn t everyone using naturcolor   they should  i use sesame blond 9n on the roots  leaving it for about 20 minutes  then i put the left overs just on the top of my hair for another 5 minutes and shampoo  and i am summer blond  you ll save a lot on stylist fees and have a more natural look    susan the 3 jars are a much

lightened and are dissatisfied with brassiness  br   if you don t like the result  it s simple to wash out  it is a temporary to semi permanent color  br   i love it  ordered 2 of the 3500  but received the 3200  which was a lower model  lower priced  by mistake  somehow  i don t believe that  i feel as if they were trying to see if i would notice the difference  then when i asked for an exchange  they said they didn t have any more of the 3500s  sounds fishy to me  ordered 2 of the 3500  but received the 3200  which was a lower model  lower priced  by mistake  somehow  i don t

for home use  a long time ago  this dryer was in a favorite hotel chain   i loved being able to push it back onto the wall without stopping to turn it off first   today  there is more room on the counter with the dryer safe on the wall   the cord stays out of the sink  too  a bit heavier than most and cost a little more but but it is a whole bunch better than the cheaper ones   definitely a

a few years drying my hair will be an act of remembrance   that being said  my wife  the primary user of this  loves this   the dual heat and fan controls allows her to get just the right touch   from

it is the best one   this dryer offers all the options you need and delivers the good solid service in an almost professional manner   i find it easy to use and very effective and easy to move around   three speeds and heat levels give you every option plus it has an ionic mode as well   for the money a very good purchase  like this hair blower  however i was not too happy went i saw it at

owned  including a t3  this one dries the fastest and leaves my hair smooth not frizzed   i m not saying it s going to perform miracles and turn a rat s nest into a pantene commercial  but i use to run my straightening iron through my hair just to smooth it out a bit more  and i don t feel the need to do that anymore  this is perfect  i love that it is really strong  my hair gets dry pretty fast  i also like the 3 different intensities  my hairdresser recommended this dryer   he works in hollywood and does the hair and wigs of many ladies you have heard of   this dryer is awesome   does a great job   just don t drop it   i dropped mine one too many times and had to buy another one which i quickly did   now i put a towel in the sink and put the dryer in the sink while i m futzing with

granddaughter  i have no idea how great it is but it has been on her wish list for a long time  the service i received though was wonderful  i put this product on around 5 am before i went to school it stayed on most of the day  by around 9 pm the winged cat eye i had made with this eyeliner had faded somewhat  then when i went to remove the product i found it rather easy  even though it is supposed to be waterproof  it came off easily with a tissue and some water  i love the product though  very pigmented  this is a fabulous top coat  we use it at my cosmetology school along with opi nail polish and it s the perfect combo  definitely recommend it  i am notorious for screwing my nails up right after the hard work i put into doing them  so if you re like that    get it  this is a great price for it too  i ordered two of these and returned them immediately  the suction cups are placed too far apart and will not stay stuck on the tub when i place my head there  if this problem is rectified  it will be a good product  i have used pillows of this style for years with excellent results  these have a flaw in their design which renders them useless  i love venus dreams body chai   i have very dry skin and use body chai after showering and at night before i go to bed  i particularly like it for my feet and elbows   it is creamy  smooth  and absorbs perfectly  and the smell is divine   just right this is a teriffic product  i was seeing lines  road maps   in my face and i put the oil on after cleansing my face and then cover that with collegen cream and bingo   i could see

name and info about the hair dryer and ordered from amazon   the hair dryer is great   so good that i ordered the flat iron too   great find  i now have the ritz of hair dryers  super easy to mount  great the cord does not coil because it would get tangled easily  a tad bit noisy but that s what a hair dryer is  loud  i recommend to all  the folding handle and the retractable cord make this a great travel dryer   plenty of power and yet easy to store   definitely a good buy   have used it for about 6 months and works great  br   2013   still going strong  the retractable cord is not

have had   matter of fact  maybe not as good   it does not have the blowing power that my   revlon has  and is not any lighter   i don t know what all the hype is about this one   save your money and get a  30 one  i found out they are just as good  great compact design  i love the cord hanger  the light is pretty bright  but exactly as advertised  it does take longer to dry my hair but it is

using the loving naturals sunscreen lotion for my 15 month old and decided to try out the stick  initial reaction  love it  i love loving naturals  products because they are made of safe organic ingredients which is exactly what i want for my baby s sensitive skin  it contains almost 25  zinc oxide which is what our doctor recommended to look for as the active ingredient as this is the best protection from the sun   we love the lotion  but the stick is great for keeping in your purse diaper bag  i carry it with me everywhere just in case we do an inpromptu play session outside and i love

chair  i found the cushion works best when used in a recliner  this is the next best thing to a massaging chair  i found the cushion works best when used in a recliner  my husband loves this product  although i accidentally way overpaid for this which upsets me  the product is great and lasts a long time   he has used it many times before and it smells good  too   next time just get it directly from burts bees retailer website where you can easily get it for cost   you don t have to get it from amazon s private dealers  which can way overcharge for things  i have achieved healthy looking non frizzy hair by rubbing this oil over my hands and cuticles  and then running my hands through my hair  a little of this stuff goes a long way  i also love that this product has no fragrance  it is practically odorless  which makes it ok to use around my chemically sensitive mother  its a great product  would buy it again  have only used once but have high expectations   smell was not really so great but not horrible   the after tan smell  that burnt hair smell  was not bad at all   so well worth it there   i could still smell it but it wasnt overpowering like most lotions are   gave me good color right out of the bed but not the best  br    br   i still think worship me does a much better job giving you color right out of the bed   i looked like a goddess of the islands after using that just once   also worship me smells better   but meh  i ll try this and see  br    br   hope it works    if you love vanilla  you will love this essential oil  i m glad i bought this at first i was kind of scared to get one of these for cheap  bc i m scared to get cut  but fortunately this price is great  and it works fantastic  i love it    and it comes with 10 replacement blades  it s a great

placed 3 weeks ago for the same product through beautydepot  haire supplies is a very professional business who will continue to have my business from now  amazon is just great with whatever you order  they know who to do business with  i haven t seen any of the great skin improvements that are supposed to come with a clarisonic  but i do feel as though my face is very  very clean when i m done using it  and that s a good enough reason to have it in my book  this color is awesome  you won t find any like it  it s a very sweet almost turquoise green  i have had a lot of compliments on it  br

very nice product  quality is quite good  and save you from risk of missing pills    very handy and portable i received this product and enjoyed using this   i was expecting a quicker result   it wasn t a miracle worker for me   beth i received this product and enjoyed using this   i was expecting a quicker result   it wasn t a miracle worker for me   beth i bought this product because i have the hair serum  which i liked also  and smells nice   i tried the shampoo today and being that today is an extremely humid day  the product held up nicely   my hair had no tangles and smells so pretty   i will purchase this again   when i began shampooing i felt my hair was not feeling dry and all tangled like some others i ve tried  and i ve tried all the well known ones   it felt soft and shiny   kind of silky  this is okay but i m not fond of the smell   there is another bhringraj hair oil on amazon that smells way better and leaves your hair soooo soft  i felt compelled to write this review because my wife nagged me   she says its a really good bra strap concealer     i took 1 star off beacuse of the high price  in my mind  these should go for like  4 99    comes in pack of 6  i took one for use with my pc s cable management  great scent that isn t too sweet but not too woodsy either  some are turned off by the fact that it s made by the famous womens bridal designer  but in reality  she knows how to make a man smell amazing  i love this scent and have been wearing it for three years  first time to buy it from amazon and the process was a breeze with fast shipping  this is a marvelous shave   nothing else that i have ever used is anywhere near as comfortable  use it with a gel lather and you will never ever again feel the discomfort of razor burn no matter how hard you work  or workout  and prespire   ever    i discovered this wonderful mint leaf soap at the home of a friend  and was very happy to find it available at amazon  great value and i will buy it again  i

the home of a friend  and was very happy to find it available at amazon  great value and i will buy it again  i bought this for my mom who had been looking for shalimar bar soap for ever   glad i found it online   it is so scrumptious smelling  i bought this for my mom who had been looking for shalimar bar soap for ever   glad i found it online   it is so scrumptious smelling  finally  a nail file that does the job the first time   i had tried cheaper glass nail files  revlon  and the abrasive surface wore off and it no longer worked   the opi file works great and has lasted   i just reordered more as gifts   try it  my mother is allergic to both amonia and peroxide  she has been using this product for more than 6 months without any allergic reactions the color stays in longer than some of the similar products she previously used  we have had problems finding this product in stores so purchasing online is an excellent option and saves a whole bunch of time in trying to find it   the package was received before the estimated time stated on amazon which i also think is excellent  this toap coat saves my life  every time i feel disappointed by a nail polish  i put one coat of orly glosser and it s like a new polish  it gives a very clean and bright finish to all kind of shades and textures  it makes the nail very shiny and smooth  br   i protects from the wear and tear as well  but i think there is better out there if this is the only reason you re wanting a top coat  however if you want a top coat that brings the best of your polish  this is it  easy to use  transport and fast  great buy    a must now for my bathroom  i have beenn using the samsara cologne and body cream for years   amazon had it at a really great price and i was glad i could find it here   i love this fragrance in the winter months and the fall   it s not heavy at all   it had a woodsy fragrance and reminds me of winter   i love it  i like this product for everyday use  it wears well and does show results  i wasnt blown away by the volume  and i would have liked this in waterproof  but al in all  for the price it was great  a mite spicy  a little woodsy  a bit floral  a touch exotic  a hint of warm     basically perfect     seems like every time i leave the house with this scent on  someone moves in closer  inhales and then asks me what i m wearing     and i m middle aged and chubby  so it s not a move    it s just the scent     can be over powering if over done  but with a light hand this one is just right  good product   strange delivery in that it is shipped in more than one box  i am very picky when it comes to my blow dryers  i can t commit  my sister had purchased this item at target and i loved it  it has great power for it not being a professional hair dryer  i searched for it at 3 targets and found out they no longer carried it  i was browsing on amazon and found it  i ordered it immediately  i am very happy i purchased this item  i am very picky when it

lot   doesn t promote breakouts  and is also a sunscreen   it s great  i must say  i was at the beginning skeptical of trying this soap  i went to the beauty supply and right before my eyes  i saw dudu osun     i decided to try it out because of the great reviews  i spent  4 99 1 bar   and can say honestly that every penny was worth wild  this makes my skin feel soooo refreshed soft and clean  dudu osun has an earthy smell  and is pleasant to my sences       my skin is brighter  cleaner  and my dark spots has lightened after 2 uses  i will most definitely purchase more of this soap and will use it as a bath soap as well  just wanted to add that i also purchased  100  pure shea butter ghana   and i love this as a moisturizer after using dudu osun  and these two are a great combination together  my skin looks flawless       this floss is the kind recommended by my dentist and i can t find it in stores anywhere   target used to have it but not recently   decently priced online  and good service on delivery  great shaver but all the shavings fall out and little stays in the shaving head area  very pleased with the product and with amazon s system  found the dryer we wanted  paid a reasonable price   and received it quickly  attached it to the wall easily and found it to work exactly as we wanted  handy product for b   bs and for those who get up in the middle of the night since it has a night light  this product has been awesome so far  it dries my hair quicker than regular dryers  love it  i was traveling on business and came across this hair dryer at the hotel   i literally ordered one from my hotel room  immediately after using the dryer   works really well  love the fact that it folds up and has a retractable cord   great space saver  i was traveling on business and came across this hair dryer at the hotel   i literally ordered one from my hotel room  immediately after using the dryer   works really well  love the fact that it folds up and has a retractable cord   great space saver  this drier gives me another proof that how amazon com helps me find the best product     simple design  great quality  compact form factor  for  14 you simply cannot find a better one  i never knew a blowdryer could be this wonderful  i should have invested in it years ago and saved all that money on straighteners and fancy products that i bought to compensate for crappy blowdryers  now i know  i never knew a blowdryer could be this wonderful  i should have invested in it years ago and saved all that money on straighteners and fancy products that i bought to compensate for crappy blowdryers  now i know  i never knew a blowdryer could be this wonderful  i should have invested in it years ago and saved all that money on straighteners and fancy products that i bought to compensate for crappy blowdryers  now i know  i never knew a blowdryer could be this wonderful  i should have invested in it years ago and saved all that money on straighteners and fancy products that i bought to compensate for crappy blowdryers  now i know  i ordered this dryer specifically for the diffuser shown in the picture  instead of the diffuser  it came with a cheap hair brush that you could purchase at a dollar store     excellent little dryer  but i would caution you that the high setting does not work in europe  this is a cool and very light blow dryer  its light and its light and its very light  its may be not as powerful as some blow dryers but its pretty strong and yes its very light the best hair dryer i ve ever used  cut my drying time in half and i have a lot of hair  this hair dryer is smaller than i expected however i am impressed  the sound is not that ear pearcing scream small hair dryers make  the air flow and options are ideal  this hair dryer is quiet and does a good job  we bought it because we liked the ones at motels and timeshares we had seen and wanted one like them  the night light is quite bright almost too bright for us   the air flow is quiet and does a good job but does not offer separate heat  air controls  overall we are pleased with it  this hair dryer seemed to perform ok for a few months  but then it caught on fire   seems like manufacturers of electrical appliances could prevent fires   just good thing my wife didn t get burned in the process  unlike other stretchers  this one will only widen your shoes  not make them longer   this isn t made clear in the description   it s still well made and i was creative enough to make it work  but if you re looking to stretch a shoe length wise this probably isn t your best option  i bought this razor for my dad who decided to switch to electric shaving at age 97   it works really great for him  shaves beautifully and is well designed   you will not be disappointed with this shaver  this product was in good condition when i received it  shipping was nominal  thank you  this product was in good condition when i received it  shipping was nominal  thank you  this product was in good condition when i received it  shipping was nominal  thank you  this product gave me definite results unlike many products where it s a gradual color  after one application  i look like i ve spent a day at the beach which is exactly what i wanted to achieve  it s not greasy or sticky which is great  it dries quickly  no annoying scent  you must wear gloves  fairly easy to apply and looks even   great product   i m sold  these pony tail holders are a good strong weight to hold my heavy hair without breaking hair  the item arrived in 3 days from across the country  it is just a described  good quality  this store is so great because they don t charge shipping fee  other web sites charged a fee equal to or even more than the cost of the product  i recommend this store and the product  product is a nice beigey gloss cannot find it in the stores anymore so i came to amazon product is a nice beigey gloss cannot find it in the stores anymore so i came to amazon i love this little blow dryer   it drys my hair super fast  light weight  is up and out of the way   and a great price   buy more than one  and give as a gift   i bought this hair dryer a couple of months ago and really love it   i had read the reviews about the cord not being a spiral stretch cord and that is why i bought this one   i have a linen closet next to my vanity and there is a plug in inside the closet   i hang the dryer in there out of sight so when i take it out to use  it has a much longer cord then a spiral cord and i need the extra length to reach my vanity so it works perfect for me   so if you are looking for the spiral cord do not buy this unit  but if you need a longer cord this is the one for you  i was needing a hair dryer that wouldn t throw the breaker when on high and this one is good although it did blow breaker one time but i had too many things going at the time but it hasn t happened since  it is handy to hold and turn on and off or adjust settings with one hand so this is a keeper for me  i spent over  100 for a hairdryer   i used it twice and had to return it because it had no heat   i wasn t impressed for over  100  it does everything it says it will   nice drying  not too hot  very even  and the attachments work well   the heat is very even and it does a good job   this is kind of a cadillac of hair dryers for people who want to pamper their hair   i love it  peroxyl isn t available where i live  the shipment was slower than i expected but arrived at the end of the promised time frame  the product is excellent for gum problems and was recommended by my dentist  it shouldn t be used without a dentist s approval  this eyeliner is the best  it s truly waterproof and yet not flaky  creates a nice solid black line and is very controllable with that nice pointy tipped applicator  br   love it    my boy does not like when i put any cream on his face  he does not mind mustela dermo pediatrics stelaprotect  skin is so smooth and smells lovely  i can only recommend it  i had purchased this item years ago at an origins store  not even noticing the brand name  i wanted to replace it and when i saw this on amazon i was thrilled  this is such a great handy thing to use for lotion  my husband hates me asking him to lotion my back  so this is great  and washable which i love  i also use an oil for sore back muscles sometimes and i can use this to apply it myself  great item  i have avon s haiku perfume and i absolutely love it  i received the powder as a gift and it s the same wonderful scent  i have not purchased from this seller  so that s all up you  those of you who worry about the  shimmer  as the others state  it is very very light  to be honest  i just started using the powder

  purchase it  mine came yesterday and it is perfect   i was looking for a lighted magnifying mirror that would wall mount and i didn t want to pay an arm and a leg for it   this was under  60 and it is all i could ask for   i bought the chrome   it really does the job   thanks for providing such a superior product at such a great price  this simply felt like a lighter petroleum jelly and was in a tube  been using it for a week and notice no difference  easily wears off in five minutes  clinique s lip scrub made my lips feel better  i bought this dryer because my hairdresser has one like it   i have naturally curly hair that i straighten  this dryer is awesome   it dries hair quicker than most  leaving no frizz in the hair   my hair feels smoother and healthier after using it   i would recommend this product to everyone   some of the reviews that i read on here before purchasing  said that a lot of people didn t like the controls because their hand would hit it and just turn it off  i don t understand this  if you hold it in your hand the right way  it works fine without hitting the controls  this product is of good quality for a very good price  also  lightweight and not too noisy  this product is of good quality for a very good price  also  lightweight and not too noisy  this product is of good quality for a very good price  also  lightweight and not too noisy  i bought this product almost 3 years ago   it is so nice to be hands free and feel confident it will stick to the counter  or glass    i recently bought it as a gift for my mom   she loves it  i saw this at my sister in laws  she has one in each bathroom and loved it  its out of the way and always neat looking  it has lots of power for no bigger than it is and just a nice addition to my bathroom  convenient but out of the way also  power cord is long enough but not too long  love it  love it  love it   i bought this hair dryer as a christmas present for my girlfreind   she says its the best hair dryer she has ever owned   i highly recommend  excellent dryer leaves hair puffy and doesnt feel damaged best dryer i have ever used  excellent dryer leaves hair puffy and doesnt feel damaged best dryer i have ever used  excellent dryer leaves hair puffy and doesnt feel damaged best dryer i have ever used  excellent dryer leaves hair puffy and doesnt feel damaged best dryer i have ever used  bought as xmas gift for wife  matched the 1600 kw of our previous andis blow dryer   but it lacked the blowing power alot  the light was also very bright on the wall mount  had we kept it i was going to remove the light  did not meet our expectations  so i returned the item to amazon  this is a great dryer for curlie hair   don t forget to clean the filter   i did and the dryer stopped working   so now  i purchased need a new one  this is a great hairdryer for the price   dries my hair quickly  is lighweight  and easy to use   i bought two   one for my wife and one for me   she likes it as much as i do   great purchase  this is a great hairdryer for the price   dries my hair quickly  is lighweight  and easy to use   i bought two   one for my wife and one for me   she likes it as much as i do   great purchase  we used this hair dryer in a hotel once and loved it so much we have one in ever bathroom  7  in the house     we live at the beach so when we have company they use the hair dryers and they love them    two of our friends liked them so much they bought one for their houses         don t waste your money buying the hair dryer with the night light  the light won t last long  just buy this one it s the best         okay  how could i have lived 63years and never thought of installing a hair dryer on the wall   it s a no brainer   dragging out the hairdryer every day and trying to put it away neatly is a hassle and there is no reason to put up with it any longer   i bought 2 oster 76932 710 and put one up in my bathroom and the other in the spare bath   now when guests come over they compliment me for the nice hotel upgrade   everybody comments on what a good idea     the 710 watt oster is a great dryer and does the job well on my thick hair   the dryer snaps easily in and out of the holder   it took me about 30 minutes to install both dryers   and that included the time it took me to find my drill and try and read 3 16 on the drill bit   buy this   it will only make you happy  none available  i have tried a lot of hair dryers in the last 40 years  this one is  by far  the best i have used  it is pricier than the ones you see in the discount stores  but it is worth every penny you pay for it  i recommend it highly  i ve had mine for a year and a half  it still works great  turned out to be a great purchase  br   3 17 2013 it s been over 3 years and it still works like new  after years of having my hair dryer clutter up the vanity  i now have a very nice dryer attached to the wall   be sure to have near plug in as the cord is short   love this for organization  and it works very well  i purchased this rigid cover hair dryer for my wife   she is very pleased with the results   it works well for her  i purchased this rigid cover hair dryer for my wife   she is

bought this as a gift for my daughter who is in nursing school  she loves anything that is pink and has the breast cancer logo  she said this is the best dryer she has ever had dries her hair in half the time  she said she loves it and that it is a great dryer  couldn t be more impressed with a blow dryer  the color jumps right out at you  the 2 speeds are average and the heat options work great  heats up really fast   on high is probably too hot for some  have medium short hair  so no need for attachments  but i m sure they would function well if you need them  can t say enough about the

of compliments on how shiny my hair is since i started using it  this is a great product  if it can be quieter and smaller  it will be an even better item for home users  dual voltage perfect for

was going to weeks so i had to cancel it and get a refund   bummer  i also first tried this product while on vacation   this little hair dryer is compact  light  and powerful   the best part  however

performance       tops st  louis this is an excellent blow dryer  i read the reviews before purchasing about how it didn t work right out of the box  same thing happened to me  except that i realized

delay  i love this dryer  it is fast and relatively quiet  i have had great hair days ever since i bought this  since my hair dryers only seem to last a year or so  i am buying a couple extras as backup  i think this is the best hair dryer that i have ever owned  wow  i searched and searched for a good blow dryer and decided upon this one  it was the best decision  i am a professional so i have to have a sturdy blow dryer and this one is that and more  it dries the hair in about 3 4 minutes including long hair  with no frizz  i love it and would buy another one in a heartbeat  love hairdryer  my hair is in great shape since switching to it  the only thing that i wish it had was a hot warm setting in addition to the high low we had these in our old home and left them so as not to disturb the wallpaper   we were so happy to find them again and they discounted  10 for buying two  that s so great  it is awesome not to have to look for your hairdryer and put it away each time  we had these in our old home and left them so as not to disturb the wallpaper   we were so happy to find them again and they discounted  10 for buying two  that s so great  it is awesome not to have to look for your hairdryer and put it away each time  it does not heat as well as i think it should  barely adequate and would not purchase again  this was a great deal this is very light weight does get a little bit too hot for me  only has a high and low not a heat option    definetly drys my hair in record time  has a great long cord  great dryer for the price can t believe i was able to get it for such a great price   this is my 2nd t3 dryer   this one is so much lighter   love it   mounting was very easy  the hairdryer looks sleek   modern  works efficiently  i m very happy with it  mounting was very easy  the hairdryer looks sleek   modern  works efficiently  i m very happy with it  i tried this in a recent hotel stay and had to order one for myself at home   the dryer has a retractable cord which is nice and it drys your hair quickly and without frizz  great product great product great product the hair drier is as it was described  the price was really good and my daughter and her long hair are very pleased with the drier  br    br   the united states parcel post took 22 days to deliver it   it would be worth spending an extra bit of change to get a faster delivery  my daughter was getting scared of the hair dryer so we tried this one and she loves   in addition it s probably the best hair dryer we ve owned in recent memory and my wife wants one too now  this is one of the best hair dryers i ve ever had    i recommend it 100   and it s worth every penny    this is one of the best hair dryers i ve ever had    i recommend it 100   and it s worth every penny    this is a wonderful hair dryer   so great to be out of the way on the counter     would have given 5 stars  but it was somewhat difficult to install   the screws supplied were too small and the unit wobbled on the wall   we purchased new  longer screws and fixed the issue      it is in our quest bedroom and i m sure will be a wonderful welcome to out of town quests   just like a hotel   its light weight and i love the new technology   it s very good for colored treated hair  i was looking for a wall mount hair dryer and came up with the andis read the reviews and decided that this dryer was for me in the 2nd bathroom so the night light helps and is not in anyway visable until you get into the hallway  great hair dryer would highly recomend this one            i have always felt that conair makes the best dryers   it is quiet and drys your hair quickly   nice black color   lightweight  i used another brand for years   and i replaced them every few months   never held up   i have limited space in the bathroom and love the retractable cord and folding handle styles for that reason   i discovered this andis brand version at a hotel  five star  and searched it out and found it at amazon   i m very happy with it     it has already outlasted the conair versions   only reason i didn t give it five stars is for a ceramic ionic dryer   it leaves hair quite frizzy   if you need the compactedness of this dryer    it s the best one around  this is the second conair 204p hair dryer that i ve owned  and it is truly the best hair dryer i ve seen   it is small  yet powerful   in addition  it is quiet   i am so glad to have found it  as it came out in stores a number of years ago   i feel especially pleased that a portion of my purchase goes to breast cancer awareness   thank you  amazon  replacement for the first one  which had the fan blade fly apart during use   cheap plastic fan blade where metal would be much better   it was out of warranty  and because i took the case apart to check for the problem  they would neither fix it or sell me the part to repair it   since i now have one for parts other than the fan  and the hair dryer fit so well where i had it hung  i went ahead and bought another one   it is a good design  but the quality could be better when it comes to that fan   no problem with anything else  just that cheap plastic fan blade  in my case anyway  i bought 5 of these  with nightlight  to put in each bathroom of my home   i find the light is a useful addition and can be turned off by clicking the test button on the power cord   the dryer is powerful  not extremely noisy  and appears to be of good quality contruction  over the years of working in salons  my own included  i have had many dryers  i like working with this as it is extremely light weight and dries the hair very fast and almost frizz free  excellant product for the professional stylist while only moderately useful for drying my short hair  i loaned this to my fiance to check it out and she said it was great  she used to have a very expensive hair dryer and said that this one worked just as well  of course  everyone s hair is different but the important thing is that the temperature is good and with the optional diffuser attachment  there are more options depending on your hair style  male or female  this is a great product at a good price and the quality seems very good at this price point as well  works well   glad i bought it   the cord keeper is certainly a nice feature and the bright color makes it easy to find under my bathroom cabinet  works well   glad i bought it   the cord keeper is certainly a nice feature and the bright color makes it easy to find under my bathroom cabinet  excellent product  compact and powerful with ion generator and cool green nightlight  led   nice design   built in ground fault protection and thoughtful cord hook  very easy to mount and fairly quiet in operation  especially on low speed  andis 30130 hangup 1600w wall mount hair dryer

read the review in in style and my prior conair hair dryer had died   it works great and i love the retractable cord  quick delivery  used dryer in great shape  the mrs  is hard to please when it comes to hair care products  another great product from conair and another safe and enjoyable transaction with the big a way to go amazon i love the way this dryer works   it s not so powerful that it blows the hair all over the place but it s ionic feature makes my hair feel so much thicker and i love the nightlight  too  this wall mounted unit was easy to install  has plenty of power and eliminates all the bother of storage and cord untangling of a portable unit  the automatic shutoff feature works great  the unit has 2 speeds  however the high speed is normally used  great service  shipped and arrived on time  have used the product before and am satisfied with it  great service  shipped and arrived on time  have used the product before and am satisfied with it  fantastic product  i feel like i m in a hotel when i shower  the price was incredible also  fantastic product  i feel like i m in a hotel when i shower  the price was incredible also  this is a great product and the price half of what you would pay at a salon  good  handy little hair dryer that i can keep in a drawer at the bathroom sink   i m a head shaver so i only needed this for my son  occasionally  and for guests   works great  this ion shine hair dryer is great  especially for my hair  which is very fine  the wattage is great for fine hair and it has high low and warm hot settings  it also has the cool shot button which i love  the ion technology is really nice  i have noticed that my hair is very soft after using it and my split ends are practically non existent  the buttons do take some getting used to but totally worth it   love  love  love this hairdryer   it delivers what it promises and the fact that you push a button and the cord retracts inside the handle is a definite plus for neat storage  my wife seems to like the dryer and her looks great   she says its faster her only comment is that there is no high warm only a high hot     its a great product for a good price hopefully it will last the test of time   according to the other reviews  you can t return it to the manufacturer when purchased on amazon     so far so good   has everithing i was waiting for  it s a valuable item  sincerely i am very happy with this product has everithing i was waiting for  it s a valuable item  sincerely i am very happy with this product has everithing i was waiting for  it s a valuable item  sincerely i am very happy with this product has everithing i was waiting for  it s a valuable item  sincerely i am very happy with this product my old conair died so i read all the reviews and decided on this hairdryer   very satisfied   the weight is good  the attachments are fine  and the price was right   you don t need anything better   i really like the ability to open the cover to get to the mesh filter to clean it and the 3 heat settings and 3 blower settings  a winner  for its price  it is a good deal  dries hair nicely and quickly  the ion feature works   it makes the hair shinier and less frizzy  overall a good investment to manage your hair  i love this dryer   it dries your hair faster as it claims and is light weight for holding   so far so good  works great   easy to use   not too noisy   ample air flow   ionic is a recent buzzboard that proposes this technology reduces frizzies   i don t see a difference compared to old school hair dryer  i ve been using an andis prostyle 1600 hair dryer for 10 or more years   for me it is perfect   the most important feature for me is that i can drop the heat 1 setting and still keep the fan on high   it is light weight  blows lots of air  and is inexpensive   mine is still going strong  but i m buying a backup to replace it for when it dies  as all hairdryers eventually do  my wife loves this blow dryer so much that she wanted me to buy one for our daughter too  excellent price for excellent product  my wife loves this blow dryer so much that she wanted me to buy one for our daughter too  excellent price for excellent product  my wife loves this blow dryer so much that she wanted me to buy one for our daughter too  excellent price for excellent product  my sister had a hair dryer just like this one and it broke  she had purchased it at target but it was no longer available  i found it on amazon and bought it for her  it was just what she was looking for  bought the hairdryer for my wife  she was very happy with the performance   when i went to register the product i couldn t because the sticker on the box that has the serial   was missing  i then found out through amazon that they are not a authorized reseller therefore company won t honor warranty if something happens  this dryer works great  it provides a nice heat and it even has a lint collector that can be taken off to clean this dryer works great  it provides a nice heat and it even has a lint collector that can be taken off to clean excellent product   reasonably quiet  size is good and price is super for a product of this quality excellent product   reasonably quiet  size is good and price is super for a product of this quality i have had four of these wall mounted hair dryers and love them  they are up and out of the way and stay pretty much un noticable  no fiddling with on off buttons and looking for a place to store it   if one leaves the on switch on and hangs it up  it goes off and returns to the blowing setting as soon as one lifts it again  this is great  on a scale of 1 10 this item scores 11  it works well   blows a lot of air and it is not too hot  it does sometimes pull my hair into it and then it emits a burning smell   i like how light it is to hold as well   i would recommend it  i purchased this for my sister  who has long  naturally curly and somewhat frizzy hair   she also has cerebral palsy so needed a dryer that was lightweight   this one fit the bill  she loved it on the first use   her hair was smooth   shiny and the dryer works great   a great value  it is very handy  does a good job drying my hair  i liked it so well i bought a second one for the other bathroom  this is by far the best blow dryer i have ever owned   i used to swear by the chi but this one is not even comparable   very happy with it  this is by far the best blow dryer i have ever owned   i used to swear by the chi but this one is not even comparable   very happy with it  this is by far the best blow dryer i have ever owned   i used to swear by the chi but this one is not even comparable   very happy with it  i m really happy with this product  my hair is much smoother and feels healthier  i would definitely recommend this item  but couldn t imagine paying full price for it  a  300 hairdryer would have to come with it s own stylist to be worth it  if you enjoy the convenience of a wall mounted air dryer when you travel    why not have the same at home   this mounted unit keeps my sink area uncluttered  it is attractive   works well and out of the way  wouldn t pay full retail for it  because i personally can not afford to pay full retail but i believe it s safe to say that this is absolutly one of the best if not the best hairdryer out there  very pretty with the jewel studded handle  powerful light quiet and pretty much does everything it claims to do  i can easily see how this can be a favorite of the worlds top stylists  at the price i got it for on amazon website i am very pleased  you won t be dissappointed with it  have not bought a new hair dryer in years and was quite happy with this purchase  this dryer was very cheap but not cheap made  it works alot better then i expected very good buy  i would recommend  this andis 30970  was a wonderful purchase   good size  good heat temperature  easy to install and the cord hanger goes on either the right or left side   i have had other wall mounted dryers  they were hard to hang  the andis was up in a matter of minutes  she asked for a colorful hairdryer to take back to texas a and m  this one has a beautiful glittery finish  while also being a very good one  she rally did like it  she asked for a colorful hairdryer to take back to texas a and m  this one has a beautiful glittery finish  while also being a very good one  she rally did like it  it looks good  light in weight  very powerful  makes my hair shine   these new tourmaline ceramic dryers are not always what they advertise to be  but this dryer is everything it says it is and more   it cost a little more  but it is worth every penny  very nice dryer  larger sized travel  nice power   doesn t frizz my hair like my old dryer did  happier with a full sized travel than the compact ones    dries hair faster   without the frizz  as a woman with long hair  i need a good hair dryer that is easy to move around my head  this one fills the bill  with a retractable cord it makes for eash storage  it also dries hair quickly and is easy to use with your styling brushes  on a recent trip one of our hotels had this dryer in the room and my wife liked it so much i ordered one   now it s her favorite  this hair dryer has a large hood so i can use fat curlers   it is easy to set up and is not as noisy as some dryers i have used   it is light weight and very stable when set up  it is a great product for the price  i used this product in a hotel on vacation  i loved it so much  that is why i purchased this one  it is a fabulous hair dryer  a must have for freezy curly  unruly hair  makes blow drying a breeze i purchased one about 12 years ago   still going strong i use it every day also for touch ups  so i ve decided to get a new one for my daughter that will graduate college just in case she decides to move out       fairly light right price and combined with amazon service and reliability         priceless  go for it  you will not regret it  we ve owned one of these before and loved it   it hangs on the wall in our bathroom so it s always handy   when the first one broke my wife had to go back to the bulky old one she had until i found this on amazon  easiest way to make a wife happy  this is a great hair dryer  i love the retractable cord and the folding handle    makes it great for travel  the 1875 watts of power dry the wet hair quickly and i don t have any frizz problems  other hair dryers don t seem to put out as much hot air so i really like this one for the nice blast of heated air  i ve not had any problems with the cord and it s lightweight and easy to maneuver  br   recommended  i m blown away  literally   this is the best hair dryer i ve ever owned  compact  powerful  super light weight  dual voltage

love it  this is our third oster wall hair dryer   we ve used them in hotels while on business trips and thought it would be great to have one at home       we love these hair dryers because they are easy to use and efficient   we don t have to reach under the bathroom sink to pull it out every morning or find a place to plug it in without bumping into anything else on the counter   it takes up very little space on the wall and is very easy to install  i have owned several of these over the years and think they are one of the best dryers i have used  they don t have a lot of bells and whistles  just hi and lo settings   but if you want a light and powerful dryer that doesn t take up a lot of room  this is it  also like the very compact size of this unit  you won t get arm cramps trying to hold this while drying  the wall mount is a nice feature  install was easy and quick  loved the extra little arm to hang up the excess cord   night light is really bright  i mean really bright    i think it s quiet   as in the lable is because of the lower speed  of the blower  motor  i prefer more air moving  dryer does a good job all in all  arrived promptly  packaged well   and

hotel   i love the way it doesn t use a lot of heat   i also loved the way my hair looked after using this product  the ends of my hair did not look fried   after seaching the internet  i found that amazon had  what i determined  to be the most reasonable price  this dryer is worth the money   i ve been using cheaper hair dryers for years and finally opened the wallet and invested in a professional quality one   i don t notice that this dries my hair any faster  but it is shinier  smoother  and seems to have more body   for someone who has hair that has all the body and styleability of dental floss  this is a huge improvement   i like this hair dryer and i got a great price for it on amazon  this hairdryer works great i do not see any shine diffrence in my hair though transaction

the retractable cord is a great feature and keep the cords protected so that it doesn t get tangled  split  or caught up with other appliance cords     i like this hair dryer   but my old one  see link below  had a very nice feature that you could not only retract the cord  but also fold the handle up which was perfect for storage and traveling       asin b000bfjj7e conair 1875 watt ionic cord keeper hair dryer   i blow dry my hair every morning after my shower  works great    light weight in my hand    great dryer quite  does the job  the best dryer i have ever used  my hair is very curly and it gets it straight with out much work  pros  many attachments  price is good  attractive  dries quickly  no damage     cons  so heavy to use and that factor alone is enough to cancel out any of the pros   the weight is also unbalanced  so when you grip the handle in the place that best balances it out  you wind up hitting buttons   the attachments fly off and hit you in the head midstream  especially the diffuser    not recommended   you can do better  works great and fast too  design is easy to handle and manages my medium length hair without tangling  hair damp to dry in less than 20 mins  great value  i was not too sure about this with all the other reviews  but i bought it anyway  well i m so glad i did  this works great for me  i have medium hair about shoulder length  i put it on medium and it dried my hair with curlers  it never shut off  in fact it was a bit warm  i don t know if the other people got defective ones  but mine works just fine  good luck to anyone else who buys it  great hairdryer   we used one in a marriott property and my wife liked it so much i found it on line and we ordered it that day   quieter than many other models we have had and feels sturdier   does not fold up  so if you want to travel  you might want something else   but for home use  it does great  i ve owned many hairdryers over the years   they seem to last a year or so then die a quick and sometimes painful death   none has been anything to get excited about   i decided to take a chance on the farouk deep brilliance  based on the great reviews  great price  and the farouk name   some may be put off by the bright orange color  but mine gets stowed in a cabinet  so it s not a decorative accessory  the quality is outstanding and hopefully will be around more that a year or two   even more impressive is the way it styles may hair   i have short hair and the high setting dries my hair in no time   i love the lower setting for styling with my round brush   it still provides plenty of heat to set the curve  but the air velocity doesn t blow my hair off the brush   my hair looks much shinier but with lots of volume   fantastic  i love this product   my hairdresser told me to buy it and i couldn t be happier  i love this product   my hairdresser told me to buy it and i couldn t be happier  this is the last time i order anything but books thru amazon   i have a major probelm every time   i ordered the featherweight dryer with a diffuser   instead i got the special edition with no diffuser for more money   there was no contact information on the order    no phone number    i called amazon and got no help at all   i had to spend more money to order the diffuser   so i ended up spending more money and did not get the product i ordered through the amazon site  definitely a good product and i believe in conair quality and realiability  but this hair dryer is little bulkier  otherwise it works great  we got this for a trip and it was great because it had a folding handle and retractable cord  made packing super easy  it got real hot and i recommend it for anybody that needs a great dryer  we got this for a trip and it was great because it had a folding handle and retractable cord  made packing super easy  it got real hot and i recommend it for anybody that needs a great dryer  it looks great on the wall  but just isn t very powerful  takes much longer to dry my hair  wish i had known  delivered promtly after my order  works as advertised but a bit noisy  overall rating  good product works fine and installs easily   but you should make sure that you have an outlet and a place to mount the dryer that allows the cord to reach the outlet and the dryer to reach your head  with the cord from the dryer only about six feet when fully extended  finding that perfect spot is not necessarily as simple as you might think  hair dryer works great  br   mounting plate was a little bit tricky to install though   could have a better design  br   all in all  a satisfactory purchase  i read all the reviews and decided to give this hair dryer a chance since it was such a great price  i have to say that it s lighter then the one i had before and it s super quiet and i don t feel like i have to use ear plugs just to dry my hair  it dries my hair quickly  i thought about getting an ionic dryer but my hair dresser said that it really wouldn t make a difference  i m very happy with this dryer and i m going to buy one for my mom  this was an excellent buy and a great product   i saved around  20 00 as compared to discount stores in my area   the

hotel on vacation and loved it so much i had to order one for home as soon as i got back   doesn t have a separate selector for temperature  and seems to be hotter on the higher setting that the lower ones  but it works just great for me   would definitely recommend  this is a great deal  it heats up quick  the shape it blows is perfect  who dries in a circle  not i  easy to handle and can be stroked like a brush  best part  intake screen is an ease to clean  worth every penny  this is a great deal  it heats up quick  the shape it blows is perfect  who dries in a circle  not i  easy to

suppose to be one of the best out there  this dryer works well and was very easy to install  directions were very clear and it is now anchored firmly on the wall  turns off automatically when dryer is put back in holder  this is a nice feature  all in all  very nice product  none available  this is a great hair dryer  it works fast and my hair has never looked better  i never thouht i would spend that much on a dryer  but it has been well worth it       i almost didn t get it because of the reviews on here about unauthorized dealers and whatnot  it was a great price though so i went ahead anyway  i m glad i did  i don t know if somethng changed  or if those reviewers were just looking in the wrong place for the serial number  but mine had everything needed in order to register it with no problems  this wall mounted hair dryer is so nice    i also have the sunbeam 1500 but i prefer this one   it easily comes off the cradle  it is fairly quiet  compared to the sunbeam  and the design is just more user friendly   spend the extra few bucks on this one   it s a great product  im very happy with this dryer it is just as good as my chi dryer the shipping was very fast the price was excellent i would highly recommend this dryer  im a hairdresser and everyone i work with was intersted in it when they saw the color of it it really works just as good as my old chi dryer  im very happy with this dryer it is just as good as my chi dryer the shipping was very fast the price was excellent i would highly recommend this dryer  im a hairdresser and everyone i work with was intersted in it when they saw the color of it it really works just as good as my old chi dryer  love this item     very quiet    you will love it      loved that it had three heat settings and two speeds  did what a dryer was suppose to do  however  it is a bit noisy and it crapped out on me pretty quickly  from other reviews  i would say don t buy it if you want a hair dryer that lasts more than a year to two years max  great hair dryer  dries hair very quick  my daughters have very long hair and they love it as well  it is the same model the pros use  i have been very happy with this hairdryer  it is fast and leaves my hair shinner than my old hair dryer  love it  if you want a high end hair dryer for the right price  you ve come to the right place  i was looking into chi hairdryers   200  300  when i found this one by farouk  i decided to go ahead and try it out  and i love it  the comb attachment is my favorite part   it kind of massages my head while i use it and it makes my hair less frizzy  and that s saying something since i live in texas    the nozzle attachment is also easy to use and gives a great blowout  it s just a great hair dryer and i recommend it to anyone  great little dryer with lots of power  compact size and wall mount save space  don t let that compact size deceive you  though  because it dries hair very quickly  i have used this dryer for almost 3 years now  my daughter liked it so much that i bought this for her this christmas  she now is as happy as i am   it is fairly light weight but has the power of a professional  this is the best standard blow dryer on the market plenty of power and heat nothing else compares this will keep that 80 s hair blown back for shure this was made for bon jovi   rod stewart types  this is a good high end hair dryer at a cheap hair dryer price   after my last cheap one stopped working  i saw this and figured i would splurge     why i am happy     it is light and quiet   it dries hair quickly   it has a long cord   the comb attachement is handy and securly clicks on  it is bright orange so you will not lose it       both myself and dd have fizzy hair   after drying her hair with the comb attachment is was softer and less frizzy    the result was wow     my hair    used the dryer as i was brushing my teeth and wiping down the counter so it still came out frizzy but when i used my chi iron on it  the process was quicker and my hair was smoother       this is a good product  only problem     is it takes some pressure to release the button for the cord to recoil  but that is about it  i like it and it works great  this is a great product   i wish i had bought it years ago   works great  was easy to install   i love it  this is a great product   i wish i had bought it years ago   works great  was easy to install   i love it  i was really surprised when i gotr this hair dryer   it was way better than what i expected for the price   i was really thrilled and i am really satisfied with this product i absolutely love this hairdryer  my hair is healthier  shinier and i feel like i m done in no time  i absolutely love this hairdryer  my hair is healthier  shinier and i feel like i m done in no time  abolutely love this  it hangs easily and is one of the best dryers we have owned  abolutely love this  it hangs easily and is one of the best dryers we have owned  i try for the first time ionic hair dryer and i have to say  it works  the andis tourmaline hair dryer is better than i thought  makes my hair feel much much softer  the blowing is strong and faster than normal hair dryers do  so   trust it     worth it  i bought this wall mounted dryer to free up some space in the kids bathroom  and it works great  the nightlight is nice and bright and the dryer isn t too loud  the bracket mounted easily once i pounded the raised ground screw terminal flat  the bracket won t lay flat against the wall with the raised ground screw terminal on the bracket  the cord hook on the dryer mounted easily and works wonderfully  i ve only had it a couple of weeks  but everyone in the family really likes it  the conair blackbird is the best non professional hair dryer out there  multiple settings and 2000 watts make for fast drying without burning  i bought this product about 6 7 years ago at a local store and loved it   when it wore out i was so happy to find amazon had the identical item  i couldn t believe how fast it arrived and it works just as good as the first one   i really like having the wall mount design and it s simple to use  a great price for a wonderful product  i have always loved using these great hair dryers at hotels and thought it would be great to have one att home  and it is   no more messes on the counter or sink  and you never have to wonder which drawer it is in    i have always loved using these great hair dryers at hotels and thought it would be great to have one att home  and it is   no more messes on the counter or sink  and you never have to wonder which drawer it is in    it s very good  it has two levels viz low and high  i wish if there was a medium level  works on both 110 and 220 volts ac  i love the jerdon 1600w wall hair dryer   this is the second one that i have and it works great  we were traveling and in one hotel my husband commented this wall mount hair dryer is great   next morning i ordered one from amazon   it arrived 3 days later and he is a happy man  i was looking for a new hair dryer b c mine did not have the concetrator attachment and the universal wouldn t fit   so i found this one and it had a great price and had pretty good reviews on other websites but a great price here   i got a great deal with the flat iron as well   it s perfect   it drys my hair much quicker and my hair feels softer and looks better than it did with just the regular hair dryer   i would absolutely recommend this item  this hair dryer was recommended to me by a coworker after i commented on how nice her hair looks  sturdy construction  retractable cord  great price  and my hair looks much better with this blow dryer than others in the same price range  the product was exactly as described and works great   we placed it in our guest bath and not only do they have a hair dryer  but a night light as well   thanks  searched for this dryer after trying it in a hotel and loving how great my hair looked   still happy with the way it dries my hair  but have found the same problem others have with the retractable cord   it worked great for a month and now will not retract   a bit of a nuisance that spoils overall satisfaction  but still worth buying  this hair dryer was awesome until it broke after only about a year of use  still a pretty good price  but i won t buy the same item for fear that it will break again  having recently broken my wrist and also having hand function issues  this is the perfect dryer for me  i also loved the price and it is supposed to be a high quality dryer that should last for years  so what else could you want  i have never used more than high and never use those cool shots or ionic type dryers  this fits my needs perfectly  love it  i have been using the hair dryer for almost a month   it works great and has nice features like the cool air blast and the night light   to me  it is a lot quieter than my old dryer  and mounting it on the wall only took a few minutes  the night light is perfect for the size of bathroom it is in   if the motor lasts longer than 3 mos   which is all my jerdon dryer lasted   this is an excellent product     i have a very old conair prostyle 1600   my favorite hand held dryer  and after over 10 years  it s been on its way out   i ve tryed various dryers  but none of them have the great feel of my old conair   i just recently ordered the conair yellowbird 1875   thought it would be great   looked just like my old one  only yellow   i tried it once and sent it back   it was too heavy  unlike the conair 1600  which was oh so light   and surprisingly didn t have the blow power i expected   so i read one review on the andis pro style 1600 and it sounded good   i tried it this morning and it s perfect   very light   and so small  i couldn t believe it   i travel on business and have not found a travel dryer i m happy with  so i m going to order another of these for a travel dryer  it works  the cord feature is great  the price is right  what else is there to say  it works  the cord feature is great  the price is right  what else is there to say  i love my andis ionic ceramic hair dryer  i throw it in my travel bag  it has all the power of a bigger  heavier dryer     i love the retracting cord and folding feature  it stores neatly at home as well   awesome product  i love my andis ionic ceramic hair

quite often to beach resorts  i needed a dual voltage 220v hair dryer  not more than 1600 watts    this hair dryer works very well   i will buy soon an adapter plug  usa to europe    this is the best blow dryer i ever had  this dryer is the perfect size for travel and its performance is outstanding  this dryer is the perfect size for travel and its performance is outstanding  this dryer is the perfect size for travel and its performance is outstanding  this is a replacement for the same model hair dryer   the first one lasted over 6 yrs   i like the convenience of having it mounted on the wall rather than taking space on the counter   i could not find one in the local stores and found the best price on amazon com great hair dryer  i tried it in on of hotels  liked a lot and bought 5 for each room in the apartment  powerful  nice grip  light and not too noisy  great price  too  great hair dryer  i tried it in on of hotels  liked a lot and bought 5 for each room in the apartment  powerful  nice grip  light and not too noisy  great price  too  this is a good product at a good price  i wish for more choices high medium low power and heat but it does a real good job and the night light has been a bonus for our guests i have used this product for 6 years  my hairdresser introduced me to it and i now use it at home  its great for mustache areas and eyebrows  it grabs the fine hairs and doesnt let go  i highly recommend this   i wholeheartedly agree with another reviewer that this product is awesome   it leaves my hair soft  shiny  sleek and smooth with not a trace of dryness or frizziness   pair it with the t3 tourmaline featherweight hairdryer and you ll have salon quality hair   highly recommend  none available  it s o much better than lotion     i ve been using lotions and going to tanning beds for a while  i decided to try this just because it was on sale and it turned out to be great    you have to follow directions to get expected results    and everytime you apply it you get better at it  i like to apply it right after a shower  use lotion before applying   great natural color  dries quick  no weird smell  doesn t turn pamls orange  doesn t tranfer to clothes i use organic root stimulator to freshen my scalp after a workout  good stuff  be careful not to overuse this product  it will cause buildup on your scalp if you use it too often  nothing fully replaces a vigorous scalp scrub in the shower  like its predecessor  this does make your lips a deeper color and a  teensy weensy bit plumper  but i ve been using it for 1 week now and have my doubts about  maxiderm s  collagen boosting effect   if my opinion changes  i ll update the review but as of now  i d say save the 10 bucks and get original lip venom   okay     update   it works     after 2 weeks of two to three times a day application  my pout is definitely poutier   yay   also  i tested it on an 18 year old co worker  i am 30  and it had immediate results   hmmm  don t know why  but yes  great product  it works  none available  okay  i haven t owned a new hair dryer for over 25 years  but i must say  this one is exactly perfect and has everything i would ever want in a hair dryer   it has a retractible chord and is and dries my hair quickly  leaving it soft and frizz free   i highly recommend this product  hair dryer worked good for about 1 year  then the switch broke  fused in the open position i would not buy an andis product again  i got this for christmas and i love it   it is very high powered for being a hello kitty hair dryer   i was surprised   it is very cute with a great price  this is exactly what i expected and works very good  worth the cost  the bonnet is nice and large and the air flow is just right for my hair   it has done a good job for me

because my wife and daughter fight over it i bought another one   it has a 5 year warranty that will be honored   if t3 wants to loose out on amazon sales by being jerks about the warranty  let them
