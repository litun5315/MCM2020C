my son loves this one and will only sleep if he has this one  he likes them over all the others and that s what matters  giant  way too big  sizing is way off  needed to be returned  didn t work at all bought for a friend and she loves this product works like it should   my 3yo loves this towel  it is holding up well  trees were smaller than i thought but made them work  grandson likes them the same designe i choose not recive   the one what i got is deffrinet    works for my newborn baby loves it       the only pacifier that my baby will use tommee tippee pacifiers are the only ones my baby will use   i just wish you could choose the colors  my baby didn t like those  she likes the mam pacifiers instead  for my granddaughter   she has been raised on avent pacifiers and bottles   her mother swears by this product  the only bunny my daughter would take  the smell is okay  the color is deep green  which is good  but the taste os horrible   you can t find these in the retail stores  these are a life saver  my son will only use this pacifier  i wish the animal would come off and attach to another paci  my lo likes the puppy but chokes on the paci every time  excelent choice  my son did not like these pacifiers but they are food quality  only pacifiers my son will use  gave this as a shower gift  it was a hit with everyone  i wish i could ve picked the design  it does the job i wanted baseball like pictured but got football can t wait to use jt my baby loves these  my son just loves wubbanub  with they had a fox though   wink wink  only ones my son will use these are the only binky my newborn will take and work like a charm  8 18 2015 works well  this is just a hair trimmer   it shaves hair off  but i cannot imagine it is permanently removed  the only sippy cups we use  8 18 2015 just what i needed  i did received a different design so i decided to remove the paci to my boy out of all the pacifiers i ordered all had holes on the end of nipple so when baby sucked she sucked air  works well  worked well to get the potty training started   but broke only after 2 weeks this is a must have as promised  it is for big kids  my nephew loves it  gets the job done    just another baby gift excelente producto 8 15 2015 it gets the job done  but it s also a bit flimsy  eep  bought as a gift for an upcoming baby shower  but is the same brand i used when my children wore cloth diapers  picture says it all  i purchased it for my dogs  but no interest on their part  this is the only   34 cork  34  that my baby will accept they dont have a hole for the strap got what i wanted excelente cutest thing ever  i die when i see my son using this pacifier  stays in mouth and cleans well  my son isn t a fan of this item  but he might just need to grow into it  bought as gift made the wipes smell mildewy got this to help ease bathing the dogs but of course will be using it also for our baby girl coming later this year  i like the concept  but the stickiness of back wears off  i ve only had this for a week  and the one i used on my cabinet below my kitchen sink came off already  probably won t buy again my baby took time to get usedto these pacifiers  she was using the avent newborn and those are a bit harder and these are way too soft  i feel like she doesn t feel anything in her mouth  i don t like that soap gets stuck inside when i wash it  the nicu introduced our daughter to these paci s they are a life saver  hospitals trust them in preemies  this is the only brand my daughter will take  so obviously it is 5 stars  my son loves these  im not really satified with this beacuse the pacifier cant be takin out so i can wash plush it self beofre giving it to my one month old baby my daughter loves these i should have read the description  it only comes with two instead of four  prefect in every way  a lot smaller and thinner than i thought but it will work temporarily  expectations met no rust yay  awsome excelente product it had a rip in it when it arrived  baby could not use it  i bought these to tell my lions fan husband he was going to be a father   we had a girl  but she still used them for the games    my baby loves her wubbanub kitty  as described baby approved  i chose the blue bottles that had the monkeys on them but i received the ones with airplanes one them  i wanted to get the ones i ordered  my daughter loves these  there the only pacifer she will take  i wish i found these sooner  as sold in shops  the visible darkness rim is a selling point  for a shower   haven t given them yet my baby loves it  these work well  they are the only brand my daughter will keep in her mouth  bottles leak   my baby does like this at all  he doesn t like the soothie pacifier at all  every baby needs one  as advertised as described  arrived on time  no damage  no issues  she loves her binky  my son loves it the one pacifier my granddaughter would take   yay  cutest binkys i ve ever purchased  my daughter loves them  and all mam products   deff reccomend these  can t wait to see them on my grandson  ordered for my grandson and he loves it  the pink smoothie has a hole in it  it s very troubling since the package was closed  does it s job  can t leave home without our   34 puppy   34  baby loves it this is smaller than i thought it would be my niece loves it  only pacifier my baby will use   they work and the wipes are big  but not too big  got what i asked for byt my son didn t take to it  he prefers a different shaped teat baby loves it   these are the only binkies my daughter will use and she loves them my breastfed baby loves these and we have ordered two pairs from amazon and purchased one from walgreens  one out of each package had a hole in the paci causing my son to suck in air  so out of the 6 we purchased we are left with 2  i am now on the quest looking for another paci  we can t even return because i just threw them away  these are the only pacifiers my daughter will take  only brand i buy the only passed by that my son loves my baby will take just about any pacifier  except for this   it s probalbly a matter of preference though     the only brand my baby will take  fits up to 3 pacifiers  that was a shocker  7 12 2015 my son loves it my son loves these  this is the only pacifier my son likes   i like that it is similar to a bottle so it doesn t confuse him  size is too big to 3 month baby  got lots of laughs at my cousin s baby shower from this doesnt always work  the closing part when it hits the floor  flimsy hook kept coming off everything and bending  threw it away  i ordered the blue  they did not have holes in the nipple and my son keeps them in his mouth  cutest  he doesn   like it she still not a fan of the pacifier  not specifically this one  any of them  a gift for a newborn baby  baby loves ut buy colors for child and sent me girl colors my baby loves this  baby lives these  i can find them at night  i got this because i wanted a paci i can hold from the handle  unfortunately  this one leaves imprints on my baby s cheeks  she s got bigger cheeks than most babies  she still loves sucking on it  so it s my emergency paci  have purchased two of the wubbanub   my son loves it  everyone thinks this is the cutest thing ever  the baby loves it too  my daughter loves this  i like how you can adjust the height  the product came to me well and on time

pacifiers are the way to go  if you don t  have any you should try them  no more turning the light on to find it  i have a boy  what is the logic for receiving a girl pacifier  well  i got fooled by

ask me all the time where i got this  i like how these are made  my baby however prefers the nuk brand orthodontic pacifiers instead   i like the necklace but it is definitely purple  not navy  buen producto pratique et tres utile just like the ones received in the hospital  our baby doesn t even use it as a pacifier  but she still likes to hold the stuffed animal at bedtime  my daughter loves wubbanubs   although she is not on the paci anymore she still likes to play with the stuffed animal part  not detachable   how am i suppose to sanitize this  got them for my granddaughters    excelente exacty what i was looking for  baby loves it  does the job  beutiful  my son loves wearing this   and loves being walked around in this as well  thought these would be thicker than they are

i bought this for my sons halloween costume  it does the job  my daughter doesn t like these which i m sad about  i wish i tested other pacis first  other than that they are just okay  was a gift gift my daughter loves it my 18 month old twins are doing well as the learn to hold these spoons  i love that i can angle the spoon to the side so they can   awkwardly  scoop their food  p seems to be working   my son feels like a big boy with his potty watch   helping the process granny s way of letting baby know who to pull for  gave as a gift  works as described  no fitment issues whatsoever  can t push one handed  this is such a nifty invention   i can attach it anywhere  purchased for a baby shower and the child loves it  my granddaughter loves hers  thx as a gift       a big fan of dr  browns products   this product doesn t disappoint the only pacifier my son will take but not always however i like the design and the fact that it s non toxic works like a champ     none i m like a gift  my daughter didn t like it were not quite the ones we were looking for  were looking for the longer nipples she loves these pacifiers these save our life when he wakes up at 5am    you can see where the paci is and pop it back in before the freakout  the only brand that our baby will use  for some reason this is the only style our son likes   can t have enough of them on hand  shuts up your kids as advertised  i don t choose color  life savers  it came with all 4 suction cups plus foam stickers if i wanted to permanently attach it to the wall  my son hasn t used it as a potty yet    he thinks it s a soldier helmet and wears it on his head     i washed this pillowcase once and it came apart at the seams  waay overpriced for the quality  9 29 2014 these weren t very durable  had trouble sticking them to the wall in my classroom  she loves this toy  the baby loves it simple and convenient baby loves it    a        no use does the job    bling bling baby would swipe hand and knock it out of her mouth  overpriced it entertains the children didn t come with the pacifiers as indicated  bien my son loves these cost  9 99 br   my picky infant didn t take this brand pacifiers my daughter loves it excelent excelent excelent does not rash my babies like everything else on the market today  work as advertised   as with any glue on device  the sticky tape must be renewed occasionally  my daughter loves these bought this for a friend s baby shower  she loves it  luv it   it s cute but my son thinks it s sad because of how the face looks every baby  needs one my son loves it just as described we like it this pacifier projectiles across the room  the nipple design doesn t work well for our son  my girl loves her wubbies  these are the only ones my baby will use  okl we like it granddaughter loves it  we like it does the job  as always wubbanub to the rescue     my friends newborn loves it  there is no chasing the bike constantly with these  shower gift these are the only pacifiers that my daughter will use  my baby hates these pacifiers  br   i wish she would take them but she refuses  this is ralph and our baby loves him  the only pacifier my son will use  it s been months and i still haven t recieved my product  i have reordered these probably 5 times  my lo loves them  they were the only ones that didn t leave a dent around his lips from where he sucked  9 8 2014 wouldn t stay locked after awhile  excelente gracias my daughter loves this seat   no complaints whatsoever  excelente gracias just as described just like the ones from the hospital  brought for grandson   he enjoys  just what i was looking for  perfeita  i ordered these and received navy blue pacifiers with red and blue braves logos  uhnn    genius    it fell apart within a couple of times of using it  my kid can t here enough of his froggie  it s now his comfort toy  i have 3 thank you  baby loves it  8 31 2014 the middle is not as sturdy as the baby bjorn stool i recently purchased  and because my daughter pushes or drags the stool around  the rubber on the bottom is coming off  8 31 2014 8 31 2014 see prior review on this product    adorable and silly  exelente i think this is the cutest trio  bought this to cover a wedding cake   worked like a dream  it didnt cover my pack and play hurts your back this is the cadillac escalade of baby buggies   bought for my daughter as a baby shower gift  br   durable and the combo of car seat and carriage can t be beat  cuty  works well  keeps the pumps in place  excelente gracias  my 17 month old son loves to walk around stores with me but he s not great at remembering to hold my hand  this solves the problem and it s discreet enough that i don t get as many nasty looks as i would if i put him in a traditional kid harness leash  it s a great tool for teaching him to remember to hold hands and it gives him the freedom to get out of the cart or carriage and explore the world  babies can hit their heads on the door frames and injure themselves  these are a choke hazard  they don t stay on the corners of anything  mine did not come with any adhesive or stickers or anything to keep them in place  would not recommend them item delivered on time  it was as described does not help one bit helped make pumping easier baby hates them  our daughter loves this giraffe  it worked well for us and lasted almost 2 years  no she has a giraffe  2  can t wait to recieve it loves his philly pacifier  my baby just doesn t like this pacifier at all  durable product at an affordable price excelente producto      my daughter loves her wubbanub s too big for 6 month baby too big to suck to 6 month baby the only pacifier my baby will accept   i bought 12 of these because  like socks  they disappear  as described holds in the smell  washes up well  my 8 month daughter lives this  she loves it    no prob my grandbaby loves it almost like the ones from the hospital these rock  only thing my daughter will take  were given these in the hospital too  baby loves them   yase this was the brand and model my girl was given at the hospital and that s all she s ever used  excelente muy buenos exelentes not the color i choose these are the only pacifiers that my daughter will use  they also used these in the hospital   they are shaped to prevent nipple confusion  she loves it like excelente my daughter loves this and won t go to sleep without it  kiut   but packaging was damaged person loves this gift the battery discharges faster excelent product as grandparents  we purchased these for our granddaughter  the pricey disposable diapers were giving her baby boy a diaper rash as well as these do save money  works perfects for the ikea changing table  these wipes have multiple uses   these are safer to use when cleaning surfaces that come in contact with children s mouth  i e   toys  pacifiers  and breast pumping flanges   they were just what i wanted  i got this for a friend and she got a nether one she loves it i sent this to my neice who is potty training  she called to thank me but said the battery did not work when she received it  cutest diaper bag i have ever seen   has everything   she loves it  as described a must have  excelent product and seller  100  recomended  this memory book has everything you could possibly want to document with plenty of spaces for pictures  it does not work  i am returing it  it s smaller than i thought  my granddaughter loves her napmat  her baby dolls likes it  our daughter uses this all the time  this model stays in her mouth easiest  the color is not the same the the lips gums looked red excelente excelente no problems my son loves his dragon this was a hit at the baby shower i went to  baby loves em this item will go in the pinata for my daughter s baby shower  bought at an affordable price  what can i say  it   a pacifier it says when u order it its personalized although mine wasnt     but still its a patty so it works    these were suppose to be scented and they were not  my daughter loves it she can hold it buy her self to prepare for the future baby  rest assured to use again the pacifier that the hospital gave us and the only one she will use  my baby loves them 1 0 7 28 2014 i think all parent should get the  sing  for theist kids room  i know  i did  to reminder  her who  she  is and where  she is going in  her life present for my grandson  he just loves it bought for my grandson who was teething   did not work like it said it would  the only paci we could use  and now its the only we would use excelente my baby is 6 months and it is too big for her face  it hits her nose  not a fan of the product but can t complain about the shipping or price  i later learned that these are not preferred by breastfed babies the only problem is that there s no way to attach these to my baby s clothes   wish they could be used with some sort of leash so they don t get dropped so often  my daughter loves these things   she has four wubbanub pacifiers  our friends and family can t stop laughing every time my son uses this pacifier  double bonus is my son loves it too  just what i need granddaughter loves binkie ripped off ducky in 3 days  the only pacifier my baby will accept  my son couldnt hold a pacy in his mouth by his self since he is a preemie  this has helped him get the soothing he needs and he loves to hold it  bought for daugter to carry in her diaper bag  daughter loves it  kid loves it but figures get stuck in it  did not come as pictured awsome  i can choose the color and dont have to wait to see what color they are does not leak   says it all  they re hangers  they do their job  likes it 7 12 2014 dont feet in a lot of places    they teld you and it eas my fault but they can change that    according to the specifications online it was exactly what i needed  but when i recieved it it was too small for my sons crib bellisimos gave it as a gift after trying some  i give this pacifier a try because it was orthodontic  now my daughter only likes this one and never used again the others  i wish it comes with a cap as advertised grandson joshua loves it and every boy needs a puppy   7 8 2014 our baby boy just loves it  he spends almost 2 hours every day through out the day on his jumperoo  my baby didn t like it to be swaddle in this  i rather use a cotton blanket  thank you gift go gators    arrived after baby shower   will save for next girl baby shower  almost works but would trust it all the way fits mattress well and holds up after washing  baby likes    coloring not too offensive fussy looking  i have received the item    avent pacifiers rule   my nieces came home from the hospitals with them and my sister swears by this mold   a pair is always included for every baby shower gift  these are the only pacifier that he will use  wont leave home without one  product is as described  my girl loves it ordered the evenflo breast pump and after the third time of using it it quit working  and ordered a second one and it quit working too after the third time of using it  i am not a fan of the forks since the 2 inner pieces are the only ones that you can stab food with  however  they get the job done  thank you  used this with my car seat several times   the bag has stood up longer than i d imagined  not a day passes without needing these  br   they re hollow and see through  looking through the cavity while the baby is chewing on them is mesmerising 0 0 hehe br   plus  if you look at them while the nipple is facing you directly  you ll notice that they re shaped to look like a smiling pinocchio  o  granddaughter loves it  my son loves his wubbanubs  i have given these are baby shower gifts on multiple occasions and bought them for my two nieces  i always get the same review from the moms     34 my child loves her his wubbanub     34  6 27 2014 6 27 2014 my baby doesn t use a pacifier but she uses it to chew on while she s teething  we don t leave home without it  we tried all kinds   this one was the only one she would take   the hospital had these when our kid was in the nicu so we kept using them  i brought the pacificers as a gift for my grandson   it was exactually what i wanted  its for my sons  son  needs a cover and a strin but it works greeat  it always falls from her mouth without a string  but     i bought these in bulk so we weren t constantly looking for the pacifier  i put 2 or 3 in daughter s crib so she can look for it at night and self soothe  when i receive the packet it came with a hair  i m dissatisfied with product i don t recommended the product to no one i choose blue as in the picture br   but i got red and this asharni malaise br   i have a child born and preferred color blue didn t like red my daughter s must have   she has to have 2 at a time   one in her hand and one in her mouth   price is cheaper than stores they tell you to pick colors but send you whatever  we asked for girl colors and got boys  guess it happens  works the product is equal to what they promote  it met my expectations  recommended 100   i have no complaints  i agree with what you buy i did not receive the pacifier  i received the wron product one pacifier clip for keeps the pacifier close to your baby  seals the bottle every time   keeps the milk where it should be  br    br   unlike there freezer bags   that is an entirely different story  the pacifier came apart from the stitching onto the lamb within just a week     i had to reattach it with supper glue  i dont know if it was out kids or what  however we couldnt get either of them to use this thing  these are the only pacis my daughter will use and they don t have them anymore in my toys r us or target   thank g d  he put those in his mouth all day and all night and they are his toys too he likes to play them  recommended along with te avent bottles that were purchased as a baby shower gift  the bottles were on a gift registry my baby loves it         she was amazed to have a toy and pacified that she could hold and play with  it is offered on the website 3 27 2014 my 3rd  and last baby  is a bon ified pacifier baby  and i don t have a problem with it    he looooooves these pacis  he will not take anything else  and won t even take the   34 wrong  34  color of pacifier  they definitely soothe him and he uses them mostly at nap and bed time  bought this for my granddaughter and she has a blast in it  plus there are lots of places to attach toys so she can t drop them   added bonus the ones we hung she crawls over to a plays with on her back  my daughter loves this    she is a breastfed baby and this is the only thing that calms her when i m at work i wish they were thicker  i still use them but will not be buying a second pack  i do like that they are soft but not very absorbent and often need a second wipe to finish the job  my granddaughter loves the ducks  she has begun to collect them and loves making videos with them  these ducks have been carried everywhere  the seat keeps my sons head from leaning foward while he sleeps  now he can just lay to the side  frankly  although this is marketed as a child s nightlight  i wouldn t mind having one myself   bought for all my grandsons  4 in two states   and they cannot go to bed without it  for a few years now   it really makes the ceiling splendiferous   they can choose a different color each night   i would have to say that no child should be without one   period  2 26 2014 everything was just like it was described   in package  it was unopened  as described and was unused as described also  2 23 2014 2 23 2014 discription says 0 6 months  but on the package i saw 0 3 months only  my daughter did not like it  stored only  i bought this for my nephew but had to throw this item away it had a recall on it    bought 4 of these  they are the only textured pacifiers he will take   we have tried others from babies r us     i bought bottles and received pacifiers  br   the picture contain bottles and the title of the product is pacifier  br   i didnt pay attention to the title and bought based on the picture  pacifiers were delivered  br   mistake of amazon com br    br   denise my son was such a fan of the wubbanub  now i buy them for all my friends that are expecting  my son takes it to be with him every night  he is 2  he can turn in on him self and it he forgets to turn it off  it turns off in 30 minutes  my son loves this and always asks for his giraffe  after losing dozens of binkys i wish i would have had this from the start  these pacifiers are wounderful  they are flush enough that they don t get knocked out while my son is sleeping  he loves them   any pacifier only works with the mood of your child  my son always pushes these out of his mouth  constantly  plus i took them to my dentist and he said not to use them because all of his teeth would not come in correctly  my neighbor said do not even worry about it because they are just baby teeth anyway  should i continue to use them  2 6 2014 i ve read reviews in which the reviewer writes about an odor or rancid smell  i have not found that to be the case  a lady in our church is having a baby and this is one of the items she requested as a gift  it fits a lot of stuff inside  not just dr  brown s products  we go through lots of bottles and pumping equipment and only have to run it twice a day  max  i really do love this binki  i am sad that the baby hasnt taken to it and that the animal doesnt detach from the actual soothie br    br   i received it on the day they said i would get it   when someone won t stop complaining about wes welker leaving the pats for denver  this is the cutest way to make them stfu  this maybe the last one   but i don t think so   she loves this type of  pacifier   can be washed and or boiled thank you i received cant wait to use it br   i havent yet taken out of the plastic will soon enough this stays put wherever i placed it  i put it on my steps and corners for my toddler  i had tile steps in kitchen and living room  also have wood steps and countertop edges  none have fallen off  it did not work  hoping we can return it  it was a gift to my granddaughter  now my daughter must try to return it  1 12 2014 this dragon soother has saved us countless pick ups off the floor   when the soother pops out we have time to get it before it slides off her body   she also pets the plush dragon while soothing herself so it serves two purposes  i don t know that we have a non standard oven  but this definitely does not work on our oven  and i can t imagine a way that it would work on any oven  when the baby drops them  the dogs have a party  easier to keep off the floor than the standard pacifier my baby loves this pacifer but i don t give it to her because the sides are not meant for her big cheeks  she always had red marks on the sides on her face from it  i tried size one and two  philips avent bpa free soothie pacifier  green  3  months  6 pack  three sets of two pacifiers  6 green soothies total  just like the one the hospital gave us except in blue and the only pacifier my son will take  lifesaver  a must have    the wubbanub held my son s pacifier in  or close enough he could reach it  through the night  eliminates that constant searching through the bed trying to find a paci  my son loves these  this is the same one that comes on the wubbanub and my son likes the soothies  i buy them for every friend i know having a baby  you will always have a paci on hand with this  it attaches wherever you need it so you won t be without one  the nipple is too short  baby didn t like it  probably because we used a different pacifier before buying this one  my  boy and daughter in law being a wyoming cowboy fans i thought this might look the part  on my newest grandson only pacifier that works  i now what to reorder  but the picture shows a bottle     br    br   what am i ordering  the item name or what s on the picture        11 30 2013 sticks well to the corners of my table   have bumped the corners often with my hip and the edges remain on the table  i don t see a problem with them  but my son would rather use avent or soothie pacifiers  he just ins t a fan of the gumdrop  11 24 2013 after using this with our newborn to help reduce the number of times we d have to pick up a dropped pacifier from his mouth while soothing him  we became instant fans   it s now my go to gift for moms to be   it s saved our sanity a number of times already  11 20 2013 these do the job but they are so pricy  i actually prefer the gerber training underwear over these and they are a fraction of the price at  7 for a three pack   11 13 2013 exlente it falls apart when my boy trys to use it and it is not well made its i would tell people not to buy it these are the cutest pacifiers i ve bought my grandson  even though i wish he would give them up  i would rather he have these that look like a bigger boy  i bought the avent pacifier like as picture  but they send me another color  totally different that show at picture br    br   i m sa br    br   bianca i was what i was lloking for   im expecting my baby and this pacifier are perfects br   thank you      i will be getting another one for my granddaughter  her kitty chewed the nipple off the one i got her and she will not take anything esle  she loves to hold the giraffe  my baby takes this pacifier  it s a miracle  and he loves grabbing at the lamb to hold in his hands  she requested it so hopefully she doesn t have any complaints  br   and now i just scribble on here bc i have too i ve purchased this machine to blend fruit for my baby  it s saved me a lot of time since i no longer need to use the big blender  would definitely recommended this purchase  i purchased this item for my daughter  she loves the bag  i would consider another one of a different color  i put my kids snack in this and they eat it in the stroller  it holds a lot and holds their drink in place  it s adorable  baby loves it   my only issues are that i m unable to put it in my steam sterilizer and you can t change out the pacifier should it become damaged  my daughter lives these things  she can hug it to hold it close and fling it across the room at 2 months  my grandson loves his wubbanub brown puppy  i got him a blue one too  he is just beginning to hold things and likes to grip on the stuffed puppy  my baby loves that  he has 3  different ones  it is easier to find by himself during the night in the crib i use it for 1 month and it broke inside and on the outside for just 1 month of usage my son calls his pacifiers   34 ball  34  because he loves the sports themed nuk pacifiers   we got all basketball ones sent to us when we ordered  just fyi my son loves these  and i do too  we have about 20 of them in every part of the house   it served it s purpose   the baby was folded over  and the pacifiers had to be cut out   did not like that  my son was born during the baseball season and he must have known it too   he will only use texas rangers pacifiers to go to sleep  my newborn did not like these  but we bought 10 different pacifiers and she didn t like any of these either  my oldest loves her nuks  so i have no idea why these didn t cut the mustard  br    br   they are cute  durable and well cut to suit a newborn s face  br    br   i m so sad  now i am a pacifier for the foreseeable future  this product would be great for a kids party  you have to cut out all of the pacifiers which was a bit annoying  8 28 2013 this will do the job but it s really big and baggy looking  we gave it away to a friend who wanted it and i m going to make something for my daugter s room  it was excatly what i want it  my son enjoys it everytime he is in his crib br   and i get to relax br   thank you  we were given these for our preemie in the hospital  and have been using it ever since  he s sort of grown out of having a pacifier  but we still keep them around just in case  just used this once when checking out the hospital with our maxi cosy car seat  after 2 weeks  we tried to use it again but the baby felt irritated because the fabric is not breathable too 8 5 2013 i would like to hear the environment voices but this does not support it well  when my child cries i can hear it while there is no voice aorund me   this product is the cutest item   i just could not have picked a cuter theme for my grandson s son we r expecting in oct 2013    the manufacturer had to change the design of this    the crib mattress no longer goes all the way up to make a changing table  7 22 2013 my kid has an obsession with pacifiers  will only use mams  if we try others  he freaks out  i like them too  i have to admit that i should be happy as this is one of the only pacifier my daughter likes    but i just hate that every time she uses it  it leaves marks on her face because of how the plastic part is shaped    br   but the inner part she loves  so i am doomed to use it  kid spits it out every time  can t sterilize it in a steamer cuz it s got metal parts on it   blagh bought  this for my nephew   he loves it    he loves all wubbanubs   they are also easier to keep track of than regular passifiers  our daughter loves it and it allows for both my wife and i to do homework while our daughter plays  7 6 2013 purchased it for thigh friction  but there seems to be something in it that irritates me  doesn t work for me  7 6 2013 we use it when we are changing his diaper and at night when he is in his swing  br   he loves the music and looking at the images on the wall and ceiling it does the job  and it doesn t matter what type of pacifier you use  i use it with the soothie   but it could be used with any type  i think  7 6 2013 it s a bit deceiving saying that this is a 4 pack when in fact it s sold as two sets of two   i only needed two of the pacifiers and would have preferred to just get the one pack  it s well made and gets a ton of double takes and compliments  my baby is always the hit of the party    and he has no idea why     parents  if your baby likes to put their hands by their face and move their arms a lot  this probably won t work  my son pushes binkibear away and the pacifier falls out  i bought these for our granddaughter and she loves them   she enjoys them in the bathtub as well as in the pool and at the lake  it just doesn t stay on when a baby pulls a door  does t stick well  waist of money  had to through it way i wash these before i make burp cloths   they were nubby out of the dryer   i won t put them on a baby  or use them for burp cloths i used at a house party and the conversation they started got me laid 3 times  may just be the confidence the stache brings out in you though 5 30 2013 everything you need in a baby monitoring camera br   i recommend it for everyone who need to check on their babies tried several others   a friend recommended these   this is the only pacifier my son would except when he was a newborn  not only is she a fan of the soothie pacifier  but she also likes the frog attached to it   it gives her something additional to play with  my baby girl loves wubbanub s  i bought the puppy   this one  when she would chew through the pacifier i would cut it off   she would still have her elephant  the stache s came on time and looked like the picture   no complaints about the company   the product was sticky enough to stay on  but don t change your facial expression as it will start to peel off  my son was having meltdowns every time we had to put him in the back of the car  this helped relax him and worked wonders  he has learned to push the buttons himself now and he loves hearing the changing sounds  4 17 2013 i like this pacifier pod because it matches the bag i purchased form jj cole   i look forward to using it  avent is the brand i have used with my two kids  the third is on the way and i didn t doubt keeping working with avent  4 14 2013 me encanta este producto y todo entregado en el momento acordado satisfactorio la compra y el envio recomendado totalmente buen vendedor i know this set is meant for kids  but i bought them for movie snack time  the smaller size will help in portion sizing  4 14 2013 i just recive 2  in the picture there are 4 and i wish you send the same that have the pictures wish we had figured this out sooner   pack and play without a mattress is like sleeping on the ground   she sleeps all night now  3 7 2013 this was a gift for my grandson  it was on a wish list  his parents like to read to him  he also has a captain calamary toy  this monster lovie is one of my daughter s favorites   she must have her   34 mon ser  34  when she goes to sleep every night  i got this as one of the gifts at a baby shower i went to and it was the hit of the party  2 25 2013 so sad that this wubbanub is useless for us   our older daughter has had the clifford one since she was a newborn and it was wonderful so we bought this one for baby  2   it is useless though   it has no weight to it so it doesn t stay in her mouth or on her chest and instead she pushes it out with every movement of her hands   it stays in less than a regular pacifier   boo   a friend is giving us the lamb and i hope that one is better     these are the only pacifiers my breastfed son will take   i think the shape is easier for breastfed babies  mouths to make the transition  muy util para limpiar la nariz del bebe  lo unico es que hay que tener cuidado con el recipiente deposito de fluidos  el mismo es un poco delicado en el sistema de cerrado  se rompen las pesta as y queda impedido para mantener el deposito en posicion  i ordered this pacifier for my granddaughter  because it worried me that she would sleep on the rigid pacifiers that we had   however  she does not like the taste of this one and will not use it  i received this item in blue color   it s different from the image they have on the image  i was expecting yellow ones  had to return it  1 31 2013 the product description stated there were two plates in the order   we only received one and it was not one of the plates pictured  minha filha comprou para os bebes que vao nascer  foi indicado por varias pessoas inclusive aqui no proprio amazon  ela vai usar quando os bebes nascerem se for preciso  baby loves it  it gives her something to hold on to and helps me to find her paci while i m up front in car my daughter will only use the avent soothie pacifiers and i hate them because they bounce when they hit the floor and we are constantly lose them  this product is great because it prevents them from falling to the floor  my daughter loves the caterpillar   she can t wait to give it to my granddaughter   the caterpillar design has sparked an entire theme of butterflies and caterpillars for my granddaughter s scrapbook  1 15 2013 my friend is the owner of this item so i ordered one for my stepsister who just had a baby  i kept this calendar in my daughter s room and wrote a few things in it each week   i then used it to make her baby book  i really like the stickers and set up of each month  came as described  i can not complain about anything   it works well with my medela pump and attaches to the model i bought  this doll is great  it has been teaching our 1yr  old the parts of the body  if doll isn t being touched for about a minute it says   i m bored    br   this is unnecessary  i just wish they were made of a thicker material cause my kids chew on them and then they break my nephew wasn t liking any of the pacifiers they tried  i got these for him and he loves them  now that he s 7 months he still uses them as teethers  1 3 2013 tried folding  the stroller with this attached and it doesnt fold  you need to take it off in order to fold it  the orthodontic design seems well done  and i like the air holes and handle  but our baby  3 months  can t keep it in his mouth without help   although this could be our baby and not an issue with the pacifier     i would recommed this to any mom that is looking for there babies  my son has two and loves them  i gave this to my newborn nephew since his mom was always losing his pacifier  now its always there to be found i bought this for my newborn granddaughter last year   it helped to sooth her to sleep so well that i ordered another one last month as a shower gift  i bought these for my lil son before he was born and he loves them  they are a life saver     my child would only take soothies but they bounced and rolled so we were always searching for one these land and don t roll  i did not want to use pacifiers however the nicu gave these to my daughter  she loves them and this is the only pacifier type she will not spit out  the item is just as i thought it would be  i haven t tried it out yet because baby isn t here but it will get tried out soon  we got one of these pacifiers at the hospital  i was hesitant to give my newborn a pacifier since we were exclusively nursing but it helps him because he likes to comfort nurse for 20 minutes beyond feeding  we ve had no issues with nipple confusion  the pacifiers are sturdy  and the lip on them helps with cleaning and retrieving without touch the part that goes in the baby s mouth  at 20  polyester these are too scratchy and not absorbent  who would even make a polyester washcloth  it makes no sense  this is the only pacifier my baby will take  it keeps him quiet and relaxes him so i give it all the stars for my baby shower i got around 8 different types of pacifiers   my newborn daughter wouldn t take any of them   i asked my friend   she recommended this one   bought it recently at baby s r us  2 pk for  4 99 and my baby will finally take it  yay  i bought these as extras and they give me peace of mind that i will never have a delay in using the breast pump  excelente producto  exacto al que ofrecen  lo esperado  adaptado para el bebe  colores estupendos  tama o muy acorde  llegada muy rapida  this product never got to my house it has been a month and i have contacted them twice it shows it sitting somewhere in wisconsin  and they won t do anything about it   my son wouldn t take a pacifier  but we tried this one and he would take it every once in a while    these are the cutest things  and trust me after 3 brothers she is definitely the princess  the pacifier just helps everyone else to know she is the princess  i have tried dr brown s pacifier and he hates it  now after my doctor s recommendation i got this and my baby loves it  my son will only use the gumdrop pacifiers  it was the brand given to him at the hospital  they have a holder that we can use to attach his pacifier holder  i ordered this wubba for my youngest son and he loves it  he loves all his wubbanubs but this one is the cutest    my daughter loves chewing on these  my fear however is that the regular elastic holding the beads could snap so i m constantly checking how it s holding up before letting her play chew on it  had no problems with installation   perhaps 20 mins   software is as advertised  no bells and whistles  just a monitor for ios that works   going to get a 2nd one  br    br   bought a 2nd one   again no problems whatsoever  i can toggle between the cameras with the software by two finger swiping   ez  baby loves them and mom does to  they wash well in the dishwasher  they also stand up to the baby chowing on them vendedor cumpli  con la entrega y expectativas del producto   vienen en paquete de dos  son los mjores pacificadores del mercado    we used this for about 1 month   it would not stay snapped to our diaper bag so we had to store it inside the bag   then the zipper broke   so now i am going to buy a different brand to replace it  not happy with the quality  could barely fit 2 nuk pacifiers in it  it needs measurements  but once you get used to it  you won t feel the need to measure the milk anymore  our daughter accepted it immediately  we got these at the hospital and they are the only ones my son will use  he can even put them into his mouth all by himself  i know it says colors and designs may vary  but i assumed since solid colors are pictured i was going to get solid pacifiers    i have no complain about the product   but the baby just do not like it   she takes any pacifier bu not this one    donno why   linda cartera de hannah montana para las ni as  llego a buen tiempo y a buen precio a mi sobrina le va a entantar como regalo de navidad i wish this harness had the ability to hook the handle on the side for when my son is walking next to me  also  forget the pocket   i don t even know why it s there  tiny   i also wish you could take off the leash and use it wrist to wrist  my son has been using this mattress for about six months now  he is 20lbs  9 months old  it sinks wherever he is sitting or laying  it doesn t seem to provide him with any support which i didn t think was a big deal for a baby but when you  can literally see it sink where he is laying you have to wonder  not recommended  so  i take responsibility for not reading the description well enough to realize that there are actually only 2 pacifiers but the picture gave the impression that there would be 4 pacifiers   i am pretty disappointed   the 2 stars is based solely on the item picture within amazon   we love these pacifiers and would give them 5 stars  my daughter loves this thing  she carries it around by the handle and enjoys her snacks all over the place  in the car  in the stroller  in the grocery store  etc  the only snacks i have to pick up are the ones she drops from her hand  not the ones she dumps out of the cup because those don t exist  yay  my daughter loves these rings  we took them apart   made numerous rings w  just 2 3 rings each  she loves to chew on them  this is just for a travel bag holds maybe three diapers  and i never use the pacifier bag  it does hold diapers though and no problems with leaking  my baby will not  under any circumstance use this pacifier  we use the nuk pacifier instead because that is what the hospital gave us my son wouldn t take any pacifier until i tried the wubbanub  it definitely soothes him to the point he falls asleep  i purchased these blocks to make the learning toy found on the mama jenn blog          click on education cubes link    basically you print out her premade inserts of letters  numbers  sight words  etc and insert them into the block instead of photos  i can use these for all kinds of learning games with all three of my homeschooling children  esta bonito los colores spon hermoso envio rapido lo unico la sabana del colchon arrugada el precio muy bueno por eso lo pude comprar me parece muy inteligentes q vendan productos buenos y con buen precio  otro detalle q no llego empacado en bolsa  por lo demas todo esta bien my baby had this pacifier since he was born  they had it at the hospital and the baby only likes those  these work well in an emergency but they do leave a funky taste that may need to be rinsed off  my baby loves these pacifiers and kids get a kick out of watching him suck on it because they can see the inside of his mouth  i bought this b c baby kept spitting out paci and i was constantly having to put it back in her mouth    while she is lying on her back i find it somewhat helpful  in yhe carseat  its a godsend  i was afraid the quality would be poor but it s a perfectly standard pacifier  i recommend it for fun and good spirits around you  i bought these for a friend and she told me that her son preferred these over all of the others she received for her baby shower  my granddaughter loves her  ellie    she also has a lamb  lucy  and her green frog  fred    very comforting for her and us  11 3 2010 oh yeah  these are a winner     we just run them thru the dishwasher every now and then   on the sanitizing cycle   works like a charm  wish i had the opportunity to choose the colours i got as ai got two of the same colours  i ordered these pacifiers because they are shown here as being neutral in color  but i recieved blue pacifiers with trucks on them   and i have a girl    its ok to say colors may vary if they work for both sexes  but this is not acceptable  needless to say  they are going back  these looked totally different than what is shown on picture  not even close    different color  different shape    i think this is one of the niceist carseasts out there and the color is gurgues this is the only pacifier my daughter will take   it is a life saver  i bought a 2 pack of these  and they became the de facto pacifiers for my girl  they are virtually indestructible  i accidentally bought these  and tried them with my baby anyhow  she doesn t like them at all  she prefers the gerber nuk pacifiers  my daughter likes her froggy   i only wish the pacifier was not sewn in so i could switch it out when it falls on the floor without a waterfountain in site  having four or five froggys in an already crammed diaper bag isn t practical   this is our second wubbanub  my son loves them  i do  wish you could somehow detach the pacifier to wash the animal  but they re affordable enough that i don t mind  replacing them  it s listed on amazon under a third party seller who charges almost  10 in shipping  the toy itself was  4       my son loves the wubbanubs the only thing i didnt like about the dog is that it didnt have the beanbag feet like the horse did she loves it  this is the pacifier that stays in her crib because she only sleeps with this one   videoid 24606481  a two sided review 6 23 2008 the sheet was way too small for a crib size mattress  i never expected that so had thrown away box  we washed and dried it before using it and there is no way the sheet could have fit any crib mattress did not like this item at all  the wings on the pacifer would not stay open so that the baby could use it  this item went in the trash
